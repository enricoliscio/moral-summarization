Polar bears will have less room to roam, crowding some of them out of existence. Birds will start flying an extra mile north each year, and may starve when they get there. These are among the dire possible consequences of global warming, say climate-change experts. At no time was it clearer that countries should take steps to slow this process than when 150 countries signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. But now, with President George Bush saying the US will not ratify the protocol - which was shaped in part to fit Washington\'s concerns five years ago - the accord\'s ultimate effectiveness is in doubt, and many US allies are irritated. For Japan, a nation of nature-lovers, the shaping of the accord on their soil was a source of pride - and proof that they were still relevant players on the world stage. ""It is absolutely inadmissible for the US, which is the greatest gas-emitting country, to once again turn its back and present something that is against Kyoto Protocol and the framework convention on climate change,"" says Mie Asaoka, president of the Kiko Network, a Tokyo environmental-umbrella organization representing about 150 Japanese groups. The clash over how to stop global warming while allowing sluggish economies to prosper occurs at an awkward point in US-Japanese relations. US analysts looking east say that as Japan\'s economic dominance in Asia diminishes, so will the importance of the US-Japan relationship as a whole. The US Department of Defense recently left Japan off its list of nations contributing to the post-Sept. 11 war on terror. Realizing the accidental slight, the US later apologized for overlooking Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi\'s efforts - considered tremendously ambitious here - to alter the interpretation of Japan\'s post-World War II pacifist constitution in order to dispatch warships for noncombat support. During Mr. Bush\'s visit here last month, Mr. Koizumi gently balked at the president\'s proposed alternative to the Kyoto agreement, saying that Japan would ""like to see further efforts"" on the part of the US. While there are no protesters in the streets, there is an air of indignation here over Washington\'s ""do-it-our-way"" decision on something that effects the whole globe. Among the Kiko Network\'s handouts is a pamphlet with a cartoon of the world. On one end, Koizumi defensively holds up the Kyoto Protocol. On the other, a fiendish-looking Bush seizes a weeping globe in his monster-size hands. In the eyes of Japan and many US allies, the Bush administration\'s decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is one of many signals that Washington is growing increasingly unilateralist in the six months since the Sept. 11 attacks on America. From pulling out of Kyoto - which is in the process of being ratified by the European Union - to labeling Iran, Iraq, and North Korea an ""axis of evil"" and prime targets in the next phase of the war, America\'s allies are seeing in the US a growing tendency to act first and consult later. The Bush administration is offering its own alternative plan, the Clear Skies and Global Climate Change Initiatives, which aides say are more market-sensitive and will reduce the worst air pollutants by 70 percent while finding a strategy to cut greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years. But environmental advocates say Bush\'s alternative will allow the US to continue to increase the amount of gas it emits. They fear that, because the US is forging its own way, smaller nations that are expected to ratify the Kyoto Protocol could start backing out. This could lead to a two-tier system in which the US and a few others - Australia and Canada may follow suit - will choose their own targets, while the rest of the world will be limited to the stricter Kyoto limits. Not everyone in Japan is upset with Bush\'s alternative. Japanese industry has already gone through vigorous energy-saving - and thus environmentally friendly - drives after the two energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s, says Mitsuru Shinozaki, a spokesman for Keidanren, the country\'s most influential business lobby. After the Earth Summit of 10 years ago, he says, Japan discussed and implemented a self-action plan to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. ""Any further policy to reduce emissions,"" he says ""will hurt Japanese industrial competitiveness.""']"
14,allsides_gun_control_and_gun_rights_c_5,[5],[3],[4],[4],[4],5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"['SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (Reuters) - The former U.S. serviceman who committed the deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 as he faced court-martial on domestic violence charges for which he was later convicted, a police report revealed on Tuesday. The report also disclosed that police who were alerted to Devin Kelley’s escape were advised that he posed a “danger to himself and others” after being “caught sneaking firearms” onto the U.S. Air Force base in New Mexico where he was stationed. The person who reported the escape, according to the report, further warned that Kelley, then aged 21, had been “attempting to carry out death threats” against his military commanders and “suffered from mental disorders.” He was apprehended without incident at an El Paso, Texas, bus station shortly after he had run off, according to a police report filed in that city. Kelley’s troubled Air Force background has been a focus of investigators in the tiny Texas town of Sutherland Springs since he stormed into a church there on Sunday with a semi-automatic assault rifle and opened fire on worshipers. Authorities have said 26 people were killed in the assault, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who was among the dead. Another 20 people were wounded, half of them still listed in critical condition as of Tuesday. Officials said Kelley, 26, killed himself during a failed getaway attempt after he was wounded by an armed civilian who tried to stop him. Two handguns belonging to the killer also were recovered. A major sporting goods dealer in San Antonio later confirmed that Kelley twice passed a required criminal background check when he bought guns there during the past year, despite having a criminal record that should have prevented those purchases. Kelley was found guilty by court-martial in 2012 of assaulting his first wife and a stepson while serving at Holloman Air Force Base, where he was assigned to a logistics readiness unit, the Pentagon reported on Monday. But the Air Force also acknowledged it inexplicably failed to enter his conviction into a government database that all licensed firearms dealers are required to use to screen prospective gun buyers for their criminal history. Federal law prohibits anyone from selling a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child. On Capitol Hill, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, called the failure to transmit Kelley’s record into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) system an “appalling” lapse. The Air Force has opened an inquiry into the matter, and the U.S. Defense Department has requested a review by its inspector general to ensure other criminal cases have been reported correctly, Pentagon officials said. Two U.S. senators, Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, said they planned to co-sponsor legislation aimed at ensuring that anyone convicted of domestic violence, whether in civilian or military court, would be blocked from legally purchasing a gun. Firearms experts said the case involving Kelley, who spent a year in military detention before his bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, exposed a previously unnoticed weak link in the system of background checks. Crosses are seen near a vigil at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland. BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS AS STUDENT Texas public school records also showed Kelley had numerous behavior problems as a student, including nine suspensions for such issues as drugs, insubordination, profanity, skipping classes and dishonesty between sixth grade and high school graduation. His private adult life appears to have likewise been marked by turbulence. After divorcing the woman he was convicted of assaulting, Kelley remarried in 2014, but authorities have said he became embroiled in some unspecified domestic dispute with her parents that involved him sending threatening text messages to his mother-in-law. Kelley’s in-laws occasionally attended services at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs but were not there when he attacked worshipers during Sunday prayers, authorities said. “We have some indication of what the conflict was between the family,” Freeman Martin, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told a Tuesday news conference. It was not clear what role, if any, the dispute played as a motivating factor in Sunday’s violence. Kelley’s cell phone was sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s crime lab at Quantico, Virginia, but specialists were not immediately able to gain electronic access to the device, said Christopher Combs, the FBI’s special agent in charge in San Antonio. The massacre, which ranked as the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in Texas history, and one of the five most lethal ever in the United States, rekindled an ongoing debate over gun ownership, which is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Guns are part of the fabric of life in rural areas. U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters he believed stricter reviews of gun purchases would not have stopped Sunday’s rampage. “There would have been no difference,” Trump said during a visit to South Korea. He added that stricter gun laws might have prevented the man who shot Kelley from acting as he did. “You would have had hundreds more dead.”']"
