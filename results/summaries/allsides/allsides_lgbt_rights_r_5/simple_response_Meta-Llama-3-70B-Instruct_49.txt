SUMMARY:

President Obama has expressed deep disappointment over Uganda's plans to further criminalize homosexuality, warning that it would "complicate our valued relationship" with the country. He stated that the proposed bill would be a "step backward" for all Ugandans, reflecting poorly on the country's commitment to human rights and representing a serious setback for those who value freedom, justice, and equal rights. The bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," has alarmed rights activists and enjoys broad support among Christian clerics and lawmakers who claim it is needed to deter Western homosexuals from "recruiting" Ugandan children. The US, Uganda's largest donor, may review its relationship with the country if the bill is signed into law. Obama has consistently defended gay rights, making it a hallmark of his presidency, and has spoken out against similar discriminatory laws in other countries.
