Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama warning Uganda about their plans to criminalize homosexuality. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

First, Obama is expressing concern over Uganda's new bill, saying it will complicate the US-Uganda relationship. He's a defender of gay rights both domestically and internationally. The bill, which President Museveni is set to sign, is seen as a step backward for Uganda's human rights commitment. It's also a setback for freedom and equal rights globally.

The article mentions that Uganda already has colonial-era laws against homosexuality, but this new bill is more severe, prescribing life imprisonment for certain acts. These include HIV-positive individuals having sex, minors, disabled individuals, or repeated consensual acts. Museveni is under pressure from Christian leaders who support the bill, thinking it deters Western homosexuals from recruiting Ugandan children.

Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, spoke to Museveni and urged him not to sign the bill. The US is Uganda's largest donor, so there might be consequences if the bill is enacted. Uganda isn't the only African country with anti-gay laws; Nigeria recently increased penalties too.

Obama has been a strong supporter of gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and lifting the ban on gays in the military. He's included gay athletes in significant events, like the State of the Union and the Sochi Olympics.

So, the summary needs to capture Obama's warning, the bill's details, Uganda's stance, the potential impact on their relationship with the US, and Obama's support for gay rights both in the US and globally.

I should structure the summary to include key points: Obama's warning, the bill's content, the impact on Uganda's human rights, the US's reaction, the funding aspect, and Obama's broader support for gay rights. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

I think I've got all the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include each of these elements without going into too much detail.
