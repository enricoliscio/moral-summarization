Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about President Obama's stance on Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Bill. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed.

First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the context. The main points are Obama's warning to Uganda, the bill's implications, Uganda's human rights commitment, the setback for freedom and equal rights, the U.S. support for fundamental freedoms, the disappointment in Uganda's decision, the bill's impact on the relationship, the harsh penalties, the support from Christian groups, the U.S. aid, and Obama's support for gay rights.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative moral connotation. Let me go through the article again and pick out these words.

"Warned" – implies concern for moral action. "Criminalize" – negative, against rights. "Gay rights" – positive, human rights. "Step backward" – negative, regression. "Human rights" – positive, fundamental. "Freedom" – positive. "Justice" – positive. "Equal rights" – positive. "Disappointed" – negative emotion. "Affront" – negative, insult. "Danger" – negative consequence. "Complicate" – negative impact on relationship. "Pressure" – negative, forcing action. "Discrimination" – negative. "Ban" – negative restriction. "Progress" – positive. "Propaganda" – negative, misleading. "Prominent" – positive, notable.

I think I've covered all the morally charged words. Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these words as possible. The summary should highlight Obama's disapproval, the bill's harsh penalties, the impact on Uganda's relationship with the U.S., and the broader context of human rights and equality.

I'll structure the summary by first stating Obama's warning, then the bill's details, the implications for Uganda's human rights commitment, the setback for global equality, the U.S.'s stance, the potential consequences for their relationship, and conclude with Obama's support for gay rights globally.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy. Also, I should preserve the moral framing by using the identified words where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure it's concise and hits all the main points while incorporating the moral language.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama strongly condemned Uganda's plans to criminalize homosexuality, stating it would harm Uganda's commitment to human rights and complicate the U.S.-Uganda relationship. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which President Museveni plans to sign, would impose harsh penalties, including life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," and mark a step backward for equality and justice. Obama emphasized the U.S. stands for fundamental freedoms and equal rights, expressing deep disappointment in Uganda's decision. The bill, supported by Christian groups, has drawn international criticism, with the U.S. urging Museveni to reconsider. Uganda, a major recipient of U.S. aid, faces potential repercussions if the bill is enacted. Obama has been a vocal advocate for gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discriminatory laws globally. The bill highlights ongoing challenges for LGBTQ+ rights in sub-Saharan Africa.
