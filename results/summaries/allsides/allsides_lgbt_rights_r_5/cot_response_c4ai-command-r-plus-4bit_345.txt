END OF STEP 1

SUMMARY: Obama issued a warning and a statement defending homosexuals' human rights, noting that the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda would be a step backward for Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people. Obama stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. The President believes that enacting this legislation would complicate the valued relationship between the United States and Uganda. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda under colonial-era laws, and Museveni has pledged to sign a new bill that would further criminalize homosexuality, which has alarmed human rights activists around the world. The United States has conveyed its disappointment and urged Museveni not to sign the bill, but it is unclear if these efforts will be successful. Obama has made support for gay rights a hallmark of his presidency and has taken steps to promote equality both domestically and internationally. END OF SUMMARY.
