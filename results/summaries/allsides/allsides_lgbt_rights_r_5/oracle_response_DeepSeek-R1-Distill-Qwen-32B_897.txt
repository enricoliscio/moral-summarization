Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about President Obama warning Uganda about criminalizing homosexuality. He mentions it complicates their relationship. He's defending gay rights, which is a moral stance. The article uses words like criminalize, complicate, defending, backward, commitment, protect, setback, committed, stands, protection, treated, enact, legislation, law, affront, danger, protecting, enacting, criminalizes, offenses, deter, recruiting, discrimination, increased, penalties, support, supports, progress.

I should start by noting Obama's warning to Uganda. He's concerned about the bill criminalizing homosexuality, which he sees as a step backward. He's defending human rights and equal treatment. The bill would complicate their relationship. Uganda's new law includes harsh penalties, which is a moral issue. He mentions the US stands for protection of freedoms and human rights, so this bill is a setback. The US is Uganda's main donor, so there might be consequences. The article also mentions other countries like Nigeria increasing penalties, and Obama's support for gay rights, including same-sex marriage and military service. He included gay athletes in his events, highlighting progress.

I need to make sure to include as many of those moral words as possible. Let me structure the summary: Start with Obama warning Uganda, the bill's impact on their relationship, his stance on human rights, the harsh penalties, the setback, the US's position, and mention other related actions like Nigeria and Obama's support for equality and progress.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me make sure each key point is covered with the moral terms. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. I'll start with the main points and ensure the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that enacting legislation criminalizing homosexuality would complicate their valued relationship and mark a step backward for human rights. He defended the protection of fundamental freedoms and equal treatment, calling the bill a serious setback for freedom, justice, and equal rights. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which includes harsh penalties like life imprisonment, would not only be an affront to the gay community but also reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting human rights. Obama emphasized that the U.S. stands for universal human rights and is deeply disappointed in Uganda's decision. The bill, which enjoys broad support among Christian leaders, aims to deter Western homosexuals from "recruiting" Ugandan children. The U.S., Uganda's largest donor, may review its relationship with the country if the bill is enacted. Obama has consistently supported gay rights, including same-sex marriage and the inclusion of openly gay individuals in significant events, highlighting progress in equality. END OF SUMMARY.
