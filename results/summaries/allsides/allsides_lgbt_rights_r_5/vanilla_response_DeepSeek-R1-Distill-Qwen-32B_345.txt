Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's warning to Uganda over their plan to criminalize homosexuality further. The article is pretty detailed, so I'll start by identifying the main points.

First, Obama is concerned because Uganda is planning to pass a bill that would make homosexuality even more illegal, which he sees as a step backward for human rights. He mentions that this will complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. The bill, called the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, prescribes life imprisonment for certain acts, which is really harsh. Uganda already has colonial-era laws against homosexuality, but this new bill is even more severe.

Next, the article talks about the support for this bill in Uganda. It's popular among Christian leaders and lawmakers who think it's necessary to prevent Western homosexuals from recruiting Ugandan children. That's a common argument in some parts of Africa against homosexuality, so I should note that.

Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, tried to convince Museveni not to sign the bill. The US is a major donor to Uganda, so there's a lot at stake financially. If Museveni signs the bill, the US might review its relationship with Uganda, possibly leading to aid cuts or other diplomatic actions.

Obama has been a strong supporter of gay rights, both in the US and internationally. He supports same-sex marriage, lifted the ban on openly gay people in the military, and includes gay athletes in significant events, like the Olympics. He also opposes Russia's anti-gay laws. So, his stance here is consistent with his broader policies.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these points without getting too bogged down in details. I'll structure it by first stating Obama's warning, then the content of the bill, the support for it in Uganda, the US's potential reaction, and Obama's broader stance on gay rights.

I should also mention that Uganda is part of a trend in sub-Saharan Africa where homosexuality is severely punished, and that other countries like Nigeria are doing similar things. That adds context about the regional situation.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with Obama's warning, the bill's details, Uganda's reasons, the US's response, and then Obama's support for gay rights both domestically and internationally. I need to keep each sentence clear and to the point to stay within the word limit.

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: President Obama has warned Uganda that its plan to further criminalize homosexuality will harm the bilateral relationship between the two nations. He criticized the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which President Yoweri Museveni intends to sign, calling it a "step backward" for human rights and a setback for global freedom and equality. The bill, passed by Ugandan lawmakers in December, prescribes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," including acts involving HIV infection, minors, the disabled, or repeat offenses. Obama emphasized the U.S. commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, urging Uganda to reconsider the legislation. The bill has drawn international condemnation, with U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice urging Museveni not to sign it. The U.S., Uganda's largest donor, may review its relationship with the country if the bill is enacted. Obama has consistently supported gay rights, both domestically and internationally, including supporting same-sex marriage and lifting the ban on openly gay military service. END OF SUMMARY.
