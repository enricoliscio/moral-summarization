Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama warning Uganda about criminalizing homosexuality. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the main event is Obama's statement against Uganda's plan to pass the Anti-Homosexuality Bill. He mentions that it will complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. He's standing up for gay rights globally, similar to his stance in the US.

The article says the bill, which President Museveni is planning to sign, is a step backward for Uganda and reflects poorly on their commitment to human rights. It also affects the global fight for freedom and equal rights. Obama emphasizes that the US stands for protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, so he's disappointed that Uganda is moving in this direction.

The bill in Uganda already criminalizes homosexuality under colonial laws, but this new bill would make it worse with life imprisonment for certain acts. Museveni is under pressure from Christian groups who support the bill to prevent Western influence. Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, tried to convince Museveni not to sign it.

The US is Uganda's biggest donor, so there might be consequences if the bill is signed. Uganda isn't alone in this; other African countries like Nigeria have also increased penalties against gays. Obama has been a strong supporter of gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and ending the ban on openly gay military service. He's also highlighted the importance of visibility for LGBTQ+ individuals in sports and politics.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the key points: Obama's warning, the impact on Uganda-US relations, the bill's harsh penalties, Museveni's stance, the US's position on human rights, and Obama's broader support for gay rights.

Let me structure it: Start with Obama's warning and its effect on relations. Mention the bill's penalties and Museveni's support. Note the US's concern and possible consequences. Conclude with Obama's advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights globally.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all main points without getting too detailed. Also, keep the language clear and concise.
