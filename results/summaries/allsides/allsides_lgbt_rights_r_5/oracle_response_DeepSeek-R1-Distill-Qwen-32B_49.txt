Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is warning Uganda about their plan to further criminalize homosexuality. He's concerned this will complicate the relationship between the two countries. The article mentions that Obama supports gay rights both domestically and internationally. 

I notice the author uses words like "criminalize," "complicate," "defending," and "backward," which are morally charged. I should make sure to include these in the summary. The article also talks about Uganda's new bill, which would lead to life imprisonment for certain homosexual acts. This is a serious issue because it goes against human rights and equal treatment.

Obama emphasizes that the U.S. stands for protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, so enacting this law would be a setback. The summary should highlight the moral implications, such as the danger to the gay community and the broader impact on Uganda's commitment to human rights. I also need to mention the U.S.'s potential response, like reviewing their relationship and aid.

I should structure the summary to start with Obama's warning, then discuss the bill's content, the moral opposition, and the potential consequences for the U.S.-Uganda relationship. I'll make sure to include the key morally framed words without making the summary too long, keeping it under 200 words.

Let me draft it: Obama warns Uganda about criminalizing homosexuality, calling it a step backward and complicating their relationship. He defends gay rights, stating the U.S. stands for equal treatment and human rights. The bill would lead to harsh penalties, affecting not just gays but Uganda's international standing. The U.S. is disappointed and may review their aid, as they support freedom and justice globally. This should cover the main points while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama warned Uganda about its plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating it would complicate the U.S.-Uganda relationship and mark a step backward for human rights. He defended gay rights globally, emphasizing the U.S. commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and equal treatment. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni plans to sign, would criminalize homosexuality and impose life imprisonment for certain acts, including those involving HIV infection, minors, or consenting adults. Obama called the legislation an affront to the gay community and a serious setback for freedom, justice, and equal rights. The U.S. stands against such laws, as they reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to human rights and could strain their relationship. The bill, already passed by Ugandan lawmakers, has faced international criticism, with the U.S. urging Museveni not to enact it. Obama's stance aligns with his support for gay rights, including same-sex marriage and ending the ban on openly gay military service. END OF SUMMARY.
