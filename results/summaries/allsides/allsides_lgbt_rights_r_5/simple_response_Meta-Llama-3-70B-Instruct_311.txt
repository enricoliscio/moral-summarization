SUMMARY:

President Obama has warned Uganda that its plans to further criminalize homosexuality would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed law, which prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," would reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting human rights and freedom. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. He expressed deep disappointment over the bill, which would not only harm the gay community in Uganda but also represent a serious setback for those committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights worldwide. The US has conveyed its concerns to President Museveni, and a review of its relationship with Uganda is expected if the bill is signed.

END OF SUMMARY.
