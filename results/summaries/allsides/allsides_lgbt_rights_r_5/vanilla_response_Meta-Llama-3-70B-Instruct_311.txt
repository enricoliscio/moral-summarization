SUMMARY:

President Obama has warned Uganda over its plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would "complicate our valued relationship" with the country. Obama expressed deep disappointment over the proposed legislation, which would mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to human rights. The bill, which has been pledged to be signed by President Yoweri Museveni, would criminalize homosexuality with life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality" acts. The US has conveyed its concerns to Museveni, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice has urged him not to sign the bill. The US is Uganda's largest donor, and a review of the relationship is expected if the bill is signed. Obama has been a strong defender of gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and eliminating the ban on openly gay service in the military.
