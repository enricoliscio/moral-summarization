Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

President Obama is warning Uganda about their plan to criminalize homosexuality further. He's saying it'll complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. He's a big supporter of gay rights both domestically and internationally. The bill, which President Museveni is about to sign, is seen as a step backward for Uganda and a setback for human rights and equality.

I should highlight Obama's stance on human rights and equality. The article mentions that the bill would lead to life imprisonment for certain acts, which is alarming. It's important to note the pressure from Christian groups supporting the bill, thinking it's needed to stop Western influence.

Also, the US is a major donor to Uganda, so the potential consequences of the bill on their relationship are significant. Obama's disappointment is clear, and he's taking a moral stand against discrimination.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect, emphasizing human rights, equality, and the negative impact of the bill. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and structured with the key points: Obama's warning, the bill's content, the moral stance, and the potential consequences.

SUMMARY: President Obama has condemned Uganda's plan to criminalize homosexuality further, calling it a "step backward" for human rights and a setback for equality. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which President Yoweri Museveni is set to sign, prescribes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," including acts involving HIV infection, minors, or consenting adults. Obama emphasized the U.S. commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, expressing deep disappointment in Uganda's decision, which he said would harm the bilateral relationship. The bill, supported by Christian groups, aims to deter Western influence but has drawn international criticism. The U.S., Uganda's largest donor, may review its aid relationship if the bill is enacted. Obama has consistently supported gay rights, including same-sex marriage and ending the military's ban on openly gay service members. END OF SUMMARY.
