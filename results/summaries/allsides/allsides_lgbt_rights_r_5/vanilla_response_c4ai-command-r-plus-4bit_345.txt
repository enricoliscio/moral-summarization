SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that their plans to criminalize homosexuality would negatively impact their relationship with the United States. Obama defended gay rights, stating that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda would reflect poorly on the country's commitment to protecting human rights and would be a setback for those who support freedom, justice, and equal rights. The bill, which is expected to be signed by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, would impose life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality." Obama emphasized the US's commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and stated that enacting the legislation would complicate the valued relationship between Uganda and the US. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda, and the new bill has been supported by Christian clerics and lawmakers who believe it will deter Western homosexuals from recruiting Ugandan children. National Security Adviser Susan Rice also urged Museveni not to sign the bill. The US is Uganda's largest donor, and a review of the relationship between the two countries is expected if the bill is signed. Obama has made supporting gay rights a key part of his presidency, both domestically and internationally. END OF SUMMARY.
