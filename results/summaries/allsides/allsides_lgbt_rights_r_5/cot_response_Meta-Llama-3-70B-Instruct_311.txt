SUMMARY:
President Obama warned Uganda that its plans to further criminalize homosexuality would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed law, which would prescribe life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," is a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized that the United States stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. He expressed deep disappointment over the legislation, which would be an affront and a danger to the gay community in Uganda. The US has conveyed its concerns to President Museveni, and may review its relationship with Uganda if the bill is signed. Obama has been a strong defender of gay rights, and this move is seen as a step backward for progress made in this area. END OF SUMMARY.
