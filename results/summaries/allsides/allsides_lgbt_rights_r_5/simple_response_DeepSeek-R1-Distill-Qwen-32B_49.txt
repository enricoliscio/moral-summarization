Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's response to Uganda's plan to criminalize homosexuality further. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Obama is warning Uganda that their new bill will harm their relationship with the US. He's emphasizing the importance of human rights and equal treatment. The bill would lead to life imprisonment for certain homosexual acts, which is a big concern.

I should highlight Obama's stance on global gay rights and how this bill goes against the values the US stands for. Also, mention the impact on Uganda's relationship with the US, especially since the US is a major donor. Including the consequences if the bill is signed, like reviewing the relationship, is important.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it captures the moral aspects, like the setback for human rights and the disappointment from the US. I'll structure it to start with Obama's warning, then the implications, and end with the broader context of Obama's support for gay rights.

Let me make sure I include all the essential points without getting too detailed. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise.

SUMMARY: President Obama has condemned Uganda's plan to criminalize homosexuality further, warning that it would harm the bilateral relationship between the two nations. He criticized the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which President Yoweri Museveni is set to sign, as a "step backward" for Uganda and a setback for global commitments to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, expressing deep disappointment over the legislation, which would criminalize homosexuality and impose life imprisonment for certain acts. The bill, passed by Ugandan lawmakers in December, has faced international condemnation, particularly for its harsh penalties and its impact on the LGBTQ+ community. Obama's statement reflects his administration's support for gay rights, both domestically and globally, and underscores the moral and human rights implications of the law. The U.S., as Uganda's largest donor, may reassess its relationship with the country if the bill is enacted. END OF SUMMARY.
