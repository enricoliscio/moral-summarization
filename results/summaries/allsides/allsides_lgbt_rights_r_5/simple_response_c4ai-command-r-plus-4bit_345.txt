SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that its plans to further criminalize homosexuality will negatively impact their relationship with the United States. Obama defended gay rights, stating that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda is not only a danger to the gay community but also a step backward for all Ugandans and a reflection of the country's lack of commitment to protecting human rights. The bill, which has alarmed rights activists, prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," and is seen as a way to deter Western homosexuals from "recruiting" Ugandan children. Obama's support for gay rights is well-known, and he has made it a hallmark of his presidency, both domestically and internationally. He believes in equal treatment for all people, regardless of sexual orientation. Obama's statement sends a strong message to Uganda and other countries that discriminate against homosexuals, and it remains to be seen what actions the US will take if Uganda's President Museveni signs the bill into law. END OF SUMMARY.
