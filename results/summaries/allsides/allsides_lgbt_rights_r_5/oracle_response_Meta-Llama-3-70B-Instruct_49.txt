SUMMARY:

President Obama warned Uganda that its plans to further criminalize homosexuality would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans, reflecting poorly on the country's commitment to protecting human rights. The proposed legislation, which includes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," would be an "affront and a danger" to the gay community and a "serious setback" for those committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama, who has made defending gay rights a hallmark of his presidency, emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. He urged President Museveni not to sign the bill, which would represent a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. The US, Uganda's largest donor, may review its relationship with the country if the bill is enacted.
