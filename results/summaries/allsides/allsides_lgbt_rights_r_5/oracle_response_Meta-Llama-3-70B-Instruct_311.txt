SUMMARY:

President Obama has warned Uganda against plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which would impose life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," would be a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. He expressed deep disappointment that Uganda would enact legislation that would criminalize homosexuality, which would be an affront and a danger to the gay community. The US has conveyed its concerns to President Museveni, and a review of the relationship between the two countries is likely if the bill is signed. Obama has consistently defended gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and eliminating the ban on openly gay service in the military.
