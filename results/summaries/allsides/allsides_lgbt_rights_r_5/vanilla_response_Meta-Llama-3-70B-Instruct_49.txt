SUMMARY:

President Obama has expressed his disappointment and concern over Uganda's plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would "complicate our valued relationship" with the country. The proposed bill, which President Yoweri Museveni has pledged to sign, would mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to protecting human rights. The bill prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," including sex acts with minors, the disabled, or those infected with HIV. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. The US has conveyed its concerns to Museveni, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice has urged him not to sign the bill. The US is Uganda's largest donor, and a review of its relationship with the country may be necessary if the bill is signed.
