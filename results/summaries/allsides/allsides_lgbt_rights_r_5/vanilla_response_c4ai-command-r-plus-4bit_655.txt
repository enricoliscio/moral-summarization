SUMMARY: President Obama issued a statement warning Uganda against its plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would negatively impact their relationship with the United States. Obama defended gay rights and stated that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda would reflect poorly on the country's commitment to protecting human rights. The bill, which has been pledged to be signed by President Yoweri Museveni, prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality." Obama emphasized the United States' commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, believing that people should be treated equally. National Security Advisor Susan Rice also urged Museveni not to sign the bill, highlighting the significant aid the United States provides to Uganda annually. The situation in Uganda reflects a broader issue of discrimination and criminalization of homosexuality in sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria recently increasing penalties against gays. Obama's support for gay rights has been a key aspect of his presidency, including the repeal of the ban on openly gay service in the military. He has also spoken out against Russia's anti-gay propaganda law.
