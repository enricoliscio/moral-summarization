SUMMARY:

President Obama has warned Uganda against its plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would "complicate our valued relationship" between the two countries. Obama believes the proposed law, which includes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," would be a "step backward" for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to human rights. The US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and Obama has conveyed his concerns to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The US is Uganda's largest donor, providing over $400 million in aid annually, and may review its relationship with the country if the bill is signed. Obama has been a strong supporter of gay rights, defending them around the world and at home, and has spoken out against similar laws in other countries.
