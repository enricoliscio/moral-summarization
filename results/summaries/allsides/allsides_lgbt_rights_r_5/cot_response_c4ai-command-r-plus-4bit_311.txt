SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda about its plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would complicate their relationship. He defended gay rights, saying that the bill Uganda plans to enact will be a danger to the gay community and a step backward for all Ugandans. Obama expressed his deep disappointment and urged Ugandan President Museveni not to sign the bill, stating that it will reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its citizens. The bill has also alarmed human rights activists as it prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality." Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda and this bill would increase discrimination and penalties against the gay community. Obama has made support for gay rights a hallmark of his presidency and believes in equal rights and fundamental freedoms for all. He eliminated the ban on openly gay service in the military and has spoken out against gay propaganda laws in other countries. The US has conveyed its stance on this issue and the potential impact on US-Uganda relations. Obama's commitment to freedom, justice, and equal rights for all is clear, and he has shown support for gay athletes and progress in sports. END OF SUMMARY.
