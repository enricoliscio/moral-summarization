Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is warning Uganda about their plan to criminalize homosexuality, which he sees as a step backward and a setback for human rights. He emphasizes the U.S.'s commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and equal rights. Uganda's new bill would complicate their relationship with the U.S., and it's already illegal there under colonial law. The bill includes harsh penalties, and there's pressure from Christian groups. The U.S. is Uganda's largest donor, so there might be consequences if the bill is enacted.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list provided. Words like criminalize, complicate, defending, backward, commitment, protect, setback, committed, stands, protection, treated, enact, legislation, law, affront, danger, protecting, enacting, criminalizes, offenses, deter, recruiting, discrimination, increased, penalties, support, supports, progress.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with Obama warning Uganda about criminalizing homosexuality, which complicates their relationship. Mention his defense of gay rights and the bill as a step backward. Highlight Uganda's commitment to human rights and the setback for freedom and justice. Include the U.S.'s stance on protecting rights and equal treatment. Note the legislation's impact on the gay community and its broader implications. Mention the penalties and the pressure from Christian groups. Finally, touch on the potential consequences for the U.S.-Uganda relationship and Obama's support for gay rights globally.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral framing provided.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama warned Uganda that enacting legislation to criminalize homosexuality would complicate their valued relationship and mark a step backward for human rights. He defended gay rights globally, stating that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill reflects poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people and represents a serious setback for freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized that the U.S. stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and believes everyone should be treated equally. The bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," has alarmed rights activists and enjoys broad support among Christian clerics in Uganda. Obama expressed deep disappointment and noted that enacting this legislation would harm Uganda's relationship with the U.S., which is its largest donor. The bill, already illegal under colonial-era law, has faced heavy pressure from international advocates. Obama's stance aligns with his support for gay rights, including same-sex marriage and ending the ban on openly gay military service. END OF SUMMARY.
