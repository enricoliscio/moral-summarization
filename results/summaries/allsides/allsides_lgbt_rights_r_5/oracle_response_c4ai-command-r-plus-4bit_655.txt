SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that their plans to criminalize homosexuality would complicate US-Uganda relations. Obama defended gay rights, saying that the bill would be a step backward for Ugandans and reflect poorly on their commitment to protect human rights. The bill, which would enact harsh penalties for homosexuality, has been criticized by rights activists and is expected to be signed into law by President Yoweri Museveni. The US has conveyed its disappointment to Museveni and may review its relationship with Uganda if the bill becomes law. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda and the new legislation would increase penalties, including life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality." Obama's support for gay rights is well-known and he has made progress on this issue a hallmark of his presidency. Obama's stance on this issue reflects his commitment to freedom, justice, and equal rights for all. END OF SUMMARY.
