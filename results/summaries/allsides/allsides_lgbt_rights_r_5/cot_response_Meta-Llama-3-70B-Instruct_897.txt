SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed deep disappointment over Uganda's plans to further criminalize homosexuality, warning that it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," would reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people and represent a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized that the United States stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. The US has conveyed its concerns to President Museveni, and a review of its relationship with Uganda is expected if the bill is signed. END OF SUMMARY.
