Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama warning Uganda about their anti-homosexuality bill. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that Obama warned Uganda over their plans to further criminalize homosexuality. He mentioned that this would complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. He's defending gay rights globally, just like he does in the US. The bill, which President Museveni is planning to sign, is seen as a step backward for Uganda and reflects poorly on their commitment to human rights. Obama also says it's a setback for freedom, justice, and equal rights.

He emphasizes that the US stands for protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, treating everyone equally. He's disappointed that Uganda is about to pass this legislation, calling it an affront to the gay community and a step backward for all Ugandans. The bill would complicate their valued relationship. The US has communicated this to Museveni.

The article explains that homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda under colonial-era laws. The new bill would impose life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," which includes acts where one partner has HIV, sex with minors or disabled individuals, or repeated consensual sexual offenses. Museveni hasn't signed it yet but is under pressure from Christian clerics and lawmakers who support it, saying it's needed to stop Western homosexuals from recruiting Ugandan children.

Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, spoke to Museveni and urged him not to sign the bill. The US is Uganda's largest donor, giving over $400 million annually. If the bill is signed, the US will review its relationship with Uganda, possibly reducing aid. Uganda is among several African countries where homosexuals face severe discrimination or jail. Nigeria recently increased penalties against gays. Obama supports gay rights, including same-sex marriage and lifting the ban on openly gay military service. He's highlighted gay athletes in his speeches and opposed Russia's anti-gay laws.

So, the key points to include in the summary are:

1. Obama warns Uganda about the anti-homosexuality bill, saying it will complicate US-Uganda relations.
2. The bill is seen as a step backward for human rights and a setback for equal rights.
3. The US stands for protecting freedoms and human rights.
4. The bill criminalizes homosexuality further, with life imprisonment for certain acts.
5. Uganda's leaders are under pressure from Christian groups.
6. The US might reduce aid if the bill is signed.
7. Obama supports gay rights globally and has highlighted this in his presidency.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should make sure to include the main actions, consequences, and the stance of both Obama and Uganda. Also, mention the potential impact on US aid and Uganda's existing laws.

I should structure it to first state Obama's warning, then the bill's details, the implications, and the US's response. Make sure to mention that the US is Uganda's largest donor and that aid might be affected. Also, include that this bill is part of a trend in some African countries and Obama's support for gay rights.

I need to be concise but cover all these points without going over the word limit. Let me try to draft it now, keeping each sentence focused on a single point.
