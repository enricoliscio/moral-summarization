SUMMARY:

President Obama has expressed deep disappointment over Uganda's plans to further criminalize homosexuality, warning that it would "complicate our valued relationship" with the country. He stated that the bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," would be a "step backward" for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to human rights. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. He urged Ugandan President Museveni not to sign the bill, which has broad support among Christian clerics and lawmakers who claim it is needed to deter Western homosexuals from "recruiting" Ugandan children. The US, Uganda's largest donor, is expected to review its relationship with the country if the bill is signed. Obama has been a vocal supporter of gay rights, defending them around the world and at home.
