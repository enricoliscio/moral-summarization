SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that their plans to further criminalize homosexuality will negatively impact their relationship with the United States. Obama stated that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda would not only be a danger to the gay community but also a setback for all Ugandans and anyone committed to equal rights. The bill, which is expected to be signed by President Yoweri Museveni, would make homosexuality a criminal offense with life imprisonment as a possible punishment. Obama defended gay rights and emphasized the US's commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights for all. The US has conveyed their disappointment to Museveni and may review their relationship with Uganda if the bill becomes law. Uganda is a major recipient of US aid, and the US has been a strong supporter of gay rights both domestically and internationally. Obama's support for gay rights has been evident throughout his presidency, including his defense of gay athletes and opposition to Russia's anti-gay propaganda law. END OF SUMMARY.
