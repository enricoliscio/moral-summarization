SUMMARY: President Obama has warned Uganda about its plans to criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would negatively impact their relationship with the United States. Obama defended gay rights, saying that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda would be a step backward for Ugandans and reflect poorly on their commitment to human rights. The bill, which would make homosexuality punishable by life imprisonment, has been criticized by human rights activists and is expected to be signed into law by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. Obama emphasized the US's commitment to freedom, justice, and equal rights for all, and stated that enacting the legislation would complicate the relationship between the two countries. The US has conveyed this message to Museveni and may review their aid relationship with Uganda if the bill is signed. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda, and the new bill has been supported by Christian clerics and lawmakers who believe it will deter Western homosexuals from recruiting Ugandan children. Obama's support for gay rights has been a hallmark of his presidency, and he has taken various steps to promote equality for the LGBT community both domestically and internationally. END OF SUMMARY.
