SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda over its plans to criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would be a "step backward" and complicate the valued relationship between the two countries. Obama defended gay rights, emphasizing the commitment to human rights, freedom, justice, and equal rights. He highlighted that enacting such legislation would be an affront and a danger to the gay community, reflecting poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people. The US, as Uganda's largest donor, conveyed its disappointment and urged Uganda not to proceed with the bill. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda, and the new legislation would prescribe life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality." The US has made clear its stance against discrimination and for gay rights, with Obama supporting same-sex marriage and lifting the ban on openly gay service in the military. Obama's support for gay rights has been a hallmark of his presidency, and he has taken various steps to promote progress and equality. Uganda's plan to criminalize homosexuality has been met with alarm by activists and criticism from the US, which values its relationship with Uganda but stands firm on its commitment to human rights and equal treatment. END OF SUMMARY.
