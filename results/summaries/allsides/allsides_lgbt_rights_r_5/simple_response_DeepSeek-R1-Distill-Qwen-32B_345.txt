Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama warning Uganda over their anti-homosexuality bill. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the ethical and human rights aspects.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Obama is criticizing Uganda for passing this bill, which criminalizes homosexuality more severely. He mentions it's a step backward and affects Uganda's relationship with the US. The bill includes harsh penalties like life imprisonment for certain acts. Uganda's support for the bill is based on Christian beliefs and a fear of Western influence.

I should highlight Obama's stance on human rights and equality. He's emphasizing the US's commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms. Also, note that Uganda is a major recipient of US aid, so there might be consequences if the bill is signed.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll condense each point without losing the moral elements. Make sure to include Obama's disappointment, the bill's impact, and the potential repercussions on Uganda-US relations. Also, mention the broader context of anti-gay laws in Africa and Obama's support for gay rights globally.

Let me structure this: start with Obama's warning, the bill's details, the moral implications, Uganda's reasons, the potential consequences, and Obama's broader stance on gay rights. Keep it concise but comprehensive.

SUMMARY: President Obama has criticized Uganda's planned anti-homosexuality bill, calling it a "step backward" for human rights and a setback for global commitments to freedom and equality. The bill, which President Yoweri Museveni has pledged to sign, would criminalize homosexuality and impose harsh penalties, including life imprisonment for certain acts. Obama emphasized the U.S. commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, expressing disappointment that Uganda would enact such legislation. He warned that the bill would complicate the bilateral relationship, as the U.S. is Uganda's largest donor. The bill, which passed in December, has faced international condemnation but enjoys broad support among Ugandan Christian leaders and lawmakers, who view it as a defense against Western influence. Obama's stance reflects his administration's broader support for LGBTQ+ rights, including advocating against similar laws globally. END OF SUMMARY.
