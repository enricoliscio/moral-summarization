SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that their plans to criminalize homosexuality would complicate US-Uganda relationships. Obama defended gay rights, saying that the bill would be a step backward for Ugandans and reflect poorly on their commitment to protect human rights. The bill would also be a setback for those committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized the US commitment to the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, believing that people should be treated equally. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda, once law, will endanger the gay community and complicate the valued relationship between the US and Uganda. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda, and the new legislation would prescribe life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality." The US has conveyed their disappointment to Uganda's President Museveni, and if the bill is signed, the US will review its relationship with Uganda. Obama has made support for gay rights a hallmark of his presidency and has taken actions to support gay rights both domestically and internationally. Obama's stance against the criminalization of homosexuality reflects his commitment to justice, equal rights, and freedom from discrimination for all individuals. END OF SUMMARY.
