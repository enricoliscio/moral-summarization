SUMMARY:

President Obama has warned Uganda against plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating that it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed law, which would impose life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," has alarmed rights activists and would reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to human rights. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. The US has conveyed its concerns to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has pledged to sign the bill. The US is Uganda's largest donor, and may review its relationship with the country if the bill is signed. Obama has been a strong defender of gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and speaking out against anti-gay laws in other countries.
