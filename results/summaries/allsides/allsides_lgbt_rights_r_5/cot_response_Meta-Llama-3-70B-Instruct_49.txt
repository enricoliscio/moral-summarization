SUMMARY:
President Obama warned Uganda's President Museveni that signing the Anti-Homosexuality Bill would be a "step backward" for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people. The bill, which criminalizes homosexuality, would also mark a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama expressed deep disappointment, stating that the legislation would be an affront and a danger to the gay community in Uganda. The US, which stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, has conveyed its concerns to Museveni. The bill's enactment would complicate the valued relationship between the US and Uganda, with the US likely to review its aid to the country. Obama has been a strong defender of gay rights, making it a hallmark of his presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
