Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used. 

The article is about President Obama criticizing Uganda's plan to criminalize homosexuality further. He mentions that this will complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. The moral terms here include words like "criminalize," "gay rights," "human rights," "freedom," "justice," "equal rights," "protection," "affront," "danger," "step backward," "commitment," "setback," "fundamental freedoms," "universal human rights," "disappointed," "illegal," "life imprisonment," "discrimination," "jail terms," "progress," and "banning."

Next, I need to create a summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and clearly convey Obama's stance against the bill, the implications for Uganda's relationship with the US, and the broader context of gay rights both in Uganda and globally.

I should structure the summary to first state Obama's warning, then explain the bill's details, mention the consequences for Uganda, and note the support from Christian groups. I'll also include the US's position, the financial aid aspect, and the broader context of Obama's support for gay rights. Finally, I'll conclude with the potential impact on Uganda's relationship with the US.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I should maintain the moral framing by using the identified words to emphasize the ethical concerns involved.

**SUMMARY:**

President Obama criticized Uganda's plan to criminalize homosexuality, warning it would harm the bilateral relationship. He condemned the Anti-Homosexuality Bill as a "step backward" for Uganda, violating human rights and undermining commitments to freedom, justice, and equality. The bill, which includes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," has drawn international condemnation. Obama emphasized the U.S. commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, expressing deep disappointment in Uganda's decision. The bill, supported by Christian groups, aims to deter Western homosexuals from recruiting Ugandan children. The U.S., Uganda's largest donor, may review its aid relationship if the bill is enacted. Obama has been a vocal advocate for gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and ending the ban on openly gay military service. The bill reflects a broader trend of discrimination against homosexuals in sub-Saharan Africa. END OF SUMMARY.
