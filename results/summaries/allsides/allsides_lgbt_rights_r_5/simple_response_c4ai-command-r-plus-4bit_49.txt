SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that their plans to criminalize homosexuality would complicate their relationship with the United States. Obama defended gay rights, stating that the bill would be a setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. He emphasized the importance of protecting fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and that people everywhere should be treated equally. The bill, which has alarmed rights activists, prescribes life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality," reflecting poorly on Uganda's commitment to human rights. Obama's stance on this issue aligns with his broader support for gay rights during his presidency, such as his support for same-sex marriage and the elimination of the ban on openly gay service in the military. The United States, as Uganda's largest donor, may review its relationship with the country if the bill is signed into law. This situation underscores the ongoing struggle for gay rights in many sub-Saharan African countries. END OF SUMMARY.
