SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that its plans to further criminalize homosexuality would complicate US-Uganda relations. Defending gay rights, Obama stated that the bill would reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protect human rights and would be a setback for those who support freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized the US's stand for the protection of fundamental freedoms and equal treatment of all people. The bill, once law, will not only be a danger to the gay community in Uganda but also a step backward for all Ugandans. It will complicate the valued relationship between the US and Uganda, as conveyed by Obama and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda, and the new legislation would prescribe life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," including sex with minors or the disabled. The US has been Uganda's largest donor, but if Museveni signs the bill, the US is expected to review its relationship and register its disappointment. Obama has made support for gay rights a hallmark of his presidency and has spoken out against discrimination and for equal rights, both domestically and internationally. END OF SUMMARY.
