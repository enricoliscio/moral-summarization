SUMMARY:
President Obama warned Uganda over its plans to further criminalize homosexuality, saying it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed bill, which would criminalize homosexuality, is a "serious setback" for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama expressed his deep disappointment, stating that the bill would be an "affront" and a "danger" to the gay community in Uganda. He emphasized that the United States stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. The U.S. has conveyed its concerns to President Museveni, and is expected to review its relationship with Uganda if the bill is signed. Obama has been a strong defender of gay rights, and has made it a hallmark of his presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
