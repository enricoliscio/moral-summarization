SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed deep disappointment over Uganda's plans to further criminalize homosexuality, warning that it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed law, which prescribes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," would reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people and represent a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized that the United States stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, believing that people everywhere should be treated equally. The U.S. has conveyed its disappointment to President Museveni, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice urged him not to sign the bill. If enacted, the law would be a serious affront to the gay community in Uganda and a danger to those who share a commitment to freedom, justice, and equal rights. END OF SUMMARY.
