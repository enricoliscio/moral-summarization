SUMMARY:

President Obama has expressed deep disappointment over Uganda's plans to further criminalize homosexuality, warning that it would "complicate our valued relationship" with the country. He believes the bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for certain acts, would be a "step backward" for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on the country's commitment to human rights. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and that people everywhere should be treated equally. He urged President Museveni not to sign the bill, which would mark a serious setback for freedom, justice, and equal rights. The US, Uganda's largest donor, may review its relationship with the country if the bill is signed. Obama has been a strong defender of gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and eliminating the ban on openly gay service in the military.
