SUMMARY:

President Obama warned Uganda against plans to further criminalize homosexuality, stating it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. The proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," would reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting human rights and represent a serious setback for freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. He expressed deep disappointment over the bill, which would be an affront and danger to the gay community in Uganda. The US has conveyed its concerns to President Museveni, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice urged him not to sign the bill. The US is expected to review its relationship with Uganda if the bill is enacted, potentially leading to a setback in their valued relationship. Obama has consistently defended gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and eliminating the ban on openly gay service in the military.
