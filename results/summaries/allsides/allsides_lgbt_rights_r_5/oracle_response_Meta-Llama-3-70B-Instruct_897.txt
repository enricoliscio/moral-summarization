SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that its plans to further criminalize homosexuality would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans, reflecting poorly on the country's commitment to protecting human rights. The proposed legislation, which would impose life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," is a serious setback for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. Obama emphasized that the US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, believing that people everywhere should be treated equally. He expressed deep disappointment that Uganda would enact legislation that would criminalize homosexuality, which would be an affront and a danger to the gay community. The US has conveyed its concerns to President Museveni, and if the bill is signed, the US will review its relationship with Uganda. Obama has consistently defended gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and eliminating the ban on openly gay service in the military. END OF SUMMARY.
