Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them step by step.

First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. The user provided an example with words like "warned," "criminalize," "complicate," etc. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. These are words that indicate approval or disapproval, right or wrong, etc.

Looking at the article, I see words like "warned," "criminalize," "complicate," "valued," "defending," "rights," "pledged," "step backward," "commitment," "protect," "human rights," "freedom," "justice," "equal rights," "disappointed," "affront," "danger," "protecting," "affront," "setback," "share," "urged," "discrimination," "severe," "jail terms," "support," "recruiting," "disappointment," "progress," "included," "moment," "banning," "propaganda," "delegations," "ceremonies."

I think these words carry the moral weight in the article. They reflect the stance on human rights, justice, equality, etc.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Obama condemns Uganda's bill, it's a step backward, affects human rights, complicates US-Uganda relationship, Uganda's existing laws, the new bill's harsh penalties, US's role as a donor, Obama's support for gay rights, examples of his support, and the broader context of discrimination in Africa.

Now, I'll try to weave in the moral words naturally into the summary. I'll make sure to include terms like "warned," "criminalize," "complicate," "commitment," "human rights," "freedom," "justice," "equal rights," "disappointed," "setback," etc.

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it and then check the word count.

Wait, the example summary was 179 words, so I need to be concise. Maybe I can combine some sentences to save space while keeping the moral framing intact.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**

President Obama condemned Uganda's plan to criminalize homosexuality, stating it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for human rights. He emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to freedom, justice, and equal rights, expressing disappointment over the bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality." Uganda's existing colonial-era law already criminalizes same-sex acts, and the new legislation, supported by Christian leaders, aims to deter Western influence. The U.S., Uganda's largest donor, has urged President Museveni not to sign the bill, warning it would reflect poorly on Uganda's human rights commitment and complicate their relationship. Obama has consistently supported gay rights, including same-sex marriage and ending the military's ban on openly gay service members. The bill's passage would represent a serious setback for global equality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
