SUMMARY: President Obama issued a warning to Uganda over its plans to criminalize homosexuality, defending the universal human rights of its people. Obama stated that enacting this legislation would be a wrong step backward for Ugandans, complicating their valued relationship with the United States. He emphasized the commitment to freedom, justice, and equal rights, which are fundamental freedoms that everyone deserves. Obama expressed deep disappointment in the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which would not only be an affront and danger to the gay community but also reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of all its citizens. This legislation will seriously setback anyone who shares a commitment to these universal rights. The United States has urged Museveni not to sign the bill, conveying the message that their relationship will be complicated. Uganda already faces scrutiny for its severe discrimination against homosexuals, and the US has indicated a review and registering of disappointment if the bill becomes law. Obama has made support for gay rights a hallmark of his presidency, eliminating bans on openly gay service and celebrating progress. He has also spoken out against propaganda and supported gay athletes. END OF SUMMARY.
