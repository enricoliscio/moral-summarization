Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Obama warning Uganda about a bill that criminalizes homosexuality. He mentions it would complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. He's defending gay rights globally, similar to what he's done in the US. The bill, which President Museveni plans to sign, is seen as a step backward for Uganda and a setback for human rights, freedom, justice, and equal rights.

Obama emphasizes that the US stands for protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, treating everyone equally. He's disappointed that Uganda is enacting this legislation, which not only affects the gay community but also reflects poorly on Uganda's commitment to human rights. The bill includes harsh penalties like life imprisonment for certain acts, which has alarmed rights activists.

Museveni is under pressure, and the US, being Uganda's largest donor, might review its relationship if the bill is signed. The article also mentions Obama's support for gay rights in the US, like same-sex marriage and lifting the ban on openly gay military service. He's included gay athletes in significant events, showing his commitment to equality.

So, the key points are:
- Obama's warning to Uganda about the anti-gay bill.
- The bill's impact on Uganda's relationship with the US.
- Moral stance on human rights, freedom, and equality.
- The harsh penalties in the bill.
- Uganda's support for the bill among Christian groups.
- The US's potential response, including reviewing aid.
- Obama's broader support for gay rights in the US and globally.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, ensuring the moral framing is clear. I should mention Obama's disappointment, the implications for Uganda's international standing, the penalties, and the US's possible response. Also, include the broader context of Obama's support for gay rights.

I should structure it to first state Obama's warning, then the implications, the bill's details, the international response, and conclude with the broader significance of Obama's stance.

Let me draft this, making sure it's concise and within the word limit.
