Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Obama criticizing Uganda's plan to further criminalize homosexuality. He's expressing disappointment and warning that this will complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. He mentions that this bill is a step backward for Uganda and reflects poorly on their commitment to human rights. He's emphasizing the protection of fundamental freedoms and equal rights, which is a key moral stance.

I notice the author uses words like "criminalize," "complicate," "defending," "backward," "commitment," "protect," "setback," "committed," "stands," "protection," "treated," "enact," "legislation," "law," "affront," "danger," "protecting," "enacting," "criminalizes," "offenses," "deter," "recruiting," "discrimination," "increased," "penalties," "support," "supports," "progress." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

So, the summary should mention Obama's warning, the impact on their relationship, the bill's effect on human rights, the US's stance on equal rights, and the potential consequences if Uganda enacts the law. Also, include the Christian support in Uganda and the US's financial leverage.

I should structure it to flow logically: Obama's statement, the bill's details, Uganda's support for the bill, the US's possible reaction, and the broader context of Obama's support for gay rights.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key moral points.

SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that enacting legislation criminalizing homosexuality would complicate the US-Uganda relationship and mark a step backward for human rights. He emphasized the US's commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and equal rights, expressing deep disappointment over Uganda's decision. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which includes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," would be an affront to the gay community and a serious setback for global progress toward freedom and justice. Obama highlighted Uganda's failure to protect human rights and its impact on the country's international standing. The bill, supported by Christian clerics, aims to deter Western homosexuals from recruiting Ugandan children. The US, Uganda's largest donor, has urged President Museveni not to sign the bill and may review its relationship with Uganda if he does. Obama has consistently defended gay rights, supporting same-sex marriage and military service, and has criticized similar laws globally. END OF SUMMARY.
