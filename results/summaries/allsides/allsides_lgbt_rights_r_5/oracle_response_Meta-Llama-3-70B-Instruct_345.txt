SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda over its plans to further criminalize homosexuality, saying it would "complicate our valued relationship" and mark a "step backward" for all Ugandans. Obama defended gay rights, emphasizing that the bill would reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting human rights and treating people equally. He stated that enacting this legislation would be a "serious setback" for those committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. The bill, which prescribes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," has alarmed rights activists and would be an "affront and a danger" to the gay community in Uganda. Obama urged Uganda to protect the human rights of its people, and the US has conveyed its disappointment to President Museveni. The US stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and believes people everywhere should be treated equally. END OF SUMMARY.
