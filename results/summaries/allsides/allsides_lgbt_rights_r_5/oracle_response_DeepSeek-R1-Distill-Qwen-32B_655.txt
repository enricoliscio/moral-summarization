Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article is about President Obama warning Uganda about their plans to further criminalize homosexuality. He mentions that this will complicate the relationship between the US and Uganda. He's defending gay rights both internationally and domestically. The bill, which President Museveni is set to sign, is seen as a step backward for Uganda and a setback for human rights and equal rights. Obama emphasizes that the US stands for protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights, and he's disappointed that Uganda is moving in this direction. The bill would not only affect the gay community but also reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to human rights. It's described as an affront and a danger. The legislation prescribes life imprisonment for certain acts, which has caused alarm among rights activists. Uganda is a major recipient of US aid, so the US is considering reviewing their relationship if the bill is enacted. The article also mentions Obama's support for gay rights, including same-sex marriage and ending the ban on openly gay military service.

Now, the author used specific morally framed words like criminalize, complicate, defending, backward, commitment, protect, setback, committed, stands, protection, treated, enact, legislation, law, affront, danger, protecting, enacting, criminalizes, offenses, deter, recruiting, discrimination, increased, penalties, support, supports, progress.

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise, under 200 words. I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's warning, the implications of the bill, the moral stance against it, and the potential consequences for Uganda's relationship with the US.

I'll start by stating Obama's warning and the impact on their relationship. Then, mention the bill's details and its moral implications. Include the US's stance on human rights and freedoms. Note the disappointment and the potential consequences. Finally, tie in Obama's broader support for gay rights and the implications of the bill on progress.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring I incorporate the moral language and keep it within the word limit.
