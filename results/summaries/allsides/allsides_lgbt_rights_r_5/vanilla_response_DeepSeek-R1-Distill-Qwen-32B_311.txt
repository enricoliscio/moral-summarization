Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about President Obama warning Uganda about their anti-homosexuality bill. They specified that the summary should be under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the key points. The main points are Obama's warning, the bill's details, Uganda's stance, the impact on their relationship, and the broader context of gay rights.

I should include Obama's disappointment, the bill's harsh penalties, Uganda's support for the bill, the potential consequences from the U.S., and mention Obama's support for gay rights both domestically and internationally.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, captures all essential information, and stays within the word limit. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

Let me structure the summary: start with Obama's warning, mention the bill's penalties, Uganda's position, the U.S. reaction, and conclude with Obama's stance on gay rights globally.

I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Also, make sure to include that the U.S. is Uganda's largest donor and the possible review of their relationship if the bill is signed.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning Obama's broader support for LGBTQ rights, tying it back to his administration's policies and international stance.

SUMMARY: President Obama criticized Uganda's plan to further criminalize homosexuality, warning it would harm the bilateral relationship. He described the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which President Yoweri Museveni plans to sign, as a "step backward" for Uganda and a setback for global freedom and equality. The bill, passed by Ugandan lawmakers in December, imposes life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality," including sex acts involving HIV infection, minors, or the disabled. Obama emphasized the U.S. commitment to protecting human rights and equality, urging Uganda to reconsider the legislation. The U.S., Uganda's largest donor, may review its aid relationship if the bill is enacted. Obama has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights, supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discriminatory laws globally. END OF SUMMARY.
