Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama warning Uganda about their anti-homosexuality bill. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the moral implications and the stance Obama is taking.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is criticizing Uganda's decision to criminalize homosexuality further, which he sees as a step backward for human rights. He mentions the bill would complicate the US-Uganda relationship. The bill includes harsh penalties like life imprisonment for certain homosexual acts, which has drawn criticism from rights activists.

I should highlight Obama's commitment to equal rights and how this bill goes against that. Also, the article mentions the US's financial support for Uganda, so that's a point about the potential consequences if the bill is signed.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral stance. I'll structure it by stating Obama's warning, the specifics of the bill, the implications for Uganda's relationship with the US, and Obama's broader support for gay rights.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all key points without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: President Obama has condemned Uganda's planned anti-homosexuality bill, calling it a "step backward" for human rights and a setback for freedom and equality. He emphasized the U.S. commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and urged Uganda to reconsider the legislation, which would criminalize homosexuality and impose harsh penalties, including life imprisonment for "aggravated homosexuality." Obama warned that enacting the bill would strain Uganda's relationship with the U.S., a major donor. The bill, which passed in December, has faced criticism from rights activists and international leaders, including Obama, who has championed gay rights both domestically and globally. The U.S. has pressured Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to reject the bill, highlighting its moral and human rights implications. END OF SUMMARY.
