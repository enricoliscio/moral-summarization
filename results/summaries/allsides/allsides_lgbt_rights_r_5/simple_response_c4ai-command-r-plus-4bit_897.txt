SUMMARY: President Obama warns Uganda that their plans to criminalize homosexuality will negatively impact their relationship with the United States. Obama defends gay rights and states that the bill will reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting human rights and will be a setback for freedom, justice, and equal rights. The bill, which criminalizes sex acts "against the order of nature," has been heavily criticized by rights activists and will impose life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality." Obama emphasizes the US's commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms and equal rights for all people, and expresses deep disappointment in Uganda's decision. Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, also urged Uganda's President Museveni not to sign the bill. The US is Uganda's largest donor, and a review of their relationship is expected if the bill is signed. Obama has made support for gay rights a key part of his presidency and has taken a stand against discrimination and for equality. END OF SUMMARY.
