SUMMARY: President Obama warned Uganda that their plans to further criminalize homosexuality would complicate US relations with the country and represent a step backward for all Ugandans and for anyone committed to freedom, justice, and equal rights. In a written statement, Obama defended gay rights, saying that the United States stands for the protection of fundamental freedoms and universal human rights, and that people everywhere should be treated equally. He expressed deep disappointment in Uganda's plans to enact legislation that would criminalize homosexuality, calling it an affront and a danger to the gay community and a setback for those committed to protecting human rights. Obama also mentioned that enacting this legislation would complicate the valued relationship between the United States and Uganda. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda under a colonial-era law, and the new bill, which has been pledged to be signed by President Yoweri Museveni, would prescribe life imprisonment for acts of "aggravated homosexuality." The US has conveyed their message to Museveni and is expected to review its relationship with Uganda if the bill is signed. Obama has made support for gay rights a hallmark of his presidency and has taken steps to support gay rights both domestically and internationally. END OF SUMMARY.
