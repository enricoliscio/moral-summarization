SUMMARY:

The article criticizes President Trump's decision to consider moving the Republican National Convention to another state, citing his selfish and reckless behavior during the pandemic. Trump's actions are seen as a desperate attempt to shift blame to a Democratic governor, or to create a fight with a popular governor in a swing state. The article argues that Trump is willing to put his supporters' lives at risk for the sake of "optics" and to feed his own ego. Former Vice President Joe Biden is quoted, blasting Trump for his selfish and dangerous behavior, and accusing him of "stoking death" by refusing to wear a mask and insisting on holding a large convention during a pandemic. The article concludes that Trump's behavior is morally reprehensible, lacking empathy and responsibility, and is characteristic of a schoolyard bully who refuses to be held accountable.
