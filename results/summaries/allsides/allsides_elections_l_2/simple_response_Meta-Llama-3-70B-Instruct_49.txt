SUMMARY:

The article criticizes President Trump's decision to consider moving the Republican National Convention to a different state, citing his selfish and reckless behavior. The author suggests that Trump's motives may be to shift blame to a Democratic governor or to create a fight with a political opponent. However, this decision would put thousands of people at risk of contracting COVID-19, including his own supporters. The article labels Trump's actions as "morally reprehensible" and "false bravado," accusing him of being willing to endanger lives for the sake of "optics." Former Vice President Joe Biden is quoted, blasting Trump for his selfish behavior and accusing him of "stoking death." The article concludes that Trump's conduct is that of a schoolyard bully, lacking empathy, coherence, and responsible adulthood. His actions will likely lead to an election thrashing.
