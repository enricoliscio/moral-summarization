Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. The summary should be under 200 words and placed between "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump wanting to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic, which the author sees as morally wrong. The author criticizes Trump for his self-absorbed behavior, putting people at risk, and not caring about the consequences. Biden is mentioned as criticizing Trump's actions.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list that are used in the article. Words like "backfired," "offering," "wanted," "create," "pull," "set," "insult," "willing," "infected," "die," "comprehend," "behavior," "costs," "costing," "engage," "stoking," "death," "refusal," "insistence," "bringing," "lacking," "creating," "pounding," "conduct," "refuses."

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's actions and the moral implications. Start by stating Trump's intent, then the consequences, Biden's criticism, and the overall moral judgment.

I'll make sure to include words like "backfired," "offering," "create," "pull," "set," "insult," "willing," "infected," "die," "comprehend," "behavior," "costs," "stoking," "death," "refusal," "insistence," "bringing," "lacking," "creating," "pounding," "conduct," "refuses."

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with Trump's initial intent, the backfiring, the Republican governors' offers, the potential insult to North Carolinians and others, Trump's willingness to endanger supporters, the cost in lives, Biden's criticism, and the overall assessment of Trump's conduct as morally wrong.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure the morally framed words are naturally integrated into the summary.

Let me draft it:

SUMMARY: The article critiques Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention amidst the pandemic, highlighting his self-absorbed behavior and disregard for public health. Trump's intent to shift blame or create conflict backfired, as Republican governors offered to host the event, despite the risks. His refusal to wear masks and insistence on holding the convention could set up a pandemic hotspot, potentially insulting North Carolinians and others. Trump is willing to risk infecting supporters, even causing deaths, without comprehending the political and moral repercussions. Biden condemned Trump's behavior, calling it selfish and dangerous, emphasizing that real leadership requires empathy and responsibility. Trump's actions, lacking coherence and empathy, resemble those of a schoolyard bully, stoking death and endangering the vulnerable. His refusal to lead responsibly and insistence on risky conventions highlight his morally reprehensible conduct, which could cost him the election. END OF SUMMARY.

I think this captures the moral framing effectively while using as many of the specified words as possible without exceeding the word limit.
