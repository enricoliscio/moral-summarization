Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the text. 

First, I need to understand the article. It's about Trump's decision to hold a convention during the pandemic, which is criticized for being reckless and self-absorbed. The author uses strong moral language to condemn Trump's actions.

For step one, I have to find all the single words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "reckless," "self-absorbed," "reprehensible," "selfish," "dangerous," "folly," "missing a step," "empathy," "coherence," "false bravado," "bully," and "thrashing." These words are all used to convey negative moral assessments.

Next, I need to summarize the article. I should keep the moral framing intact, so I'll include those words where appropriate. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main points: Trump's decision, the criticism from Biden, and the moral implications.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key points without getting too bogged down in details. It's important to highlight Trump's self-interest and the negative consequences, as well as Biden's criticism.

I should structure the summary to start with Trump's actions, then move to the criticism, and end with the implications for the election. This way, the moral framing is clear and the summary is coherent.

Let me put it all together, making sure to include the morally charged words and keep it within the word limit. I'll start by stating Trump's decision, then mention the criticism from Biden, and conclude with the impact on the election. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the moral tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article critiques President Trump's decision to hold a Republican convention during the pandemic, framing it as reckless and self-absorbed. Trump's actions are described as morally reprehensible, as he prioritizes political optics over public health, potentially endangering his supporters and others. Critics argue his behavior disregards the well-being of vulnerable populations and sets a dangerous precedent. Former Vice President Joe Biden condemns Trump's recklessness, calling it "macho stuff" that costs lives and lacks leadership. Biden accuses Trump of "stoking death" and highlights his lack of empathy and coherence. The article portrays Trump as a schoolyard bully, engaging in false bravado and creating unnecessary conflicts, which could lead to a political thrashing in the election. His refusal to wear a mask and insistence on holding the convention are seen as selfish and reckless, further alienating voters and undermining his campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
