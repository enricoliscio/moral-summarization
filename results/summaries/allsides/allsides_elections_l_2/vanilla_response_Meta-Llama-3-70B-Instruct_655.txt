SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's decision to potentially move the Republican National Convention from North Carolina due to disagreements with Democratic Governor Roy Cooper over COVID-19 safety measures. The author suggests that Trump's motivations may be to shift blame to the governor or to create a fight with a Democratic opponent. However, this move could backfire and insult both North Carolinians and residents of the new host state. The article also quotes former Vice President Joe Biden, who criticized Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a large convention during the pandemic, calling it "selfish" and "dangerous" behavior. Biden argued that Trump's actions are "stoking death" and that real leaders prioritize the safety of others over their own vanity. The article concludes that Trump's behavior is reckless, selfish, and morally reprehensible.

END OF SUMMARY.
