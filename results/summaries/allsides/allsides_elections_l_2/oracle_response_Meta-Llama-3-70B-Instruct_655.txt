SUMMARY:

The article critiques Trump's decision to potentially move the Republican convention from North Carolina, suggesting it may be a ploy to shift blame to the Democratic governor or create a fight. However, this plan has backfired, with multiple Republican governors offering to host the convention, which would put thousands of people at risk of infection. The author argues that Trump is willing to have his supporters infected and possibly die just to achieve the "optics" of a convention, showcasing his selfish and reckless behavior. This is morally reprehensible and bad politics, as it would insult both North Carolinians and residents of the new state. The article praises Joe Biden's criticism of Trump's refusal to wear a mask, calling it "stoking death" and accusing Trump of lacking empathy and responsible adulthood. Trump's conduct is likened to a schoolyard bully, refusing to be held responsible for his actions.
