SUMMARY:
Trump's recent behavior has raised concerns about his moral character and has been deemed reckless by many. His decision to start a fight with a Democratic governor, potentially putting his supporters at risk of infection and death, is considered frightful and morally reprehensible. The author argues that Trump's actions stem from selfishness and a lack of empathy, endangering others and putting the vulnerable at risk. Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a convention during a pandemic have been criticized as false bravado and folly. Biden accused Trump of stoking death and being falsely masculine, highlighting the president's lack of responsibility and empathy. Trump's behavior, characterized by creating fights and bullying, is seen as a sign of his moral decline and could lead to an election thrashing. The author also mentions the reckless behavior of Republican governors who are willing to host the convention, disregarding the potential health risks and costs associated with large gatherings during a pandemic. This situation reflects Trump's selfish and irresponsible leadership style, which could have dangerous consequences.
