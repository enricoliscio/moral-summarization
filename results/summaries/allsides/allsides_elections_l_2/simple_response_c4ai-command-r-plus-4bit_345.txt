SUMMARY: Trump's reckless and selfish behavior regarding the Republican convention and his refusal to wear a mask during the pandemic showcase his self-absorption and lack of empathy. His willingness to endanger his supporters and insult residents of North Carolina and other states demonstrates his disregard for human life and the well-being of others. Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Trump's actions as "false masculinity" that is costing people's lives. Biden's comments highlight the moral reprehensibility of Trump's conduct, which is akin to that of a schoolyard bully. Trump's actions, including his insensitive treatment of the parents of a deceased daughter, indicate a lack of responsibility and coherence. His behavior is likely to lead to an election thrashing as millions of Americans recognize his reckless and selfish actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
