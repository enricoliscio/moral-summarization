Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about Trump wanting to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic. The author suggests that Trump's motives might be to shift blame onto the Democratic governor of North Carolina, Cooper, but that backfired because Republican governors are now offering to host the convention, which is risky. The author also mentions that Trump might want to create a fight with a Democratic governor, especially since Cooper is popular and North Carolina is a swing state.

The article criticizes Trump for being self-absorbed and reckless, putting his supporters at risk just for the optics of a convention. It's pointed out that this could be bad politics and morally wrong. The author also quotes Biden criticizing Trump's behavior regarding masks and the convention, calling it dangerous and selfish. Biden accuses Trump of stoking death and questions Trump's empathy and coherence, comparing him to a schoolyard bully.

So, the summary needs to capture these points: Trump's decision to hold the convention despite the pandemic, the possible motives, the criticism for recklessness and selfishness, Biden's response, and the moral judgment against Trump.

I should structure the summary to first state Trump's action, then the possible reasons, followed by the criticism from Biden, and conclude with the moral assessment. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the moral framing elements like recklessness, selfishness, and the comparison to a bully.

Let me try to put that together clearly and succinctly.
