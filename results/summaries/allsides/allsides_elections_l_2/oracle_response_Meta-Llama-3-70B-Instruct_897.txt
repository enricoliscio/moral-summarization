SUMMARY:

The article criticizes President Trump's decision to consider moving the Republican National Convention from North Carolina, citing his selfish and reckless behavior. Trump's intent may have been to shift blame to the Democratic governor or create a fight, but it backfired, and now multiple Republican governors are offering to host the convention, disregarding the pandemic risks. The author argues that Trump is willing to put his supporters' lives at risk for the "optics" of a convention, demonstrating a lack of empathy and responsible adulthood. This behavior is morally reprehensible, as it would cost lives and create a pandemic hot spot. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump's refusal to wear a mask, calling it "macho stuff" that "costs people's lives." Biden accused Trump of "stoking death" and lacking qualities like empathy and coherence. The article concludes that Trump's conduct is that of a schoolyard bully who refuses to be held responsible for his actions, and his behavior will likely lead to an election thrashing.
