Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump wanting to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic, and the author's moral critique of his actions. The article mentions that Trump might be trying to shift blame or create conflict, which backfired. Governors are offering to host, but this could insult people and endanger lives. The author uses words like backfired, offering, pull, set, insult, willing, infected, die, comprehend, behavior, costs, costing, engage, stoking, death, refusal, insistence, bringing, lacking, creating, pounding, conduct, refuses.

I need to structure the summary to include these words. Start with Trump's intent, the backfired attempt, governors offering, the insult to both states, willingness to endanger supporters, Biden's criticism, and the moral implications.

I'll make sure each sentence includes some of the key moral words. For example, "Trump wanted to create a fight" uses "wanted" and "create." Mention the governors offering, the insult, willingness to have supporters infected, Biden's points on behavior and costs, and the overall assessment of Trump's conduct as lacking empathy and coherence.

I'll keep the summary concise, around 200 words, ensuring all important points are covered with the moral language intact. Finally, I'll end with the summary token as instructed.

SUMMARY: The article critiques President Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention during the pandemic, highlighting his morally questionable actions. Trump may have wanted to shift blame to a Democratic governor or create conflict, but this backfired as Republican governors are now offering to host the event, despite the risks. His willingness to endanger thousands, including his own supporters, to create the "optics" of a convention is seen as reckless and self-absorbed. The author argues that Trump lacks empathy and coherence, prioritizing his own image over public safety. Biden condemns Trump's behavior, pointing out that it costs lives and undermines leadership. Trump's refusal to wear a mask and insistence on holding the convention are doubly dangerous, stoking death and endangering vulnerable populations. His conduct reflects a lack of responsibility, akin to a schoolyard bully, and his actions are likely to backfire politically, leading to an election thrashing. END OF SUMMARY.
