SUMMARY:

The article criticizes Trump's decision to move the Republican convention, suggesting it's a selfish and reckless move to shift blame to a Democratic governor or to create a fight. Trump's insistence on holding a large convention despite the pandemic is morally reprehensible, putting thousands of lives at risk for his own "optics." The article quotes Joe Biden, who blasted Trump for his selfish behavior, saying it's "stoking death" and that real men don't endanger others for vanity. The article argues that Trump's conduct is that of a schoolyard bully, lacking empathy, coherence, and responsible adulthood. His actions will likely backfire, insulting both North Carolinians and residents of the new state, and providing another reason for Americans to vote him out of office.
