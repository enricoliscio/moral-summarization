Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic, and the author uses a lot of morally charged words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article starts by questioning why Trump decided to hold the convention. It suggests two possibilities: shifting blame to a Democratic governor or creating a fight with a popular one. The author criticizes Trump for being self-absorbed and reckless, not considering the consequences of holding a large gathering during a pandemic. The author uses words like "backfired," "offering," "wanted," "create," "pull," "set," "insult," "willing," "infected," "die," "comprehend," "behavior," "costs," "costing," "engage," "stoking," "death," "refusal," "insistence," "bringing," "lacking," "creating," "pounding," "conduct," "refuses."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's decision to hold the convention, then the possible reasons. Then, mention the criticism about recklessness and moral issues. Include Biden's comments about Trump's behavior. Finally, wrap it up by highlighting the implications for the election.

I should structure it so each sentence captures a main point with the moral terms. Let me piece it together, making sure not to miss any key points and keeping it within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article critically examines President Trump's decision to hold the Republican National Convention during the pandemic, highlighting its moral and political implications. The author suggests Trump's motives may include shifting blame onto Democratic Governor Roy Cooper or creating conflict with a popular, swing-state governor. Trump's insistence on proceeding with the convention, despite the risks of spreading the virus, is criticized as reckless and self-absorbed, prioritizing political optics over public health. The author uses morally charged terms like "backfired," "offering," "wanted," "create," "pull," "set," "insult," "willing," "infected," "die," "comprehend," "behavior," "costs," "costing," "engage," "stoking," "death," "refusal," "insistence," "bringing," "lacking," "creating," "pounding," "conduct," and "refuses" to emphasize Trump's disregard for the well-being of others. Former Vice President Joe Biden condemns Trump's behavior, calling it "selfish" and "dangerous," and accuses him of "stoking death." The article concludes that Trump's actions reflect a lack of empathy and responsible leadership, comparing his conduct to that of a "schoolyard bully." END OF SUMMARY.
