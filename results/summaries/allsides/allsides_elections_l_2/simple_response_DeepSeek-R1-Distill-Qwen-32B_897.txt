Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about Trump wanting to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic. It suggests two possible reasons: either he wants to shift blame to the Democratic governor of North Carolina, or he wants to create a fight with a popular governor in a swing state. The author seems critical of Trump's decision, pointing out that it's reckless and could backfire politically.

The article also mentions that Trump's behavior is seen as selfish and dangerous, not just politically but morally. Biden is quoted criticizing Trump for his refusal to wear masks and for endangering people. The author uses strong language, calling Trump's actions "morally reprehensible" and likening him to a schoolyard bully.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points: Trump's decision to hold the convention, the potential political and moral implications, Biden's criticism, and the overall negative moral judgment on Trump's actions.

I should structure the summary to first state Trump's decision, then the possible reasons, the political and moral criticism, Biden's comments, and the conclusion about Trump's behavior being reckless and self-centered.

I also need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without going over the word limit.
