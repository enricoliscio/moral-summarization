Okay, I need to summarize this article about Trump and the Republican convention. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about why Trump might have wanted to hold the convention in North Carolina, possibly to shift blame to the Democratic governor. It mentions that this backfired because Republican governors are now offering to host it, which could lead to more issues. 

The author also speculates that Trump might be trying to create a conflict with a Democratic governor, especially since Cooper is popular and North Carolina is a swing state. If Trump moves the convention, he could upset people in both states. The article criticizes Trump for being self-absorbed and not caring about the risks to his supporters, just for the optics of the convention. 

Biden is mentioned as criticizing Trump for his refusal to wear masks and his dangerous behavior. Biden calls Trump's actions "macho stuff" that's costing lives and says presidents should lead, not engage in folly. The article ends by comparing Trump's behavior to that of a schoolyard bully and suggests he's heading for an election loss.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Trump's reasons for the convention, the backfire effect, Biden's criticism, and the overall critique of Trump's leadership and behavior. I'll make sure to include the key criticisms and the implications for the election.

SUMMARY: The article discusses President Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention in North Carolina amid the pandemic, suggesting his motivations may include shifting blame to Democratic Governor Roy Cooper or creating a political conflict. Trump's insistence on proceeding despite the health risks has backfired, as Republican governors have offered to host the event, potentially creating a pandemic hotspot. The article criticizes Trump for prioritizing optics over public safety, endangering his supporters, and failing to grasp the political and moral consequences of his actions. Former Vice President Joe Biden condemned Trump's reckless behavior, calling it "macho" and dangerous, and accused him of stoking death. The article concludes by likening Trump's behavior to that of a schoolyard bully, lacking empathy and coherence, and suggests his actions could lead to a decisive election defeat. END OF SUMMARY.
