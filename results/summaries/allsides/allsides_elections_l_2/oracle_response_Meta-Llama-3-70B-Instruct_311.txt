SUMMARY:

President Trump's attempt to shift blame to a Democratic governor for not hosting the Republican convention in North Carolina has backfired, with multiple Republican governors now offering to host the event despite the pandemic risks. Trump's selfish and reckless behavior is willing to put thousands of lives at risk, including those of his closest supporters, just to get the "optics" of a convention. This morally reprehensible conduct is a stark contrast to responsible leadership, as Trump refuses to comprehend the costs of his actions, which are literally costing people's lives. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump's behavior, calling it "stoking death" and saying that real men don't endanger others for vanity. Trump's lack of empathy, coherence, and responsible adulthood is on full display as he creates fights and pounds his chest with false bravado, behaving like a schoolyard bully who refuses to take responsibility for his actions. END OF SUMMARY.
