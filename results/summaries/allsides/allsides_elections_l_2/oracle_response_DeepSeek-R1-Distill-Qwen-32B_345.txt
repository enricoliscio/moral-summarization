Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic, highlighting the moral implications. It suggests that Trump either wanted to shift blame or create a conflict with a Democratic governor. The author criticizes Trump for being self-absorbed and reckless, endangering people's lives. Biden is portrayed as criticizing Trump's behavior, emphasizing leadership and empathy.

I should identify the key moral words from the list that are used in the article. Words like "backfired," "insist," "cost," "endanger," "reckless," "selfish," "stoking," "refusal," "insistence," "lacking," "create," "pounding," "conduct," and "refuses" are central to the moral framing.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring the moral critique is clear. I'll mention Trump's intent, the negative consequences, Biden's criticism, and the overall moral failure. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally.

I should start by stating Trump's intent, then the potential backfiring, mention the governors offering conventions, the costs, and the endangerment. Then, include Biden's points about leadership and Trump's refusal to wear masks, stoking death, and the lack of empathy. Conclude with the characterization of Trump's conduct as that of a bully.

I need to ensure that the summary captures the essence of the article while embedding the moral language effectively. Let me piece it together step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without making it too verbose.
