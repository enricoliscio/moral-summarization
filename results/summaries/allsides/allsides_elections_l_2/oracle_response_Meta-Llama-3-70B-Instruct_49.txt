SUMMARY:

President Trump's attempt to shift blame to a Democratic governor for not hosting the Republican convention in North Carolina has backfired. Instead, multiple Republican governors are now offering to host the convention, disregarding the pandemic risks. Trump's willingness to create a fight with a Democratic governor and pull the convention to another state, despite the danger and costs, is morally reprehensible. He is willing to have his closest supporters infected and possibly die just to get the "optics" of a convention. This selfish and reckless behavior is stoking death and costing people's lives. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on bringing a pandemic-spreading crowd to the convention, calling it "false bravado" and "conduct of a schoolyard bully." Trump's behavior lacks empathy, coherence, and responsible adulthood, and is likely to lead to an election thrashing.

END OF SUMMARY.
