SUMMARY: Trump's decision to move the Republican convention to another state, despite the ongoing pandemic, has sparked criticism and concerns. The author suggests that Trump's motivation may have been to shift blame to a Democratic governor or create a fight with one, but his actions have backfired as multiple Republican governors have offered to host the convention, potentially creating a pandemic hotspot. Trump's insistence on holding a convention with crowds of thousands, many refusing to wear masks, demonstrates a disregard for public health and safety. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, criticized Trump for his selfish and dangerous behavior, accusing him of "stoking death." The author argues that Trump's actions display a lack of empathy and coherence, and his bullying behavior will likely lead to an election loss.

END OF SUMMARY.
