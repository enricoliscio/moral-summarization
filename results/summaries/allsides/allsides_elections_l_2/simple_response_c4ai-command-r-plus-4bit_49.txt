SUMMARY: Trump's reckless and selfish behavior regarding the Republican convention and his refusal to wear a mask during the pandemic showcase his self-absorption and lack of empathy. His willingness to endanger his supporters and insult residents of North Carolina and other states demonstrates his disregard for human life and well-being. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, rightfully blasts Trump for his dangerous behavior, false masculinity, and folly. Trump's actions, from creating fights to bullying, reflect those of a schoolyard bully and someone heading for an election loss. His lack of moral comprehension and responsible adulthood should be a wake-up call for Americans to boot him from office.

END OF SUMMARY.
