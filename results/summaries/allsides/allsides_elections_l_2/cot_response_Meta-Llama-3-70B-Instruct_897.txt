SUMMARY:
President Trump's decision to move the Republican convention from North Carolina is seen as a selfish and reckless move, disregarding the safety of thousands of people who would attend the event. Trump's intent may have been to shift blame to the Democratic governor or to create a fight, but it has backfired, with multiple Republican governors offering to host the convention. Trump's behavior is morally reprehensible, putting his own interests above the lives of others. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump's selfish and dangerous behavior, saying it's "stoking death" and that real men don't endanger others because of vanity. Trump's conduct is likened to that of a schoolyard bully, refusing to take responsibility for his actions. His false bravado and lack of empathy will likely lead to an election thrashing. END OF SUMMARY.
