SUMMARY:
President Trump's decision to pull the Republican convention from North Carolina has been criticized as a selfish and reckless move. His intent may have been to shift blame to the Democratic governor or to create a fight, but it has backfired. Trump's insistence on holding a convention with thousands of attendees, many of whom refuse to wear masks, is morally reprehensible and puts lives at risk. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump's behavior as selfish, dangerous, and falsely masculine, accusing him of "stoking death." Trump's lack of empathy, coherence, and responsible leadership has led to a display of false bravado, reminiscent of a schoolyard bully. His actions will likely be seen as another reason to boot him from office. END OF SUMMARY.
