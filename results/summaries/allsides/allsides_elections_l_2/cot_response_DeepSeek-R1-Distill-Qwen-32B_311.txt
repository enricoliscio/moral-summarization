Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention during a pandemic. The author uses strong moral language to criticize Trump's actions. I need to pick out words that carry a moral judgment. Words like "selfish," "reckless," "reprehensible," "folly," "stoking," "missing a step," "empathy," "coherence," "false bravado," "bully," and "thrashing" come to mind. These words highlight the moral issues the author sees in Trump's behavior.

Now, for the summary, I have to make sure it's concise but still includes these moral terms. I should mention Trump's self-absorption, the recklessness of the convention, the moral failure, and the criticism from Biden. I'll also touch on the political and moral implications, showing how Trump's actions backfire and damage his reputation.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll start by stating Trump's decision, then his motivations, the negative outcomes, Biden's criticism, and the overall impact on his presidency. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included naturally in the context.

I should double-check that each word I identified is indeed present and that the summary accurately reflects the article's moral perspective. Also, I'll keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown or formatting as per the user's request. Once done, I'll present the summary clearly after the specified tokens.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article criticizes President Trump for his decision to hold the Republican National Convention during the pandemic, highlighting his selfish and reckless behavior. The author argues that Trump's actions, such as refusing to wear masks and insisting on hosting a large crowd, are morally reprehensible and politically damaging. By ignoring public health risks, Trump risks creating a pandemic hotspot and alienating both North Carolinians and residents of the new state. Former Vice President Joe Biden condemns Trump's behavior, calling it "folly" and "stoking death," while accusing him of lacking empathy and coherence. The article portrays Trump as a schoolyard bully, engaging in false bravado and refusing responsibility, ultimately setting himself up for a political thrashing. His actions reflect a failure to lead responsibly and a disregard for the well-being of others. END OF SUMMARY.
