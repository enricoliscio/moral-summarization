SUMMARY: The article discusses President Trump's decision to move the Republican National Convention from North Carolina, citing concerns about the state's Democratic governor and the potential for a pandemic hotspot. The author suggests that Trump's motivation may have been to shift blame or create a fight with a Democratic governor, regardless of the potential consequences for the people attending the convention and the residents of the new state. The article also highlights former Vice President Joe Biden's criticism of Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a convention that could spread the pandemic, calling it "false bravado" and "reckless". Biden accused Trump of "stoking death" and lacking empathy and coherence. The author concludes that Trump's behavior is that of someone heading for an election loss.
END OF SUMMARY.
