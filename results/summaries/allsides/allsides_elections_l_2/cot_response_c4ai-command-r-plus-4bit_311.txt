SUMMARY:
The article discusses the moral implications of Trump's decision to move the Republican convention to a state with less restrictive COVID-19 measures, despite the risks of spreading the virus to thousands of attendees. The author condemns Trump's "selfish, dangerous behavior" and his disregard for the well-being of others, calling it "reprehensible" and "false bravado". The article also criticizes Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a convention that could put his supporters at risk of infection and death. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, accuses Trump of "stoking death" and lacking empathy and coherence. Biden also refutes the Trump campaign's claims of mental decline, stating that it is Trump who is "missing a step". The author concludes that Trump's behavior is that of a "schoolyard bully" who refuses to take responsibility for his actions and is heading towards an "election thrashing".
END OF SUMMARY.
