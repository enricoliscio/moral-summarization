SUMMARY:

The article criticizes President Trump's decision to potentially move the Republican National Convention from North Carolina, suggesting that he is motivated by a desire to shift blame to a Democratic governor or to create a fight with a political opponent. The author argues that Trump's actions are reckless and selfish, prioritizing his own political interests over the health and safety of thousands of people who would attend the convention. The article also quotes former Vice President Joe Biden, who blasts Trump for his refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a large convention during a pandemic, calling it "stoking death." The author concludes that Trump's behavior is morally reprehensible, lacking empathy and responsible adulthood, and is instead characterized by false bravado and a refusal to take responsibility for his actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
