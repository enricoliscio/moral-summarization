Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it should be returned after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is discussing Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic. It mentions possible reasons why Trump might have chosen to do this, like shifting blame or creating a conflict with a Democratic governor. It also talks about the potential consequences, such as creating a pandemic hotspot and the political fallout.

The article contrasts Trump's behavior with Biden's criticism, highlighting Trump's recklessness and self-absorption. Biden is portrayed as emphasizing the importance of leadership and responsibility, accusing Trump of endangering lives and lacking empathy.

I need to condense all this into a summary. I'll start by stating Trump's decision to hold the convention, the possible reasons, the political implications, and Biden's criticism. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

I should also ensure that the summary captures the essence of the article without getting bogged down in details. I'll focus on the key points: Trump's decision, possible motivations, the potential negative outcomes, and Biden's response.

Let me draft the summary now, keeping it concise and within the word limit.
