SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's decision to potentially move the Republican National Convention from North Carolina due to the state's COVID-19 restrictions. The author suggests that Trump's motivation may be to shift blame to the Democratic governor or to create a fight with him. However, this move could backfire and insult both North Carolinians and residents of the new host state. The article also quotes former Vice President Joe Biden, who criticized Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a large convention, calling it "macho stuff" that costs lives. Biden accused Trump of "stoking death" and lacking empathy and coherence. The article concludes that Trump's behavior is reckless, selfish, and morally reprehensible, and that it may ultimately lead to his downfall in the election.

END OF SUMMARY.
