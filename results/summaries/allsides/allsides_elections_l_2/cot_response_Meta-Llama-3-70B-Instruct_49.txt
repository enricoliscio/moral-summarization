SUMMARY:
President Trump's decision to move the Republican convention from North Carolina has been met with criticism, with many accusing him of being reckless and selfish. His insistence on holding a large gathering despite the pandemic has been labeled as morally reprehensible, putting thousands of lives at risk. Trump's behavior has been described as falsely masculine, stoking death and endangering others for his own vanity. In contrast, former Vice President Joe Biden has blasted Trump for his selfish and dangerous behavior, emphasizing the importance of empathy and responsible leadership. Biden's criticism highlights Trump's lack of qualities associated with responsible adulthood, instead exhibiting false bravado and schoolyard bully behavior. Trump's actions are expected to backfire, leading to an election thrashing. END OF SUMMARY.
