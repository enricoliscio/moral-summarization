SUMMARY: Trump's reckless behavior regarding the Republican convention and his refusal to wear a mask during the pandemic has caused widespread concern and criticism. His decision to create a fight with a Democratic governor and possibly shift blame to them backfired, as multiple Republican governors are now offering to host the convention, endangering thousands of people and their refusal to wear masks. Trump's selfish and dangerous behavior is costing people's lives, and his insistence on bringing a crowd to the convention is stoking death. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, blasted Trump for his lack of empathy and false masculinity, accusing him of endangering the vulnerable and tormenting the parents of a deceased daughter. Trump's behavior demonstrates a lack of comprehension of the consequences of his actions and a refusal to be held responsible, instead engaging in chest-pounding and creating fights. His conduct is morally reprehensible and could lead to an election thrashing.
END OF SUMMARY.
