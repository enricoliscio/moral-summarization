SUMMARY: Trump's reckless behavior regarding the Republican convention is endangering the lives of his supporters and the residents of North Carolina. His refusal to wear a mask and insistence on holding a convention involving thousands of people during a pandemic is selfish and dangerous. Trump seems more concerned with creating a fight with a Democratic governor and shifting blame than with the health and safety of the American people. His behavior is morally reprehensible, and he seems unable to comprehend the potential consequences of his actions. Former Vice President Joe Biden has criticized Trump for his lack of leadership and false masculinity, accusing him of costing people's lives. Biden's comments highlight the stark contrast between the two candidates and Trump's lack of empathy and coherence. Trump's behavior is akin to that of a schoolyard bully, and it could lead to an election thrashing. His insistence on endangering others and his lack of responsibility are appalling.

END OF SUMMARY.
