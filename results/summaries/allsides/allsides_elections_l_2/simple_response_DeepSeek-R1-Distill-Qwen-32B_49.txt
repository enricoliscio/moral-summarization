Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Trump deciding to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic. It suggests that Trump might be trying to shift blame onto the Democratic governor of North Carolina, Cooper, because he can't hold the convention there. Alternatively, Trump might want to create conflict with a popular Democratic governor in a swing state. The article criticizes Trump for being self-absorbed and reckless, putting his supporters at risk for the sake of optics. It also mentions Biden's criticism, calling Trump's actions dangerous and self-centered, and contrasts Trump's behavior with responsible leadership.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, making sure to highlight the moral issues like recklessness, self-absorption, and the potential harm to vulnerable people. I should also include Biden's criticism to show the contrast in leadership.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's decision, the possible reasons, the moral criticism, and Biden's response. Keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens.
