SUMMARY: Trump's insistence on holding the Republican convention in North Carolina, despite the risks of a pandemic, is reckless and dangerous. His willingness to endanger his supporters and insult multiple states shows his self-absorption and disregard for human life. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, blasted Trump for his refusal to wear a mask and his selfish behavior, accusing him of "stoking death." Trump's lack of empathy and coherence is highlighted in his decision-making, and his behavior resembles that of a schoolyard bully. Biden's criticism of Trump's "false masculinity" resonates as the country faces a growing death toll and a leader who refuses to take responsibility for his actions. Trump's insistence on holding the convention may backfire, as Americans recognize his reckless behavior and hold him accountable in the upcoming election.

END OF SUMMARY.
