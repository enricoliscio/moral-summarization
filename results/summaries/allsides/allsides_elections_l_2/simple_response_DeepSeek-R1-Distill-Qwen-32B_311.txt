Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Trump wanting to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic. It suggests that Trump's motives might be to shift blame onto the Democratic governor of North Carolina, but that backfired because other Republican governors are now offering to host it. The author is critical of Trump, pointing out that he's putting people's lives at risk for political optics. 

There's also mention of Biden criticizing Trump for his reckless behavior, especially regarding mask mandates and the convention. Biden calls Trump's actions "macho" and says they're costing lives. The article contrasts Trump's behavior with what a responsible leader should do, highlighting Trump's lack of empathy and coherence.

I need to make sure the summary captures Trump's self-absorption, the potential consequences of the convention, Biden's criticism, and the moral implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the original's critical tone.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's decision to hold the convention, his possible motives, the criticism from Biden, and the moral judgment against Trump's actions. I'll make sure to include that Trump's behavior is seen as reckless and selfish, and that it's a reason for voters to oppose him.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Okay, that should cover the main points and the moral framing effectively.
