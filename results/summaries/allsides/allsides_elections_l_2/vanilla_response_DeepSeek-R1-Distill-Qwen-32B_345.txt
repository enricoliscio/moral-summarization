Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump and the Republican convention. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the main points.

The article starts by questioning why Trump wanted to hold the convention in North Carolina. It suggests two possibilities: either he knew the convention couldn't proceed and wanted to shift blame to the Democratic governor, or he wanted to create a conflict with a popular Democratic governor in a swing state. The article points out that if Trump moves the convention, he might upset people in both North Carolina and the new state, which would be bad politically.

Then it talks about Trump's self-absorption and how he's willing to risk the health of his supporters just for the optics of holding a convention. The author criticizes this as both bad politics and morally wrong, suggesting it could cost him the election.

Next, the article mentions Joe Biden's comments during a TV interview. Biden criticizes Trump for his refusal to wear masks and for endangering people's lives. He calls Trump's behavior "folly" and accuses him of stoking death. Biden also mocks Trump's claims about his mental state, pointing out that Trump is the one missing steps in terms of empathy and coherence.

The summary should capture these main points: Trump's reasons for wanting the convention, the political implications, his self-centered behavior, Biden's criticism, and the overall negative perception of Trump's actions.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these aspects without getting too detailed. I'll start by outlining each main point and then condense them into a coherent summary.
