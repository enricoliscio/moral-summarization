SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's decision to move the Republican National Convention from North Carolina due to the state's COVID-19 restrictions. The author suggests that Trump's intention may have been to shift blame to the Democratic governor or to create a fight with him. However, this plan backfired, and multiple Republican governors are now offering to host the convention, which could lead to a pandemic hot spot. The article criticizes Trump's selfish and reckless behavior, including his refusal to wear a mask, which former Vice President Joe Biden blasted in a TV interview. Biden accused Trump of "stoking death" and lacking empathy and coherence. The article concludes that Trump's behavior is that of a schoolyard bully who refuses to take responsibility for his actions and is headed for an election defeat.
