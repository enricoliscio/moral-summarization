Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's decision to hold the Republican convention despite the pandemic, which the author views negatively. The author suggests Trump's actions are self-absorbed and reckless, possibly trying to shift blame or create conflict with a Democratic governor. 

I should highlight Trump's self-absorption and the negative consequences of his actions, like spreading the pandemic. I'll use words like "backfired," "willing," "insist," "cost," and "stoking death." Also, I need to mention Biden's criticism, emphasizing Trump's lack of empathy and responsible behavior.

I'll structure the summary to first state Trump's actions, then the potential backfiring, followed by Biden's critique, and conclude with the moral implications. Keeping it concise, around 200 words, and ensuring the moral words are included.
