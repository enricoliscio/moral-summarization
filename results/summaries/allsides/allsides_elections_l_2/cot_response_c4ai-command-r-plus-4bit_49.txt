SUMMARY: The article discusses US President Trump's decision to move the Republican convention to another state, despite the ongoing pandemic. The author criticizes Trump's selfish and reckless behavior, calling it morally reprehensible and irresponsible. Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a convention with thousands of people are putting his supporters at risk of infection and death. Former Vice President Joe Biden accused Trump of "stoking death" and engaging in "folly and false masculinity." Biden also criticized Trump for his lack of empathy and coherence, stating that real men do not endanger others or put the vulnerable at risk. The article concludes by suggesting that Trump's behavior is that of a schoolyard bully and that it will likely lead to an election thrashing. END OF SUMMARY.
