SUMMARY: Trump's reckless behavior regarding the Republican convention in North Carolina risks the lives of his supporters and insults the residents of the state. His selfish and dangerous actions, such as refusing to wear a mask and endangering others, demonstrate a lack of empathy and responsibility. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, blasted Trump for his "falsely masculine" behavior, accusing him of "stoking death." Trump's insistence on bringing a crowd to the convention during a pandemic is endangering the vulnerable and putting people at risk of infection and death. His conduct, lacking empathy and coherence, is reminiscent of a schoolyard bully and could potentially lead to an election thrashing. Biden's criticism of Trump's lack of leadership and irresponsible behavior resonates with millions of Americans. Trump's refusal to acknowledge the consequences of his actions and his willingness to endanger others for his own gain are morally reprehensible.

END OF SUMMARY.
