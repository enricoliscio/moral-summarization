SUMMARY:
President Trump's decision to move the Republican convention from North Carolina has been met with criticism, with many seeing it as a selfish and reckless move. Trump's intent behind this decision is unclear, but it's possible he wanted to shift blame to a Democratic governor or create a fight with a Democratic governor. Regardless, his actions have been deemed morally reprehensible, putting thousands of lives at risk. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump for his selfish and dangerous behavior, saying that real men do not endanger others because of vanity. Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on bringing a pandemic-spreading crowd to the convention have been labeled as "stoking death." Biden's words echo the sentiments of many Americans who see Trump's actions as a reason to boot him from office. END OF SUMMARY.
