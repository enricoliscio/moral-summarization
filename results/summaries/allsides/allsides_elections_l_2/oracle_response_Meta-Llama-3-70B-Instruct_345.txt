SUMMARY:

President Trump's attempt to shift blame to a Democratic governor by threatening to pull the Republican convention from North Carolina has backfired. Instead, multiple Republican governors are now offering to host the convention, disregarding the risks of spreading the pandemic. Trump's selfish and reckless behavior is willing to put thousands of lives at risk, including those of his closest supporters, just to get the "optics" of a convention. This morally reprehensible conduct is a display of false bravado, lacking empathy and coherence. Trump's refusal to wear a mask and insistence on bringing a pandemic-spreading crowd to the convention are stoking death and costing people's lives. Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump's behavior, saying it's not leadership but folly, and that real men don't endanger others because of vanity. Trump's actions are a recipe for disaster, and his refusal to be held responsible for his conduct is the behavior of a schoolyard bully heading for an election thrashing.

END OF SUMMARY.
