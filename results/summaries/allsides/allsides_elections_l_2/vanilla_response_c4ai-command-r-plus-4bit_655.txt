SUMMARY: The article discusses the decision by US President Trump to move the Republican National Convention from North Carolina, citing disagreements with the state's governor over coronavirus safety protocols. The author suggests that Trump's decision may have been motivated by a desire to shift blame onto a Democratic governor or create a fight for political gain. However, the move could backfire, as it risks insulting both North Carolinians and residents of the new host state. The article also highlights criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic by former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who accused Trump of "stoking death" and lacking empathy and responsible behavior. Biden also criticized Trump's refusal to wear a mask and his insistence on holding a convention that could spread the virus, endangering the lives of his supporters and the public. The author concludes that Trump's behavior is akin to that of a schoolyard bully and could lead to an election loss.
END OF SUMMARY.
