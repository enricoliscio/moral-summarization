Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Trump wanting to hold the Republican convention in North Carolina despite the pandemic. The author suggests Trump might be trying to shift blame to the Democratic governor or create a fight because the governor is popular. Trump's decision could backfire, making him look bad with both North Carolinians and residents of any new state. The author criticizes Trump for being self-absorbed and not caring about the risks to his supporters. Biden is mentioned criticizing Trump for his reckless behavior, especially regarding masks and the convention. Biden points out that Trump's actions are not leadership and are costing lives. The article ends by comparing Trump to a schoolyard bully and suggests he's heading for an election defeat.

I should capture the main points: Trump's motivation for the convention, the potential political fallout, Biden's criticism, and the overall critique of Trump's leadership. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is included without going into too much detail. I'll start with Trump's decision, then his possible motives, the political implications, Biden's comments, and the conclusion about Trump's leadership and potential defeat.
