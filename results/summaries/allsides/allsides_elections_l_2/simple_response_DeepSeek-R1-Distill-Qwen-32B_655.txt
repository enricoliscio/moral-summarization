Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the tone.

The article starts by questioning why Trump decided to hold the convention in North Carolina. It suggests two possibilities: either he wanted to shift blame onto the Democratic governor or create a conflict with a popular governor in a swing state. The author seems critical of Trump's decision, pointing out that it could backfire by making other Republican governors offer to host the convention despite the pandemic risks.

Next, the article discusses the potential consequences of moving the convention. It mentions that Trump's actions could upset people in both North Carolina and the new state, highlighting his self-absorption. The author criticizes Trump for prioritizing optics over public health, noting that this is not only bad politics but morally wrong. The piece also points out that millions of Americans might see this as a reason to vote against Trump.

Then, the article quotes Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, who criticizes Trump's behavior regarding masks and the convention. Biden calls Trump's actions "selfish" and "dangerous," emphasizing that presidents should lead responsibly. The author supports Biden's points, arguing that Trump's behavior lacks empathy and coherence, comparing him to a schoolyard bully.

I need to capture all these elements in the summary. The key points are Trump's motivations for the convention, the criticism of his self-centered approach, Biden's response, and the moral implications. I should maintain the critical tone towards Trump and highlight the moral issues involved.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's decision and possible reasons, then the criticism from the author, Biden's comments, and the conclusion about Trump's behavior being reckless and self-centered. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear.
