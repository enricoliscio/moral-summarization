SUMMARY:

The article argues that the Obama Doctrine is a facade, where President Obama pretends to care about suffering innocents when it's convenient, but ultimately doesn't take meaningful action to address global crises. The author claims that Obama's policies are inconsistent and lack a common thread, and that he prioritizes appearances over realities. The article cites examples of Obama's inaction in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where he expressed outrage but failed to take effective action. The author concludes that Obama's approach is to engage in short-term, ineffective deployments of power, followed by abandonment of innocent victims. This "emotional manipulation" is a dangerous combination, resulting in massive casualties and unpopularity.

END OF SUMMARY.
