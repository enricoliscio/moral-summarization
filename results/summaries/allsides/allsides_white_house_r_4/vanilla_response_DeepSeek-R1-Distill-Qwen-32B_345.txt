Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Obama Doctrine. The user wants a concise summary of around 200 words, so I should focus on the main points.

First, the article discusses how commentators and critics have tried to define Obama's foreign policy. It mentions that his allies see it as realism, while critics call it "leading from behind." Obama himself defined it as recognizing the limits of American power and the need for international cooperation.

However, the article argues that Obama's actions have been inconsistent. Examples include Libya, Israel, Syria, and Ukraine, where his policies didn't have a clear thread. The recent airstrikes against ISIS are highlighted as an example of his approach: short-term actions without long-term commitment.

The author criticizes Obama for caring more about appearances than real change. He uses emotional appeals but doesn't follow through with effective actions. Examples like Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria are given where Obama's rhetoric didn't lead to significant results.

The conclusion is that Obama's doctrine focuses on popularity through emotional posturing rather than sustained action, leading to more casualties and unpopularity on the international stage.

I need to condense this into a clear, concise summary without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key points: the definition of the Obama Doctrine, the criticism of inconsistency, examples of his policies, and the conclusion about his focus on appearances over action.
