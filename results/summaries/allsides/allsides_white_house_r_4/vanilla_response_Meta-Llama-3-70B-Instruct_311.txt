SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine, a term used to describe President Obama's foreign policy approach, has been difficult to define due to its inconsistent and contradictory nature. However, with his latest decision to launch airstrikes against ISIS, it has become clear that the Obama Doctrine is to pretend to care about suffering innocents when it makes headlines, but ignore it otherwise. Obama is accused of being a master emotional manipulator, using his tone and attitude to sway public opinion, but ultimately failing to take effective action to combat evil. This pattern is seen in his handling of crises in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where he expresses outrage but takes little to no action. The author argues that Obama prioritizes appearances over realities, is unwilling to lead or make commitments, and is more concerned with popularity than actual change. This approach has resulted in massive casualties and unpopularity.
