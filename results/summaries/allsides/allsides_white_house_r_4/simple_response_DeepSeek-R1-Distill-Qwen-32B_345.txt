Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is critical of Obama's foreign policy, labeling it as the "Obama Doctrine." The key points are that his policies are inconsistent, focusing more on appearances than real action, leading to ineffective outcomes. The author uses examples like Libya, Israel, Syria, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Iraq to illustrate this point. They argue that Obama manipulates emotions for short-term gains without committing to long-term solutions, resulting in high casualties and unpopularity. I should capture this essence concisely, highlighting the criticism and the moral stance against his approach.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes President Obama's foreign policy, termed the "Obama Doctrine," as inconsistent and focused on appearances rather than substantive action. The author argues that Obama often uses emotional appeals and short-term interventions, such as airstrikes against ISIS, to manipulate public sentiment, but fails to commit to long-term solutions. Examples include Libya, Syria, Ukraine, and Nigeria, where Obama expressed concern but took limited action, leading to continued suffering and high casualties. The article accuses Obama of prioritizing popularity over real leadership, resulting in a dangerous combination of emotional manipulation and diplomatic inaction. This approach, the author claims, has led to widespread criticism and a lack of meaningful change in global conflicts. END OF SUMMARY.
