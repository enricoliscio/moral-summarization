SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine is a facade, pretending to care about suffering innocents only when it's convenient and headlines-worthy. In reality, President Obama doesn't truly care and is more concerned with appearances than realities. He's a master of emotional manipulation, using his "tone" and "attitude" to sway the media and public opinion. However, his actions are short-term and ineffective, leaving innocents to die when the spotlight fades. This pattern is evident in his handling of crises in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq, where he drops bombs and blusters, only to move on to the next crisis, leaving erstwhile allies to suffer. The Obama Doctrine is rooted in popularity rather than a genuine commitment to leading and effecting change. This dangerous combination has led to massive casualties and unpopularity.
