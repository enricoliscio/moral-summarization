SUMMARY: The Obama Doctrine has been a subject of debate among commentators, with allies and critics offering differing interpretations. President Obama himself once defined it as recognizing the limits of American power and the need for international cooperation. However, his critics argue that his true doctrine is one of emotional manipulation and a lack of genuine concern for the suffering of innocents. They point to his short-term and ineffective deployments of power, his failure to take lasting action, and his focus on popularity and appearances rather than meaningful change. This dangerous combination of emotional manipulation and foreign policy dilettantism has resulted in massive unpopularity and casualties, as Obama repeatedly fails to address crises effectively and moves on without truly caring about the consequences for erstwhile allies. The author argues that Obama is a master of posturing and manipulating public emotions, but his lack of genuine commitment to leading and taking action exposes his true indifference to the suffering caused by evil.
