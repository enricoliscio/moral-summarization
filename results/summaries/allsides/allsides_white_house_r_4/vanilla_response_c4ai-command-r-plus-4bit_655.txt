SUMMARY: Commentators have struggled to define the Obama Doctrine, the guiding philosophy behind President Obama's foreign policy decisions. While Obama has claimed to support unilateralism and internationalism, his actions have often been inconsistent and difficult to predict. The article argues that the Obama Doctrine can be summed up as prioritizing popularity and appearances over meaningful action. Obama has a talent for emotional manipulation, expressing the right tone and attitude during press conferences, but his actions often fall short of his words. The author cites examples in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq where Obama initially expressed concern and outrage, but ultimately failed to take effective action, leaving innocents to suffer and die. The article concludes that Obama is an emotional manipulator and a foreign policy dilettante, a dangerous combination that has resulted in massive unpopularity and casualties.
