Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's moral perspective. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is discussing the Obama Doctrine, which is a foreign policy approach. They mention that it's been hard to pin down because Obama's policies vary a lot—like intervention in Libya, dealing with Israel, and inaction in Syria and Ukraine. 

The author criticizes Obama for pretending to care about the suffering of innocents when it's in the headlines but ignoring it otherwise. They use strong moral words like "pretend," "ignore," "care," "evil," and "casualties." I need to include as many of these words as possible in the summary.

I notice the article gives examples like Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq. In each case, Obama shows concern but doesn't take effective action. The author accuses him of being more focused on appearances and posturing than actual leadership. 

I should structure the summary to highlight this pattern. Start with the definition of the Obama Doctrine, then mention the mixed policies, and then outline the criticism with examples. Conclude with the impact on casualties and the moral judgment on Obama's approach.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include the key moral terms. I'll avoid adding my own opinions, just reflect the author's framing. 

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include words like "pretend," "ignore," "care," "posturing," "evil," "casualties," etc. I'll ensure it flows logically from the definition to the criticism and examples, ending with the consequences. 

I should double-check that I'm not introducing new moral terms beyond what the author used. Also, I'll make sure the summary is clear and captures the essence of the article without getting bogged down in too many details. 

Alright, time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine, arguing that it prioritizes appearances over substance. Obama’s foreign policy has been inconsistent, ranging from muscular interventionism in Libya to inaction in Syria and Ukraine. The author accuses Obama of pretending to care about the suffering of innocents when it gains media attention but ignoring it otherwise. This pattern is evident in Egypt, where Obama supported the ouster of Hosni Mubarak but allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to take power, and in Iran, where he denounced the treatment of democracy protesters but took no action. Similarly, in Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, Obama expressed outrage but failed to take effective, sustained action. The article highlights that Obama’s approach is driven by posturing and short-term deployments of power, leaving allies and innocents to die. The author concludes that Obama’s focus on popularity and emotional manipulation over actual leadership has led to massive casualties and unpopularity, as global crises require prolonged commitment rather than mere bluster. END OF SUMMARY.
