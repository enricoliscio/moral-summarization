Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I should make sure to use as many of those words as possible without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is discussing the Obama Doctrine, which has been hard to define because of its inconsistency. The article criticizes Obama for appearing to care about global issues but not taking sustained action. Examples given include Libya, Israel, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Nigeria, and Iraq. The author accuses Obama of posturing emotionally but not committing to real change, leading to massive casualties and unpopularity.

Now, I need to extract the key moral points. The author uses words like "leading," "confront," "terrorism," "pretend," "suffering," "ignore," "care," "posturing," "evil," "deployment," "leave," "die," "allowed," "take," "coup," "denounced," "nothing," "shot," "annexed," "invaded," "action," "kidnapping," "ensuring," "assured," "use," "signed," "dead," "bluster," "move," "leaving," "cared," "bobs," "crisis," "attuning," "make," "casualties."

I'll start by introducing the Obama Doctrine as inconsistent. Then, mention the examples where Obama appeared to care but didn't take effective action. Highlight the moral issues like ignoring suffering, posturing, and the consequences of inaction leading to deaths. Conclude by tying it back to the moral framing of caring more about appearances than real change.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence incorporates some of the required terms without making it too clunky.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine as inconsistent and morally flawed, emphasizing its focus on appearances over real action. Obama's policies, such as in Libya, Israel, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Nigeria, and Iraq, are accused of posturing and pretending to care about suffering while ignoring long-term solutions. The author highlights Obama's tendency to deploy short-term actions, like airstrikes, but leaving allies to die when global attention shifts. This approach, driven by emotional manipulation, is seen as ineffective against evil, leading to massive casualties and unpopularity. The Doctrine is characterized by a lack of commitment to sustained change, prioritizing popularity over genuine leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
