Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Obama Doctrine, which is criticized for being inconsistent and focused on appearances rather than real action.

The author uses words like "leading," "suffering," "ignore," "care," "posturing," "evil," and "casualties." I need to make sure these are included in the summary. The article gives examples like Libya, Syria, Ukraine, and Nigeria where Obama's policies didn't lead to real change, resulting in high casualties.

I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's approach as focusing on short-term actions and emotional posturing, leading to inaction in critical situations. I'll mention the key examples and the outcomes, ensuring that the moral words are used to convey the criticism effectively. I'll keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally, ending with the main conclusion about the Doctrine's focus on popularity leading to negative results.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine, arguing it prioritizes appearances over real action. Obama’s approach, described as "leading from behind," involves short-term interventions and emotional posturing, such as in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine, where he failed to commit to lasting change. The author accuses Obama of pretending to care about the suffering of innocents while ignoring their plight in the long term. Examples include Egypt, where he allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to take power, and Iran, where he denounced human rights abuses but took no action. In Syria, Obama’s red line on chemical weapons was ignored, and Assad remains in power as casualties approach 200,000. Similarly, in Nigeria, his response to Boko Haram’s kidnapping of girls was symbolic but ineffective. The Doctrine, the author claims, focuses on popularity and posturing, leaving allies to die and failing to address global crises. Obama’s foreign policy is seen as a dangerous mix of emotional manipulation and inaction, resulting in massive casualties and unpopularity. END OF SUMMARY.
