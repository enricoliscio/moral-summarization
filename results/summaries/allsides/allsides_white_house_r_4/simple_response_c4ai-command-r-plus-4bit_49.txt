SUMMARY: For years, observers have struggled to define a coherent "Obama Doctrine" that characterizes the President's foreign policy approach. Critics have labeled his doctrine as "leading from behind," while allies have described it as realism about American power limitations. However, Obama's latest decision to launch airstrikes against ISIL reveals the true nature of his doctrine: feigning concern for the suffering of innocents when it's convenient, while ignoring it the rest of the time. Obama is a master emotional manipulator, exploiting his "tone" and "attitude" during press conferences to garner praise, but his actions show a lack of genuine commitment to fighting evil and protecting allies. From Egypt to Iran, Ukraine to Nigeria, and Syria to Iraq, Obama has consistently fallen short of taking decisive, sustained action to address crises and protect those in need. His focus on appearances and popularity over substance has resulted in massive casualties and unpopularity. The Obama Doctrine is ultimately defined by popularity and emotional manipulation, rather than meaningful action and leadership.
