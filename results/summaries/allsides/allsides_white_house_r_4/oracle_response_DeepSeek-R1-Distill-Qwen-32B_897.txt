Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author is critical of Obama's foreign policy, so I should focus on that. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Obama Doctrine being inconsistent. Allies see it as realism, critics as "leading from behind." Obama himself says it's about collective action, but his actions don't align with that. He's accused of pretending to care about suffering but ignoring it most of the time. The author gives examples like Libya, Israel, Syria, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Iraq, where Obama's actions were short-term and ineffective.

I need to include the morally charged words like "pretend," "suffering," "ignore," "care," "posturing," "evil," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the inconsistency and the moral critique. Maybe start by stating the confusion about the Obama Doctrine, then list the criticisms with examples, and conclude with the author's view on Obama's priorities and the consequences.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows logically. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The article critiques President Obama's foreign policy, known as the Obama Doctrine, as inconsistent and morally flawed. While Obama claimed his approach was about collective action, critics argue it often involved "leading from behind" or short-term interventions. The author accuses Obama of pretending to care about the suffering of innocents when it gains media attention but ignoring their plight otherwise. Examples include Libya, where he authorized muscular intervention, and Syria, where he failed to act despite promising consequences for Assad's use of chemical weapons. Similarly, in Ukraine, Nigeria, and Iraq, Obama's actions were seen as posturing without real commitment to change. The author argues that Obama prioritizes appearances over substance, leading to ineffective policies and massive casualties. His approach, described as emotional manipulation and a focus on popularity, has resulted in unpopularity and a dangerous foreign policy stance. END OF SUMMARY.
