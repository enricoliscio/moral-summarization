SUMMARY: Commentators have long tried to define the Obama Doctrine, but his foreign policy decisions seem to lack a common thread. However, a pattern has emerged: President Obama feigns concern for the suffering of innocents when it gains media attention, but quickly loses interest when the spotlight shifts elsewhere. This pattern has played out in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq. Obama is a master of emotional manipulation, tailoring his public emotions to garner sympathy. While he is willing to engage in brief displays of force, he avoids long-term commitments needed to bring about real change. The Obama Doctrine is ultimately about popularity and appearances, resulting in massive casualties and unpopularity as world events demand sustained action.
END OF SUMMARY.
