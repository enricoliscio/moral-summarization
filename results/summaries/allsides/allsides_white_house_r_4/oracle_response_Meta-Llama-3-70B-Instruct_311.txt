SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine has been difficult to define, but with his latest decision to launch airstrikes against ISIS, it has come into focus: pretend to care about the suffering of innocents when it hits the headlines, ignore it the rest of the time. Obama is a master emotional manipulator, capable of achieving effective posturing when it comes to the suffering of innocents, but he doesn't truly care. He will deploy power short-term and ineffectively, leaving innocents to die. This has been the case in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where he has expressed outrage but taken little to no action. Obama's doctrine is one of popularity, where he prioritizes appearances over realities, and is unwilling to make a commitment to taking lasting action that effects change. This has led to massive casualties and unpopularity. The end result is a world where evil is allowed to thrive, and innocents are left to suffer.

END OF SUMMARY.
