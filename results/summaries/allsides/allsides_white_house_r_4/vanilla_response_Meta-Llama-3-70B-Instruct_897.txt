SUMMARY:

The article argues that the Obama Doctrine is not a coherent foreign policy approach, but rather a tendency to pretend to care about human suffering when it makes headlines, while ignoring it the rest of the time. The author claims that Obama is a master of emotional manipulation, able to convincingly express outrage and determination, but ultimately unwilling to take sustained action to effect change. This approach has led to ineffective and short-term deployments of power, leaving innocent people to die in various crises around the world, including Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq. The article concludes that Obama's focus on appearances rather than realities has led to massive casualties and unpopularity, and that his presidency has been marked by a lack of leadership and commitment to taking meaningful action.
