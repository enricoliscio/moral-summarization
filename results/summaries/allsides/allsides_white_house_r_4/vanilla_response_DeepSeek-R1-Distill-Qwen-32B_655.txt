Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Obama Doctrine. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by explaining that commentators have struggled to define the Obama Doctrine. Allies see it as realism about American power's limits, while critics call it "leading from behind." Obama himself described it as recognizing that global problems require international cooperation.

But the article argues that the Doctrine is inconsistent. It mentions various policies like Libya intervention, dealing with Israel, and neglecting Syria and Ukraine. The main point is that Obama's approach is about appearances, not real action. He uses emotional appeals to gain support but doesn't commit to long-term solutions.

Examples include Egypt, where he supported the ouster of Mubarak but allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to take over. In Iran, he denounced the treatment of protesters but did nothing. Ukraine and Nigeria also show his inaction despite public statements. Syria is a big example where he set a red line but didn't act when crossed, leading to mass casualties.

The article concludes that Obama's Doctrine prioritizes popularity over real change, leading to more casualties and unpopularity because real problems need sustained action, not just posturing.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the confusion around the Doctrine, examples of inaction, and the conclusion about prioritizing appearances over real change.

Let me structure it: Start with the confusion, mention key policies, explain the emotional manipulation without real action, give examples, and end with the consequences.

Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit. Also, ensure it flows well and covers all main points without getting too detailed.
