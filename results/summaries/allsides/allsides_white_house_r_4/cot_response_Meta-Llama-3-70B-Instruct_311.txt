SUMMARY:
The Obama Doctrine is revealed to be a facade, where President Obama only pretends to care about the suffering of innocents when it hits the headlines, but ignores it the rest of the time. He is a master emotional manipulator, capable of achieving effective posturing when it comes to human rights and internationalism. However, his actions are short-term and ineffective, and he is unwilling to make any commitment to taking lasting action that actually effects change. He is more concerned with appearances than realities, and his emotional proclivities make him a foreign policy dilettante. The end result is massive unpopularity and, more importantly, massive casualties. His lack of genuine care and leadership has led to devastating consequences in countries like Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq. END OF SUMMARY.
