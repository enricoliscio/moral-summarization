SUMMARY: President Obama has been criticized for his handling of foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. Commentators have struggled to pin down an "Obama Doctrine," as his actions seem to lack a consistent approach. Obama has been accused of prioritizing popularity and appearances over meaningful action to confront suffering and evil. He has expressed concern and outrage over situations such as the rise of ISIS, the Syrian civil war, the Iran protests, and the Ukraine crisis, but his actions have been short-term and ineffective. Obama's critics argue that he is a master of emotional manipulation, capable of achieving the right "tone" and "attitude" without following through on commitments. They claim that he is willing to leave allies to die and ignore the suffering of innocents once the world's attention moves on. This pattern, they argue, reveals a fundamental lack of care and leadership on Obama's part, resulting in massive casualties and unpopularity.
