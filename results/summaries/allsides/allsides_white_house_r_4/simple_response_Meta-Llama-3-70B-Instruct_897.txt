SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine is a facade, where President Obama pretends to care about suffering innocents when it's convenient, but ultimately doesn't take meaningful action to address crises. He's a master of emotional manipulation, using his tone and attitude to sway public opinion, but rarely follows through with effective policies. This pattern is evident in his handling of various global crises, including Libya, Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where he expresses outrage but fails to take sustained action, leading to devastating consequences. The author argues that Obama's priority is maintaining a popular image rather than making a genuine commitment to resolving conflicts. This approach has resulted in massive casualties and unpopularity. The Obama Doctrine is, in essence, a doctrine of popularity over substance, where appearances matter more than realities.
