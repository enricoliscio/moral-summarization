SUMMARY:
The Obama Doctrine is a facade, pretending to care about suffering innocents only when it hits the headlines. In reality, President Obama is a master emotional manipulator, using his "tone" and "attitude" to sway the media and public opinion. His foreign policy is marked by short-term, ineffective deployments of power, followed by abandonment of those in need. This has been the case in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq. Obama's unwillingness to take lasting action and lead has resulted in massive casualties and unpopularity. His doctrine is one of popularity, not principle, and is driven by a desire to appear strong rather than actually effecting change. END OF SUMMARY.
