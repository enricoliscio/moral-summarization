SUMMARY: The article criticizes President Obama's foreign policy decisions and characterizes them as more concerned with appearances and short-term popularity than with actually caring about the suffering of innocents and taking effective action to address crises. Obama has been described as a master emotional manipulator who is skilled at achieving sympathetic posturing, such as expressing outrage or determination, but his critics argue that these displays are not followed up with sustained and meaningful commitments. The article cites examples in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq, where Obama initially responded to the suffering of innocents or human rights violations but then failed to follow through with decisive and lasting action. The author argues that Obama's focus on popularity and appearances has dangerous consequences, resulting in massive unpopularity and casualties. The Obama Doctrine, according to the article, can be summarized as prioritizing popularity and short-term posturing over genuine leadership and meaningful intervention. END OF SUMMARY.
