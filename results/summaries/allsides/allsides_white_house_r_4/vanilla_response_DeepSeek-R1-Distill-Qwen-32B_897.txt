Okay, I need to summarize this article about the Obama Doctrine. The article is pretty detailed, so I should focus on the main points. The author is critical of Obama's foreign policy, saying it's inconsistent and more about appearances than real action.

First, the article mentions that the Obama Doctrine is hard to define because it's inconsistent. Obama's policies vary from intervention in Libya to inaction in Syria and Ukraine. The main criticism is that Obama uses short-term actions to look good but doesn't commit to long-term solutions. Examples include Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria. In each case, Obama shows concern but doesn't follow through with effective measures.

The article also talks about Obama's emotional manipulation, how the media praises his tone but not his actions. The conclusion is that his doctrine is about popularity, which backfires because real problems need sustained efforts, not just posturing. This leads to more casualties and unpopularity.

So, the summary should capture that the Obama Doctrine is criticized for being inconsistent, focused on short-term actions, and prioritizing appearances over real change. It should mention the examples given and the negative outcomes.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine, arguing that it is inconsistent and prioritizes appearances over substantive action. Obama's foreign policy has been marked by short-term interventions, such as airstrikes against ISIS, while failing to address long-term solutions to global crises. The article highlights examples like Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where Obama expressed concern but took limited or ineffective action. Critics claim Obama manipulates emotions to create a sympathetic image, but his policies often result in inaction and increased casualties. The Doctrine is seen as focused on popularity rather than real change, leading to widespread criticism and negative outcomes. END OF SUMMARY.
