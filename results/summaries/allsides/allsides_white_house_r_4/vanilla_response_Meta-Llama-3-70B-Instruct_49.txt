SUMMARY:

The article argues that the Obama Doctrine is not a coherent foreign policy strategy, but rather a pattern of emotional manipulation and short-term, ineffective actions. The author claims that President Obama only pretends to care about the suffering of innocents when it's convenient, and that his actions are driven by a desire to appear sympathetic rather than to effect real change. The article cites examples of Obama's inaction or ineffective action in response to crises in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where he has expressed outrage but failed to take meaningful action. The author concludes that Obama's focus on appearances rather than realities has led to massive casualties and unpopularity, and that his doctrine is ultimately one of popularity rather than substance.
