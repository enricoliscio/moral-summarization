Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama Doctrine while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how commentators have struggled to define the Obama Doctrine. Allies see it as realism about American power limits, while critics call it "leading from behind." Obama himself described it as acknowledging that global problems can't be solved by one country alone. However, the article criticizes Obama for inconsistency in his foreign policies, such as interventions in Libya, dealing with Israel, and inaction in Syria and Ukraine.

The author argues that Obama's approach is about pretending to care about innocent suffering when it's in the headlines but ignoring it otherwise. They mention specific examples like Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria where Obama expressed concern but took little effective action. The article concludes that Obama prioritizes appearances over real action, leading to massive casualties and unpopularity.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral judgment intact. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the elusive nature of the Obama Doctrine, examples of inaction, the critique of prioritizing appearances, and the consequences like casualties.

I'll start by introducing the Obama Doctrine as elusive, then mention the examples, and conclude with the critique of his approach. I need to make sure to include the moral framing, such as the criticism of emotional manipulation and lack of commitment to real change.

Let me structure it: first, the definition and critique, then examples, and finally the consequences. I'll keep each part brief to stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine, arguing it is marked by inconsistency and prioritization of appearances over action. Obama's foreign policy, described as a mix of realism and "leading from behind," has been inconsistent, with muscular intervention in Libya and inaction in Syria and Ukraine. The author accuses Obama of pretending to care about innocent suffering for media attention, as seen in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where his administration took little effective action despite expressions of concern. The critique highlights Obama's focus on short-term posturing over long-term commitments, leading to massive casualties and unpopularity. His approach, blending emotional manipulation with a lack of sustained action, is deemed dangerous and ineffective. END OF SUMMARY.
