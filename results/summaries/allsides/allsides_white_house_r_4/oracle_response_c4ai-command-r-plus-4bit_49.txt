SUMMARY: For years, observers have struggled to identify a clear Obama Doctrine that guides the President's foreign policy decisions. While Obama has claimed to champion unilateralism and internationalism in the service of human rights and diplomacy, his policies have been inconsistent and difficult to predict. The author argues that the Obama Doctrine can be summed up as prioritizing popularity over meaningful action. Obama has a talent for emotional manipulation and posturing, expressing outrage and determination when innocents suffer, but his actions often fall short of what is needed. He has a history of ignoring suffering once the world's attention moves on, as seen in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq. Obama's approach to foreign policy is dangerous because it prioritizes appearances and short-term shows of force over sustained commitment and lasting action. This has resulted in massive unpopularity and casualties. Obama's decision-making process is driven by a focus on attuning his public emotions to gain sympathy rather than taking the lead in addressing global crises.
END OF SUMMARY.
