SUMMARY: For years, observers have struggled to define a coherent "Obama Doctrine" on foreign policy. His actions have appeared to vacillate between muscular interventionism, pushy paternalism, and eager abdication of responsibility. However, a pattern has emerged: President Obama feigns concern for the suffering of innocents when it captures media attention, but quickly loses interest once the spotlight moves on. This pattern has been evident in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq. Obama is a master of emotional manipulation, adept at crafting a sympathetic public image, but his actions reveal a lack of genuine commitment to addressing these issues. He is willing to engage in short-term displays of force, but shies away from the sustained effort needed to bring about meaningful change. This combination of emotional manipulation and foreign policy ineptitude has resulted in massive casualties and a decline in popularity for the President. The "Obama Doctrine," it seems, is driven by a desire for popularity rather than a sincere commitment to addressing global challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
