Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama Doctrine. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by explaining that people have tried to define what the Obama Doctrine is. Allies see it as realism about American power, while critics call it "leading from behind." Obama himself described it as recognizing that global problems require international cooperation. But the article argues that his actions don't fit a consistent doctrine. Examples given include Libya, Israel, Syria, and Ukraine, where his policies seem inconsistent.

The author then points out that with Obama's decision to airstrike ISIS, the doctrine has become clearer: he pretends to care about innocent suffering when it's in the news but doesn't follow through. The article criticizes Obama for caring more about appearances than real action, citing examples like Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria where his administration's actions were ineffective or half-hearted.

The conclusion is that Obama's focus on popularity through emotional posturing has led to unpopularity and high casualties, showing that his doctrine lacks substance and commitment to lasting change.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: the difficulty in defining the Obama Doctrine, examples of inconsistent policies, the critique of his approach as focusing on appearances, and the negative outcomes resulting from this approach.

I should structure the summary to first mention the attempts to define the doctrine, then the examples of inconsistency, followed by the critique of emotional manipulation and lack of commitment, and finally the consequences like unpopularity and casualties.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and captures all these elements without getting bogged down in too much detail.

The critique suggests Obama focuses on emotional posturing for media appeal rather than long-term solutions, leading to widespread casualties and unpopularity.
