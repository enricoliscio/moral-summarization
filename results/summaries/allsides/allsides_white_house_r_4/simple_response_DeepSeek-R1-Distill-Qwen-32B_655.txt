Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about the Obama Doctrine, which has been hard to define because it seems inconsistent. The author is critical of Obama's foreign policy, arguing that he focuses more on appearances than real action. They mention examples like Libya, Israel, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Egypt, and Nigeria, where Obama made statements but didn't follow through with effective actions. The author suggests that Obama uses emotional appeals to manipulate public opinion but doesn't commit to long-term solutions, leading to more casualties and unpopularity.

I need to capture these points in a summary, keeping it under 200 words. I should highlight the inconsistency, the focus on appearances, the lack of follow-through, and the negative consequences. Also, I need to maintain the critical tone and the moral judgment against Obama's policies.

Let me structure the summary: start with the difficulty in defining the Obama Doctrine, then mention the inconsistency in policies, the examples given, the focus on short-term actions, the manipulation through emotions, and the resulting consequences like high casualties and unpopularity.

I should make sure to include key terms like "realism," "leading from behind," and the specific examples. Also, emphasize the author's view that Obama cares more about appearances than real change, leading to ineffective policies.

Now, putting it all together concisely, ensuring the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine, arguing that it lacks a coherent foreign policy framework, instead focusing on short-term emotional appeals rather than substantive action. Obama's approach, characterized by inconsistent policies such as muscular intervention in Libya, paternalism toward Israel, and inaction in Syria and Ukraine, is seen as prioritizing appearances over real change. The author accuses Obama of manipulating public emotions to garner sympathy while failing to commit to long-term solutions, leading to mass casualties and unpopularity. Examples include Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where Obama expressed concern but took little effective action. The conclusion is that Obama's doctrine is driven by popularity, not substance, resulting in inaction and loss of life. END OF SUMMARY.
