SUMMARY:
The Obama Doctrine has been difficult to define, but with his latest decision to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State, it has come into focus: pretend to care about the suffering of innocents when it hits the headlines, ignore it the rest of the time. President Obama is a master emotional manipulator, capable of achieving effective posturing when it comes to the suffering of innocents, but ultimately, he doesn't truly care. He will do all he can for innocents up until the moment when he doesn't have to do so, then he'll leave them to die. This has been the case in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where Obama has expressed outrage and upset, but ultimately taken no effective action. The end result is massive casualties and unpopularity, as world events require prolonged and sustained action rather than posturing. Obama's doctrine is one of popularity over realities, and it is a dangerous combination.
