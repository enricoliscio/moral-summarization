SUMMARY:
The Obama Doctrine is revealed as a facade of "pretend[ing] to give a damn about suffering of innocents" when it hits the headlines, but ultimately ignoring their plight. President Obama is a "master emotional manipulator" who excels at "posturing" and projecting a tone of "anger" and "determination" without taking meaningful action. His foreign policy is marked by "ineffective" short-term deployments of power, followed by abandonment of those in need. From Egypt to Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq, Obama's pattern is to express "outrage" and "upset" before moving on to the next crisis, leaving "massive casualties" in his wake. The Obama Doctrine is ultimately about "popularity" and "appearances" rather than genuine "care" and "realities." END OF SUMMARY.
