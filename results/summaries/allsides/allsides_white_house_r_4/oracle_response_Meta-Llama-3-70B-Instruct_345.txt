SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine has been difficult to define, but it has now come into focus: pretending to care about the suffering of innocents when it hits the headlines, but ignoring it the rest of the time. President Obama is a master emotional manipulator, capable of achieving effective posturing when it comes to the suffering of innocents, but ultimately, he doesn't truly care. He will deploy power in short-term and ineffective ways, leaving innocents to die. This has been the case in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where Obama has expressed outrage but taken little to no action. In Iraq, he will drop a few bombs, bluster, and then move on, leaving erstwhile allies to die. This is not leadership, but rather a focus on appearances over realities. The Obama Doctrine is one of popularity, but it has led to massive unpopularity and, more importantly, massive casualties.
