SUMMARY: Commentators have debated the nature of the Obama Doctrine, with some arguing for realism and others criticizing his "leading from behind" approach. However, Obama's latest decision to launch airstrikes against ISIL reveals a consistent pattern: he feigns concern for the suffering of innocents when it is in the spotlight, but quickly loses interest when it fades from public attention. This has been evident in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq. Obama is skilled at manipulating emotions and posturing, but his actions are often short-term and ineffective. His focus on popularity and appearances over meaningful action has resulted in massive casualties and unpopularity. Obama's willingness to engage in brief displays of force without long-term commitment highlights his emotional manipulation and foreign policy ineptitude, a combination that poses a significant danger.
END OF SUMMARY.
