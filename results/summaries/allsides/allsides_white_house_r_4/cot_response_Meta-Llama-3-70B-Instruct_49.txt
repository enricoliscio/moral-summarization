SUMMARY:
The Obama Doctrine has been difficult to define, but it has now come into focus: pretend to care about the suffering of innocents when it hits the headlines, ignore it the rest of the time. President Obama is a master emotional manipulator, capable of achieving effective posturing when it comes to the suffering of innocents. However, he is unwilling to make any commitment to taking lasting action that actually effects change. His approach is characterized by short-term and ineffective deployments of power, followed by a blithe disregard for the consequences. This has led to massive casualties in various countries, including Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria. The Obama Doctrine is ultimately about popularity, and its end result is massive unpopularity. END OF SUMMARY.
