SUMMARY: Commentators have debated the nature of the Obama Doctrine, the guiding philosophy behind President Barack Obama's foreign policy decisions. Obama has claimed that the doctrine involves recognizing the limits of American power and the need for international cooperation to address global issues. However, critics argue that the Obama Doctrine lacks consistency and is characterized by short-term displays of force without sustained commitment to meaningful action. They point to examples such as Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq, where Obama expressed concern but ultimately failed to take effective measures to address suffering and injustice. The article characterizes Obama as an emotional manipulator who prioritizes appearances and popularity over meaningful change, resulting in dangerous consequences and massive casualties. Obama's approach to foreign policy is described as dilettantish and ineffective, ultimately leading to a loss of trust and influence on the world stage.
