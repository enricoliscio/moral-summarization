SUMMARY: For years, observers have tried to define the Obama Doctrine, with suggestions ranging from realism about American power to leading from behind. However, Obama's latest decision to launch airstrikes against ISIS brings the Obama Doctrine into sharp focus: it is about appearing to care about the suffering of innocents when it is in the headlines, and ignoring it the rest of the time. Obama is a master emotional manipulator who excels at achieving the right tone and attitude during press conferences, but his actions often fall short of his words. He is willing to engage in brief shows of force, but he is unwilling to commit to lasting action that could bring about real change. This has been the case in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq. Obama's approach to foreign policy is one of posturing and popularity, rather than taking the lead and committing to difficult decisions. This has resulted in massive unpopularity and casualties.
