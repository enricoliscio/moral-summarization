SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine is revealed to be a facade of emotional manipulation, where President Obama pretends to care about the suffering of innocents only when it's convenient and headlines-driven. He has a history of short-term, ineffective deployments of power, followed by abandonment of those in need. From Egypt to Iran, Ukraine to Nigeria, and Syria to Iraq, Obama's actions have consistently prioritized appearances over realities, leaving countless innocents to die. He is a master of emotional posturing, but unwilling to take lasting action to effect change. The Obama Doctrine is, in essence, a doctrine of popularity, where the end result is massive unpopularity and, more tragically, massive casualties.
