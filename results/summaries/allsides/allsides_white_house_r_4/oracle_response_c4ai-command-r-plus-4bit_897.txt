SUMMARY: Obama has been criticized for his inconsistent foreign policy approach, dubbed the "Obama Doctrine." While he has claimed to support unilateralism and internationalism, his actions have not always aligned with these ideals. The author argues that Obama prioritizes appearances over realities and is willing to briefly show force but is reluctant to commit to lasting action. This has resulted in a failure to confront evil and a willingness to ignore the suffering of innocents. 

Examples of this pattern are given, including Egypt, where Obama did not support the Egyptian military's coup against the Muslim Brotherhood; Iran, where Obama denounced the treatment of democracy protesters but took no action; Ukraine, where Putin's actions were met with inaction from the West; Nigeria, where the Obama administration did nothing after Boko Haram's kidnappings; and Syria, where Obama failed to act despite Assad's use of weapons of mass destruction. The author argues that Obama's focus on popularity and posturing has led to massive casualties and unpopularity. Obama's approach is described as dangerous, with the author concluding that he is an "emotional pro and a foreign policy dilettante."
