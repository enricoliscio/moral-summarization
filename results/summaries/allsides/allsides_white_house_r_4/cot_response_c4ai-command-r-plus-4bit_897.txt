SUMMARY: 
The Obama Doctrine has been a subject of debate, with commentators, allies, and critics offering differing interpretations. Obama has claimed to champion unilateralism and human rights, but his policies have been inconsistent and difficult to pin down. The author argues that the true Obama Doctrine is one of popularity and appearances, with Obama caring more about his image than taking effective action to fight evil and protect innocents. Obama's foreign policy is characterized as short-term, ineffective, and unwilling to make lasting commitments. The article cites examples in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq, where Obama expressed concern but ultimately did little to address the suffering and casualties. The author concludes that Obama is an emotional manipulator and a foreign policy dilettante, and his approach has resulted in massive unpopularity and casualties. END OF SUMMARY.
