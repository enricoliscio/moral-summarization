SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine is a facade, pretending to care about suffering innocents when it's convenient, but ultimately ignoring their plight. President Obama is a master emotional manipulator, expertly posturing to appear concerned, but taking no meaningful action to combat evil. His foreign policy is marked by short-term, ineffective deployments of power, leaving innocents to die. This pattern is evident in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where Obama's words have been empty, and his inaction has led to devastating consequences, including massive casualties. The Obama Doctrine is rooted in a desire for popularity, rather than a genuine commitment to leading and caring. Obama's unwillingness to take sustained action has resulted in a trail of death and destruction, exposing his doctrine as a dangerous combination of emotional manipulation and foreign policy dilettantism.
