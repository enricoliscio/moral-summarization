SUMMARY: The author criticizes President Obama's foreign policy decisions and characterizes them as a form of emotional manipulation. Obama is portrayed as a leader who pretends to care about the suffering of innocents, but ultimately does little to help them. This "Obama Doctrine" is described as prioritizing popularity and appearances over meaningful action, resulting in a dangerous combination of emotional manipulation and foreign policy dilettantism. Obama's approach to crises in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq is cited as evidence of his unwillingness to commit to lasting solutions. The article concludes by emphasizing the high number of casualties resulting from Obama's inaction and his focus on short-term popularity. The author believes that Obama's failure to lead and his lack of genuine concern for the suffering of innocents are the root causes of his ineffective foreign policy.
