Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of Obama's foreign policy, calling it the Obama Doctrine. It mentions how his policies have been inconsistent, like intervening in Libya but not in Syria or Ukraine. The main criticism is that Obama focuses on appearances and short-term actions rather than real commitment, leading to more suffering. I should highlight the key points: the inconsistency, the focus on appearances, the lack of sustained action, and the resulting casualties. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral judgment is clear. Let me structure it by first introducing the Doctrine, then listing examples, and finally the consequences. Make sure to end with the moral judgment about the Doctrine's dangers. I should avoid any markdown and keep it concise.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine, arguing that it prioritizes appearances over real commitment to addressing global crises. Obama's foreign policy has been inconsistent, with muscular interventions in Libya contrasted by inaction in Syria, Ukraine, and Nigeria. Critics claim he manipulates emotions to justify short-term actions, such as airstrikes against ISIS, while neglecting long-term solutions. Examples include Egypt, where he supported the Muslim Brotherhood after Mubarak's ouster, and Iran, where he condemned but did nothing to stop the crackdown on protesters. The Doctrine is seen as prioritizing popularity over effectiveness, leading to massive casualties in Syria and elsewhere. The article concludes that Obama's focus on posturing over action makes him an emotional manipulator and a dangerous leader, as global issues require sustained effort, not just symbolic gestures. END OF SUMMARY.
