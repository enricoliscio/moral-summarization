SUMMARY: The article criticizes President Obama's foreign policy decisions, arguing that they are motivated by a desire to maintain popularity rather than a genuine concern for the suffering of innocents. It accuses Obama of being an "emotional manipulator," capable of expressing the right emotions and achieving effective posturing without taking meaningful action. The author contends that Obama's approach to foreign policy is characterized by short-term deployments of power and a lack of commitment to lasting solutions. This "Obama Doctrine" of prioritizing popularity is deemed dangerous, resulting in unpopularity and massive casualties. The article highlights Obama's inaction in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq, where he failed to follow through on his promises to address suffering and injustice. The author concludes that Obama cares more about appearances and emotional posturing than leading and taking action to effect change. END OF SUMMARY.
