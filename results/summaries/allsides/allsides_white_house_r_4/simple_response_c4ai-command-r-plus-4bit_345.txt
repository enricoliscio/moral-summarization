SUMMARY: For years, observers have struggled to identify a consistent "Obama Doctrine" in foreign policy. Obama himself has claimed to support realism, unilateralism, and internationalism at various times. His actions, however, tell a different story. Time and again, Obama has expressed concern for the suffering of innocents, only to do little or nothing when the spotlight fades. In Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq, Obama has failed to follow through on his rhetoric, leaving allies to die and allowing adversaries to act with impunity. Obama is a master of emotional manipulation, focusing on his public image and short-term displays of force rather than the sustained action needed to effect real change. The true Obama Doctrine is one of popularity and appearances, and the result has been massive casualties and unpopularity.
