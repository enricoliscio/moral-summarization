Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Obama Doctrine. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the main points. The article is discussing how President Obama's foreign policy has been perceived as inconsistent and more about appearances than real action. It mentions that his policies have been labeled as "leading from behind" by critics and realism by allies. 

The article provides examples like Libya, Israel, Syria, Ukraine, Iran, Nigeria, and Iraq, where Obama's actions were either short-term or ineffective. For instance, in Syria, he set a red line for chemical weapons but didn't follow through. In Egypt, he supported the removal of Mubarak but didn't back the Egyptian military when they took action. The article also talks about his airstrikes against ISIS, which are seen as just another short-term measure.

The main argument is that Obama's approach is about manipulating emotions and media attention rather than making a real difference. He's good at making appearances and posturing but doesn't commit to long-term solutions, leading to more casualties and unpopularity. The summary needs to capture this essence without going into too much detail on each example.

I should structure the summary by first introducing the Obama Doctrine as being about appearances, then mention the examples briefly, and conclude with the impact of this approach. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise. I'll make sure to highlight the key points: inconsistency, focus on short-term actions, manipulation of emotions, and the resulting consequences like high casualties and unpopularity.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with the definition of the Obama Doctrine as per the article, then list a few examples, and end with the outcomes. That should cover the main points effectively.

SUMMARY: The article critiques the Obama Doctrine, arguing that it prioritizes appearances over substance in foreign policy. Obama's approach, often described as "leading from behind" by critics, has been marked by inconsistent actions, such as short-term military interventions in Libya and Iraq, and inaction in Syria, Ukraine, and Iran. The article claims that Obama uses emotional appeals and media posturing to manipulate public sentiment, without committing to long-term solutions. Examples include his failure to address the suffering in Syria, where over 200,000 have died, and his ineffective response to crises in Egypt, Nigeria, and Ukraine. The author concludes that Obama's focus on popularity and emotional manipulation, rather than decisive leadership, has led to widespread casualties and a lack of meaningful change. END OF SUMMARY.
