SUMMARY: For years, observers have struggled to define a clear "Obama Doctrine" on foreign policy. While the president has claimed to support unilateralism and internationalism in the service of human rights and diplomacy, his actions have often been inconsistent and ineffective. Obama has a talent for emotional manipulation, expressing outrage and determination in the face of global crises but failing to follow through with meaningful action. From Egypt and Iran to Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, Obama has offered little more than brief shows of force and empty words. His recent decision to launch airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq follows the same pattern: a temporary display of concern that quickly fades as the world's attention turns elsewhere. The "Obama Doctrine," it seems, is little more than a pursuit of popularity and a preference for appearances over substantive action, resulting in massive casualties and a dangerous lack of leadership on the world stage.
END OF SUMMARY.
