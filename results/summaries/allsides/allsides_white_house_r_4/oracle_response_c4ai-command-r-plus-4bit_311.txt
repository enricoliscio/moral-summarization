SUMMARY: For years, there has been much speculation about the so-called Obama Doctrine, with commentators attempting to identify a consistent approach to foreign policy. However, Obama's actions in recent international crises suggest a pattern of superficial concern for the suffering of innocents, coupled with a lack of sustained commitment to meaningful action. Obama has expressed outrage at events such as the ouster of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, the treatment of democracy protesters in Iran, Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea, Boko Haram's kidnapping in Nigeria, and the use of weapons of mass destruction in Syria. Yet, in each case, his response has been inadequate and ineffective, amounting to little more than brief shows of force and empty posturing. The author argues that Obama is a master emotional manipulator who cares more about appearances and popularity than taking the lead in addressing global issues. This approach has resulted in massive unpopularity and countless casualties, as Obama fails to confront evil and instead leaves erstwhile allies to die.
