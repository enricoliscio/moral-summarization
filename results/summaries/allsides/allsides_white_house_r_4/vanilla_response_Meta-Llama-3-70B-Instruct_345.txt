SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine, a term used to describe President Obama's foreign policy approach, has been difficult to define due to its inconsistencies. However, with his latest decision to launch airstrikes against ISIS, it has become clear that the Obama Doctrine is to pretend to care about suffering innocents when it makes headlines, but ignore it otherwise. Obama is a master of emotional manipulation, using his tone and attitude to sway public opinion, but rarely taking effective action to combat evil. He has a history of abandoning innocent lives in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, often expressing outrage but taking little to no action. The Obama Doctrine is more about appearances than realities, prioritizing popularity over taking lasting action to effect change. This approach has led to massive casualties and unpopularity.

END OF SUMMARY.
