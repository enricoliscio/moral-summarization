SUMMARY: For years, observers have struggled to define a consistent "Obama Doctrine" on foreign policy. Obama has claimed to support unilateralism for human rights and internationalism for diplomacy, but his policies have been inconsistent. Critics argue that Obama prioritizes appearance over reality and is a master emotional manipulator who feigns concern for innocent victims of atrocities. They accuse him of making short-term, ineffective deployments of power and abandoning allies when convenient. Examples include Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and Iraq. Obama expresses outrage but fails to take decisive, sustained action to address these crises, resulting in massive casualties. The true Obama Doctrine, they argue, is popularity and posturing rather than meaningful commitment.
END OF SUMMARY.
