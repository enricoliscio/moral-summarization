SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine is revealed to be a pretentious and ineffective approach to foreign policy, where the President only appears to care about suffering innocents when it's convenient for him. He is a master of emotional manipulation, using his tone and attitude to sway public opinion, but ultimately does little to combat evil. His policies are marked by short-term and ineffective deployments of power, followed by abandonment of those in need. This pattern is evident in his handling of crises in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, Syria, and now Iraq, where he drops bombs and blusters, only to move on to the next crisis, leaving allies to die. The Obama Doctrine is driven by a desire for popularity rather than a genuine commitment to leading and effecting change. This approach has resulted in massive casualties and unpopularity. The President's lack of true concern for human suffering has been exposed, revealing a dangerous combination of emotional manipulation and foreign policy incompetence.

END OF SUMMARY.
