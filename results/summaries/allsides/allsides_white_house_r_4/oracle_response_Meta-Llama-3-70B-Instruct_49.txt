SUMMARY:

The Obama Doctrine is revealed to be a facade, where President Obama pretends to care about the suffering of innocents when it hits the headlines, but ignores it the rest of the time. He is a master emotional manipulator, capable of achieving effective posturing when it comes to the suffering of innocents, but ultimately doesn't truly care. His policies are marked by short-term and ineffective deployments of power, leaving innocents to die. This is evident in his handling of crises in Egypt, Iran, Ukraine, Nigeria, and Syria, where he has expressed outrage but taken little to no action. In Iraq, he will drop a few bombs and bluster, but ultimately move on, leaving erstwhile allies to die. The Obama Doctrine is one of popularity over substance, where appearances matter more than realities. This dangerous combination has led to massive casualties and unpopularity.
