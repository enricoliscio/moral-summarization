SUMMARY:

House Republicans confronted Chairman Adam Schiff, urging him to resign due to his "incompatible" actions and "unethical" behavior in leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump. They claimed Schiff "abused" his position, "damaged" the integrity of the committee, and "undermined" faith in US government institutions. Schiff defended himself, listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and suspect foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of Trump campaign coordination with Russia. Republicans argued that Schiff's actions were "immoral," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt," and that he continued to "promote a demonstrably false narrative" despite Mueller's findings. Schiff reacted angrily, stating that he thinks it's "okay" how Trump and his associates interacted with Russians during the campaign, but he doesn't, and that it's "immoral," "unethical," and "corrupt." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats." The confrontation highlights the deepening partisan divide in the House Intelligence Committee.
