SUMMARY: Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, calling for his resignation as House Intelligence Committee Chairman, citing his conspiracy charges against President Trump and his associates. They argued that Schiff's actions were "incompatible" with his duties and that they had "no faith" in his ability to discharge his responsibilities effectively. Schiff defended himself by listing inappropriate contacts between Trump's team and foreigners but failed to provide evidence of collusion. The Republicans' letter accused Schiff of promoting a "false narrative," abusing his power, and damaging the committee's integrity. It highlighted Mueller's findings, which refuted Schiff's claims of collusion. Schiff reacted angrily, stating that he found the interactions between Trump's campaign and Russians "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." He vowed to continue investigating, asserting that Trump and his associates may be "compromised." Rep. Michael Turner compared Schiff to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of misrepresenting information and abusing his power. The summary concludes with Turner's criticism of Schiff's decision to add prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts to his staff, alluding to the controversial Steele dossier.
END OF SUMMARY.
