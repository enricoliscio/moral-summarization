Alright, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. My task is to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. The user mentioned that I should look for single words with moral connotations. So, I'll go through each paragraph and pick out words that carry a positive or negative moral judgment.

Starting from the beginning, Republicans confront Schiff for "leveling conspiracy charges." "Conspiracy" is a morally charged term, implying wrongdoing. Then, they say they have "no faith" in his ability, which is a negative moral assessment. Schiff defends himself by listing "inappropriate contacts," another negative term. The article mentions that Schiff didn't list any instances of "coordinating" with Russia, which implies a failure to act responsibly.

The letter from Republicans accuses Schiff of "abusing his position" and "promoting false information," both strong negative terms. They also say his actions are "incompatible" with his duties, another negative moral judgment. Schiff reacts angrily, listing events like Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, which he deems "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." These are all strong negative moral words.

Pelosi supports Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats," which is a dismissive term, though not as strong. Republicans counter by saying the Clinton campaign was involved in "collusion," another negative term. They also mention Schiff's "abuse" of power and "misrepresentation" of information, both negative. Comparing him to McCarthy is a moral comparison, implying witch-hunting. The Steele dossier is called a "hoax," a negative term, and Mueller's findings "refute" Schiff's claims, which is a negative assessment.

Putting it all together, I need to list each of these words as STEP 1. Then, in the summary, I have to include as many of these as possible without making it too long. The summary should capture the essence of the conflict, highlighting the moral framing from both sides.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key moral terms. It should reflect that Schiff is being accused of promoting false information and abusing his position, while he counters with the morality of Trump's associates' actions. Pelosi supports Schiff, and Republicans compare him to McCarthy, emphasizing their moral stances.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation, his defense with moral condemnations, Pelosi's support, and the Republican counterarguments using terms like collusion, abuse, and McCarthyism. This way, the summary preserves the moral framing as per the user's request.

### SUMMARY:
Republicans demanded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff resign, accusing him of abusing his position to promote false information about President Trump's alleged collusion with Russia. Schiff defended himself by highlighting morally questionable interactions between Trump associates and foreign individuals, though he failed to provide evidence of direct coordination with Russia. Republicans pointed to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which refuted Schiff's claims of collusion, and accused him of misrepresenting classified information. Schiff, however, condemned Trump's associates' actions as immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, insisting their interactions with Russians were corrupt. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, while Republicans likened him to McCarthy, criticizing his tactics as McCarthyism. The conflict underscores deep divisions over the morality of Trump's campaign ties to Russia and the integrity of the investigation.  
END OF SUMMARY.
