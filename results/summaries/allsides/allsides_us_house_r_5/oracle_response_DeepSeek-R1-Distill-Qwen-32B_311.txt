Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they are a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the author's moral perspective.

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. It's about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, over his handling of the Russia probe. They're accusing him of not having the integrity to continue his role, citing Mueller's findings that didn't support collusion. Schiff is defending himself by listing instances of interactions between Trump associates and Russians, but Republicans argue he's promoting false narratives.

The author used specific morally charged words like "discharge," "interference," "immoral," etc. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be concise, under 200 words.

I'll start by outlining the key events: Republicans urging Schiff to resign, his defense, Mueller's findings, the accusations of false narratives, and the comparison to McCarthy. I should make sure to use the moral terms to frame the narrative as the author did.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and captures the essence of both sides. Schiff's actions are portrayed as unethical and corrupt by Republicans, while he and Pelosi defend him as necessary oversight. The comparison to McCarthyism adds a moral dimension, so that should be included.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the confrontation, then Schiff's defense, followed by Republican accusations, Mueller's findings, and the implications on the committee's integrity. Ending with Pelosi's support and the overall impact on public trust would wrap it up nicely.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral language and keep it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and includes the necessary terms without being redundant.

SUMMARY: Republicans demanded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff resign, citing his inability to "discharge" his duties responsibly due to his "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic" actions in promoting a "false narrative" about Russian election interference. Schiff defended himself by highlighting interactions between Trump associates and suspect foreigners, though he failed to provide evidence of collusion with Russia, as Mueller's findings refuted such claims. Republicans accused Schiff of "abusing" his position, "damaging" the committee's integrity, and "undermining" faith in U.S. institutions. Schiff, however, persisted in "investigating" counterintelligence issues, asserting that Trump's associates' actions were "corrupt." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism as "scaredy-cats." Republicans countered that any collusion was on the Clinton campaign's side, paying for disinformation, and accused Schiff of "chasing" a "false narrative" akin to McCarthyism. They criticized his reliance on the Steele dossier, which Mueller rejected, and accused him of "hurling" conspiracy charges without merit. END OF SUMMARY.
