SUMMARY: House Republicans have called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, citing his unfounded conspiracy charges against President Trump and his associates. In a letter, they stated that they had "no faith" in Schiff's ability to fulfill his duties as chairman. Schiff defended himself by listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of collusion. The Republicans argued that the Mueller investigation had concluded without finding any collusion, and that Schiff's continued promotion of a "demonstrably false narrative" was alarming. They also compared Schiff's actions to McCarthyism, referring to the anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s. Schiff, however, remained defiant, tweeting that he believed the interactions between Trump associates and Russians were immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism as scare tactics. The Republicans also criticized Schiff for hiring a former mob prosecutor as his chief investigator and his endorsement of the Steele dossier, which they considered a Kremlin hoax.
END OF SUMMARY.
