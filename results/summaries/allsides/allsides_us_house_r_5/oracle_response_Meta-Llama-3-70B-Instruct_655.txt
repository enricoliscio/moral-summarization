SUMMARY:

House Republicans have lost faith in Rep. Adam Schiff's ability to discharge his duties as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his two years of leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump. Schiff defended himself by listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and suspect foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of Trump people coordinating in Russian election interference. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as Chairman, and that he has abused his power to promote a false narrative of collusion. Schiff, however, believes that Trump's associates' interactions with Russians during the campaign were immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. The Republican criticism comes after special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found no evidence of Trump associates conspiring with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Schiff's continued investigation and promotion of a "demonstrably false narrative" has damaged the integrity of the Committee and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions.
