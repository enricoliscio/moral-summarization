SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing his two-year crusade against President Trump and his associates, which they claim has damaged the integrity of the Committee and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions. Schiff has been accused of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" of Trump-Russia collusion, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings that there was no evidence of such collusion. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are "incompatible with his duty" as Chairman and that he has "abused his position to knowingly promote false information." Schiff has defended himself, calling Trump's interactions with Russians "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has supported Schiff, calling Republican critics "scaredy-cats."
