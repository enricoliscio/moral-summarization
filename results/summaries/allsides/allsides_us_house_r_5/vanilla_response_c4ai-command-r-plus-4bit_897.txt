SUMMARY: Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee confronted Chairman Adam Schiff, urging him to resign due to his conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited the findings of the Mueller investigation, which refuted claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff defended himself by listing inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreigners but failed to provide evidence of coordination in election interference. The Republicans' letter accused Schiff of promoting false narratives and abusing his position. Rep. Michael Turner compared Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, known for his anti-communist allegations. Turner also criticized Schiff for hiring prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts, including Daniel Goldman, who endorsed the Steele dossier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism. Republicans shifted the focus to the Clinton campaign's alleged collusion with Russians, claiming they paid middlemen to spread disinformation.
