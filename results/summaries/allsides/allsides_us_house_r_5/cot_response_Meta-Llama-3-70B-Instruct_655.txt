SUMMARY:
House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing his "incompatible" actions and lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties. Schiff has been accused of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" of collusion between Trump associates and Russia, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings to the contrary. Schiff defended himself, listing instances of Trump associates' interactions with Russians, which he deemed "immoral", "unethical", and "unpatriotic". Republicans argue that Schiff's actions have "damaged" the integrity of the Committee and "undermined" faith in US government institutions. The controversy has sparked comparisons to McCarthyism, with Rep. Michael Turner likening Schiff to Sen. Joseph McCarthy. END OF SUMMARY.
