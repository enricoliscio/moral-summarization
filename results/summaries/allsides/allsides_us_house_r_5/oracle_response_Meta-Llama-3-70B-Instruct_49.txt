SUMMARY:

Republicans have urged House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff to resign, citing a lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties due to his past actions promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Schiff defended himself by listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of coordination in Russian election interference. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as Chairman, and that he has abused his power to knowingly promote false information, damaging the integrity of the Committee and undermining faith in U.S. government institutions. Schiff, however, believes that Trump's associates' interactions with Russians during the campaign were immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, and that he will continue to investigate counterintelligence issues. The Republican criticism has been likened to McCarthyism, with Schiff being accused of chasing after Russian collusion and adding prosecutors to his staff to promote a false narrative.
