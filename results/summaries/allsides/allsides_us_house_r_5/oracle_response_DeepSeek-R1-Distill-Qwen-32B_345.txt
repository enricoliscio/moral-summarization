Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also provided a list of morally charged words that the author used. My first step is to read through the article thoroughly to understand the context and the key points.

I notice that the article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, over his handling of the Russia probe. They're accusing him of not properly discharging his duties because they don't have faith in him. Schiff is defending himself by citing interactions between Trump associates and foreigners, but without concrete evidence of collusion, which Mueller didn't find.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like 'discharge,' 'interference,' 'immoral,' 'unethical,' etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Republicans and Schiff, their accusations, and his counterarguments. I should also mention Mueller's findings and the comparison to McCarthyism, as these add moral weight.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Republicans urging Schiff to resign, his defense, Mueller's conclusions, Pelosi's support, and the accusations of promoting false narratives. Then, I'll weave in the moral terms to reflect the author's framing.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential elements without getting too detailed. I should ensure that each morally charged word is appropriately placed to maintain the original tone and message.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it flows well and accurately represents both sides of the argument, preserving the moral implications as the author intended.

SUMMARY: Republicans have demanded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of failing to discharge his duties responsibly. They argue his actions are incompatible with his role, citing his continued promotion of a narrative of Russian collusion despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings that no conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia existed. Schiff defended himself by listing interactions between Trump associates and foreign individuals, though he couldnâ€™t provide evidence of direct collusion. Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Michael Turner, accused Schiff of abusing his position to promote false information, damaging the committee's integrity, and undermining faith in U.S. institutions. They likened him to McCarthyism, charging him with chasing unfounded allegations. Schiff, however, declared Trump's interactions with Russians immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, supported Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism as fear-driven. The conflict highlights deep divisions over the Russia probe and its implications for U.S. governance. END OF SUMMARY.
