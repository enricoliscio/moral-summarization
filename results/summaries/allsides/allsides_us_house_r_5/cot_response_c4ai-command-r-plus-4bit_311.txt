SUMMARY:
Republicans are calling for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of "abusing his power" and "misrepresenting information" during his investigation into President Trump's alleged collusion with Russia. In a letter to Schiff, they stated that they had "no faith" in his ability to discharge his duties as Chairman, citing Mueller's findings that refuted Schiff's claims of collusion. Schiff defended himself by listing Trump associates' inappropriate contacts with Russians, including the infamous Trump Tower meeting and Manafort's provision of polling data to Ukraine. He later tweeted that he found the interactions between Trump's campaign and Russia "immoral", "unethical", "unpatriotic", and "corrupt". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism as "scaredy-cats". Republicans also likened Schiff to McCarthy, accusing him of "chasing" Russian collusion in the same way McCarthy chased Russian communists. They criticized his decision to hire prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts, pointing to his endorsement of the Steele dossier, which Mueller effectively rejected.
