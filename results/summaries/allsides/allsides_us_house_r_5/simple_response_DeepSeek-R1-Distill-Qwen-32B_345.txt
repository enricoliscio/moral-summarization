Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, for his handling of the Russia probe. They're urging him to resign, citing his past claims about Trump associates colluding with Russia, which Mueller's investigation didn't support. Schiff defended his actions, listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners but not finding any collusion. Republicans argue that Schiff's continued investigation is based on false narratives, comparing him to McCarthy. Pelosi supports Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats." The article highlights the moral implications, with Schiff accusing Trump's associates of immoral and unethical actions, while Republicans accuse Schiff of abusing his position.

I need to capture the conflict, the accusations from both sides, and the moral framing. I should mention Schiff's defense, the Mueller report's findings, the comparison to McCarthy, and the support from Pelosi. Also, note that Republicans believe the Clinton campaign was involved in collusion, and Schiff's team includes someone who endorsed the Steele dossier, which Mueller rejected.

I'll structure the summary to include the main points: Republicans urging Schiff's resignation, his defense, Mueller's findings, the moral accusations, the McCarthy comparison, Pelosi's support, and the Republican counter-accusations. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral elements are clear.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is included without exceeding the word limit. I'll start by stating the confrontation, then Schiff's defense, Republicans' arguments, Pelosi's support, and the implications of the Steele dossier. I'll ensure the moral framing is preserved, highlighting Schiff's accusations and Republicans' counter-accusations about false narratives and McCarthyism.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Republicans have demanded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of mishandling the Russia probe and promoting false narratives about collusion between Trump associates and Russia. Schiff defended his work, citing contacts between Trump associates and foreign entities, though he did not provide evidence of collusion. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found no evidence of such collusion, a point emphasized by Republicans in their criticism. Schiff, however, has continued to investigate, asserting that Trump's interactions with Russians were immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Republicans likened Schiff to McCarthy, accusing him of abusing his position to promote false information. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing Republican concerns. The dispute highlights ongoing partisan divisions over the Russia probe and its implications for U.S. governance. END OF SUMMARY.
