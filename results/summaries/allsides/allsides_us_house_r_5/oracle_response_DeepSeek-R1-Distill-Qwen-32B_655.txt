Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, over his handling of the Russia probe. They're accusing him of not having the right to continue as chairman because they don't trust his ability to do his job properly.

The author uses words like "discharge," "interference," "immoral," "unethical," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. I should start by identifying the key events: Republicans urging Schiff to resign, his defense using supposed contacts but not proving collusion, the Mueller report findings, and the comparison to McCarthyism. Also, the mention of the Steele dossier and the addition of prosecutors to the staff are important.

I should structure the summary to include Schiff's actions, the Republicans' accusations, the Mueller report's conclusion, and the moral terms used. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. I'll also mention Pelosi's support and the Republicans' counterarguments about Clinton's campaign. I should ensure that each morally framed word is appropriately placed to reflect the author's perspective.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each point is covered and the moral terms are integrated naturally. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure all key points and moral framing are present.

SUMMARY:  
Republicans urged House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to resign, claiming his actions are incompatible with his duty to discharge oversight of the intelligence community. They criticized his continued promotion of a narrative of Russian collusion, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings that no conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia was found. Schiff defended himself by listing inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreign actors, though he did not provide evidence of coordination in Russian election interference. Republicans accused him of abusing his position to promote false information, damaging the committee's integrity, and undermining faith in U.S. institutions. They likened him to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of chasing Russian collusion without evidence. Schiff, however, called Trump's interactions with Russians immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. He emphasized the need to investigate counterintelligence issues, such as whether Trump or his associates are compromised by a hostile foreign power. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, while Republicans argued that any collusion was on the Clinton campaign's side. The debate highlights ongoing divisions over the Russia probe and the integrity of the investigation process.  
END OF SUMMARY.
