SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his power and promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about President Trump's alleged collusion with Russia. Schiff defended himself, listing instances of Trump associates' contacts with foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of coordination with Russia in the 2016 election. Republicans cited Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which cleared Trump associates of conspiring with Russia. Schiff reacted angrily, calling Trump's actions "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats." The GOP accused Schiff of continuing to promote a false narrative, damaging the committee's integrity, and undermining faith in government institutions. Rep. Michael Turner likened Schiff to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of abusing his power and misrepresenting information.
