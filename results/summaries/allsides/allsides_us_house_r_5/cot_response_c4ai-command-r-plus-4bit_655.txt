SUMMARY:
Republicans are demanding the resignation of Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, for his persistent conspiracy accusations against President Trump and his associates. They argue that Schiff's actions are "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "corrupt." In a letter to Schiff, Rep. Devin Nunes and other GOP members expressed their lack of faith in his ability to fulfill his duties due to his "abuse" of power and "misrepresented" information. They cited Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which refuted claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Despite this, Schiff continues to assert the existence of "significant evidence of collusion." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism. Republicans also drew comparisons between Schiff and Sen. Joseph McCarthy, known for his anti-communist rhetoric and abuse of power. They criticized Schiff's decision to hire prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts, including Daniel Goldman, who endorsed the discredited Steele dossier. The GOP letter concluded that Schiff had "damaged the integrity of this Committee and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions."
