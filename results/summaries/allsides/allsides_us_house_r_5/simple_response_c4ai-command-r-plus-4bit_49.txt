SUMMARY: Republicans have called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false information and abusing his power in his investigation into President Trump's alleged collusion with Russia. Schiff has defended himself by listing inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but has not provided evidence of direct coordination in election interference. In a letter to Schiff, Republicans cited the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who ended his investigation without finding evidence of collusion. They criticized Schiff's continued assertion of "significant evidence of collusion," calling it a "demonstrably false narrative." Rep. Devin Nunes, the previous chairman, and other GOP members expressed a lack of faith in Schiff's ability to discharge his duties, urging him to resign. Schiff, however, remains defiant, stating that he finds the interactions between Trump's associates and Russians immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has supported Schiff amid the criticism. Republicans have also drawn comparisons between Schiff and Sen. Joseph McCarthy, known for his anti-communist witch hunts in the 1950s, accusing Schiff of abusing his power and misrepresenting information.
END OF SUMMARY.
