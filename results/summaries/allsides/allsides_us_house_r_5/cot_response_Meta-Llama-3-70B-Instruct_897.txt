SUMMARY:
House Republicans confronted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff, urging him to resign due to his "incompatible" actions and "false" narrative on Trump-Russia collusion. Schiff defended himself, listing Trump associates' "inappropriate" contacts with foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of Russian election interference. Republicans accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and "abusing" his position to spread "false information." Schiff countered, calling Trump's actions "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." The clash highlights the deep partisan divide on the issue, with Republicans likening Schiff to Sen. Joseph McCarthy for his "McCarthyism" tactics. END OF SUMMARY.
