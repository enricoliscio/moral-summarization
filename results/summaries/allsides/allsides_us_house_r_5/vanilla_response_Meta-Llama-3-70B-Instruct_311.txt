SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his power and promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" of Trump-Russia collusion. In a letter, Republicans cited Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings that there was no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. Schiff defended himself by listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but did not provide evidence of coordination in Russian election interference. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions have damaged the integrity of the committee and undermined faith in US government institutions. Schiff has hired a former federal prosecutor as his chief investigator, who has endorsed the disputed Christopher Steele dossier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats."
