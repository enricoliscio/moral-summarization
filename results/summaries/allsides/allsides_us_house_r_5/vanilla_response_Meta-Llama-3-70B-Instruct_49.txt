SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to resign, citing a lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties. This comes after two years of Schiff leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump. Schiff defended himself by listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreign nationals, but failed to provide evidence of Trump campaign coordination with Russia in the 2016 election. Republicans pointed to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which cleared Trump associates of conspiring with Russia. Schiff has continued to push for further investigation, which Republicans claim is a promotion of a "demonstrably false narrative." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats." The controversy has led to comparisons between Schiff and Sen. Joseph McCarthy, with Republicans accusing Schiff of abusing his power and promoting false information.
