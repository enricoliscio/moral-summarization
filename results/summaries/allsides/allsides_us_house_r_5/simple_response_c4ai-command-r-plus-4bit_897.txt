SUMMARY: Republicans have called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump without evidence for two years. In a letter to Schiff, they stated that they had "no faith" in his ability to perform his duties as Chairman and that his actions were "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt." Schiff defended himself by listing instances of inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and Russians, such as the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. He also noted that Paul Manafort provided polling data to Russia-linked officials and that Roger Stone briefly exchanged emails with a Russian intelligence operative. Schiff believes that these actions are a threat to national security and should be investigated further. Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism as baseless. Republicans, however, continue to allege that it was the Clinton campaign that colluded with Russia, and they argue that Schiff is abusing his power by promoting a "false narrative." They have compared his actions to McCarthyism, suggesting that Schiff is engaging in a witch-hunt similar to that of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.
