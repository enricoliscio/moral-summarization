SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to resign, citing a lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties. The Republicans accuse Schiff of leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump for two years without evidence of Russian election interference. Schiff defended himself by listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of coordination with Russia. The Republicans point to the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which found no evidence of Trump associates conspiring with Russia. Schiff has reopened a Russia probe, which Republicans argue is based on a "demonstrably false narrative." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats." The dispute has led to accusations of McCarthyism and abuse of power.

END OF SUMMARY.
