SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to resign, citing a lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties. The Republicans accuse Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings to the contrary. Schiff defended himself, listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of coordination with Russia. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions have damaged the integrity of the committee and undermined faith in US government institutions. Schiff has reopened a Russia probe and has hired a former federal prosecutor to lead the investigation. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have defended Schiff, with Pelosi calling Republican critics "scaredy-cats".
