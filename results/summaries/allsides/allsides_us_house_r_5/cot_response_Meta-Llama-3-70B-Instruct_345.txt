SUMMARY:
House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his "immoral" and "unethical" behavior in leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump. Schiff defended himself, listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and suspect foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of Russian election interference. Republicans accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and "knowingly" spreading misinformation, which has "damaged" the integrity of the committee and "undermined" faith in U.S. government institutions. Schiff reacted angrily, calling the Republicans' actions "scaredy-cats" and stating that he thinks Trump's interactions with Russians during the campaign are "immoral", "unethical", and "unpatriotic". The controversy highlights the deepening partisan divide in the House. END OF SUMMARY.
