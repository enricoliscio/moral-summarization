SUMMARY: Republicans confronted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, calling for his resignation due to his persistent conspiracy allegations against President Trump. They cited Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which refuted claims of Trump-Russia collusion, and accused Schiff of abusing his power and promoting false information. In response, Schiff listed instances of inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and Russians, deeming them immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. He defended his decision to reopen the Russia probe, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported him amid the criticism. Republicans also drew parallels between Schiff and Senator Joseph McCarthy, known for his anti-communist witch hunts in the 1950s. They criticized Schiff's hiring of prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts and his endorsement of the discredited Steele dossier. The letter from Republicans expressed a loss of faith in Schiff's ability to lead the committee effectively and impartially.
