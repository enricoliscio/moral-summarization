SUMMARY: House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, urging him to resign as House Intelligence Committee Chairman due to his conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited Mueller's findings, which refuted Schiff's claims of collusion between Trump associates and Russia. In response, Schiff defended his actions, listing inappropriate contacts between Trump Jr., Manafort, and Stone with Russians. He deemed these interactions as immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Republicans criticized Schiff for promoting a false narrative and abusing his power, drawing comparisons to McCarthyism. They questioned his decision to add prosecutors to his staff instead of intelligence analysts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism as baseless. The letter from Republicans accused Schiff of damaging the committee's integrity and undermining faith in U.S. institutions.
