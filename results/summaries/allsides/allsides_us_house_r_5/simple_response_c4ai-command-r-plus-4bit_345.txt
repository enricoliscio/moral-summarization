SUMMARY: House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, for his persistent conspiracy allegations against President Trump, calling for his resignation due to their lack of confidence in his ability to fulfill his duties impartially. Mr. Schiff defended his actions by citing alleged inappropriate interactions between Trump associates and foreigners, despite the absence of evidence of direct collusion with Russia in the Mueller report. The Republicans' letter to Mr. Schiff highlighted the contradiction between his claims and the Mueller report's findings, accusing him of promoting false information and abusing his position. Mr. Schiff responded angrily, stating his belief that the interactions were immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. He received support from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who dismissed the Republican criticism. The Republicans also drew parallels between Mr. Schiff's actions and McCarthyism, suggesting he was engaging in a witch-hunt. The summary highlights the ethical and moral implications of the alleged interactions and the subsequent actions of Mr. Schiff, as perceived by the Republicans.
