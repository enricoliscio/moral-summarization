Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, over his handling of the Russia probe. They're asking him to resign because they don't trust his ability to do his job properly. Schiff, a Democrat, is accused of promoting conspiracy theories against Trump without solid evidence.

Okay, so the key points are: Republicans are urging Schiff to resign, citing his past actions and Mueller's findings. Schiff defended himself by mentioning contacts between Trump associates and Russians but didn't provide evidence of coordination in election interference. The letter from Republicans references Mueller's report, which didn't find collusion. Schiff held a hearing with witnesses but didn't find any evidence of information being passed. He later tweeted his strong disapproval of Trump's interactions with Russians. Pelosi supports Schiff, calling Republicans "scared." Republicans counter by suggesting collusion was from the Clinton campaign. They also criticized Schiff for adding prosecutors instead of analysts and for promoting the Steele dossier, which Mueller dismissed.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main actions, the arguments from both sides, and the key players involved. Make sure to mention Schiff's defense, the Mueller report, Pelosi's support, and the Republican accusations. Also, note the comparison to McCarthy and the Steele dossier.

Let me structure this: Start with Republicans urging Schiff to resign, their reasons based on Mueller's findings. Then Schiff's defense and the hearing. Pelosi's support. Republicans' counterarguments about Clinton campaign collusion and the Steele dossier. Mention the comparison to McCarthy and the staff changes. Conclude with the ongoing conflict.

I should keep each sentence concise and ensure all main points are covered without getting too detailed. Avoiding jargon and keeping it clear. Make sure the flow is logical, moving from the confrontation to the arguments and reactions.

Now, putting it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and covers all essential aspects without unnecessary details. Double-check to include Schiff's tweet and the specifics about the Steele dossier and Mueller's dismissal of it.
