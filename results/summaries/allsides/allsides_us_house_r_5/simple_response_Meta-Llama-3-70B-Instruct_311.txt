SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing his two-year crusade against President Trump and his associates, which they claim has damaged the integrity of the committee and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions. Schiff has repeatedly accused Trump associates of conspiring with Russia, but has failed to provide evidence of such collusion. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty as Chairman and that he has abused his power by promoting a false narrative. Schiff, however, remains defiant, calling Trump's interactions with Russians "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats." The moral framing of this issue is clear: Schiff and Democrats see Trump's actions as a threat to American democracy, while Republicans see Schiff's actions as a witch hunt that undermines trust in government institutions.

END OF SUMMARY.
