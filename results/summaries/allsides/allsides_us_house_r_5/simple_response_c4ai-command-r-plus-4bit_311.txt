SUMMARY: Republicans confronted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, calling for his resignation due to his conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Schiff defended himself by listing inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of collusion. Republicans accused Schiff of abusing his power and promoting false information, damaging the integrity of the Committee. Schiff reacted angrily, tweeting that he found the interactions between Trump associates and Russians immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism. Republicans shifted blame to the Clinton campaign, accusing them of collusion with the Kremlin. They criticized Schiff's decision to hire a prosecutor instead of an intelligence analyst and his endorsement of the Steele dossier, which Republicans view as a Kremlin hoax.
