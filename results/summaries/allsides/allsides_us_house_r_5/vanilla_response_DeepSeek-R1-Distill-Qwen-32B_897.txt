Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, over his handling of the Russia probe. They're urging him to resign because they don't trust his ability to do his job properly.

Schiff is a Democrat from California. He's been leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's associates and Russia. The Republicans are upset because Schiff hasn't found any direct coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, despite what he claimed earlier. They're pointing out that Robert Mueller's investigation didn't find any collusion either.

Devin Nunes, the previous chairman, and other GOP members sent a letter to Schiff. They argue that his actions are incompatible with his role as chairman and that he's promoting false information. They even compared him to Joseph McCarthy, which is a strong criticism.

Schiff defended himself by listing instances where Trump associates had questionable contacts with Russians, like Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and Manafort's dealings. He called these actions immoral and unethical. However, he didn't present any evidence of actual collusion, which is what Mueller found.

Nancy Pelosi supports Schiff, calling the Republicans "scared." Republicans, on the other hand, suggest that any collusion was on the Clinton side, with her campaign possibly involving Russian disinformation.

The summary needs to capture the main points: the confrontation, the reasons Republicans are upset, Schiff's defense, the Mueller findings, and the broader implications of the conflict. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and neutral.

Let me structure it: start with the Republicans confronting Schiff, their reasons, Schiff's defense, mention Mueller's findings, the comparison to McCarthy, Pelosi's support, and the Republicans' counter-accusations about Clinton.

I need to make sure I include all these elements without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count as I draft.

Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" token at the beginning and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's concise and covers all key points.
