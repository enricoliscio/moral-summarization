SUMMARY: Republicans confronted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, urging him to resign due to his conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited Mueller's findings, which refuted Schiff's claims of collusion between Trump associates and Russia. Schiff defended himself by listing Trump associates' inappropriate contacts with foreigners and expressed his moral stance. He believes these actions were immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. Meanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism. Republicans also drew comparisons between Schiff and McCarthy, accusing him of abusing his power and promoting false narratives. They questioned his decision to add prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts to his staff.
