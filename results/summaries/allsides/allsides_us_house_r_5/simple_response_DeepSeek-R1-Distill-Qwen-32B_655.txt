Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff over his handling of the Russia probe. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Republicans are urging Schiff to resign, accusing him of promoting false information. They reference Mueller's findings that didn't support collusion. Schiff counters with examples like Trump Jr.'s meeting and Manafort's actions, calling them immoral. Pelosi supports Schiff, while Republicans compare him to McCarthy, suggesting he's using the same tactics. They also mention the Steele dossier, which Mueller dismissed as a hoax.

I need to make sure the summary captures the conflict between Schiff and Republicans, their accusations, his defense, and the moral implications each side presents. I'll structure it to show both perspectives: Republicans' claims of false narratives and Schiff's stance on ethics and national security. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.
