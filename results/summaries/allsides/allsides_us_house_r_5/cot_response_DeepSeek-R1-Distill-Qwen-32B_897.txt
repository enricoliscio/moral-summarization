Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a concise summary using those terms.

First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the context. It's about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff over his handling of the Russia probe. The key here is to find words that carry moral implications. Words like "confronted," "leveling," "charges," "resign," "faith," "inappropriate," "suspicious," "interference," "clearing," "compromised," "abused," "false," "integrity," "undermine," "damaged," "scaredy-cats," "collusion," "disinformation," "abuse," "misrepresented," "McCarthyism," "hoax," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," "immoral," "unethical." 

Next, I'll structure the summary. I need to include these moral terms and maintain the original framing. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Republicans demanding Schiff's resignation, his defense, the Mueller report's findings, the comparison to McCarthy, and the overall conflict over the probe's integrity.

I'll start by stating the Republicans' demand, then Schiff's response with specific examples. Mention the Mueller report and its implications. Then, the Republicans' accusation of false narrative and damaged integrity. Include the McCarthy comparison and the reference to the Steele dossier. Finally, wrap up with Schiff's stance and Pelosi's support.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key moral terms without being too lengthy. Let me piece it together, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  
Republicans demanded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, accusing him of abusing his position by promoting false narratives about Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Schiff defended his actions, citing instances of inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and suspicious foreigners, though he did not provide evidence of direct coordination with Russia. Republicans pointed to the Mueller report, which found no collusion, and accused Schiff of damaging the committee's integrity. Schiff, however, called Trump's interactions with Russians "immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic," while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended him. Republicans likened Schiff to McCarthy, accusing him of chasing a false narrative. They also criticized his reliance on the Steele dossier, which Mueller dismissed as a Kremlin hoax. The conflict highlights ongoing divisions over the probe's integrity and the moral implications of Trump's foreign interactions.
