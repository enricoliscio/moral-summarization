SUMMARY:

Republicans have lost faith in Rep. Adam Schiff's ability to discharge his duties as House Intelligence Committee Chairman, urging him to resign due to his past actions of leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump. Schiff defended himself by listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and suspect foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of Trump people coordinating with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are incompatible with his duty and have damaged the integrity of the Committee, undermining faith in U.S. government institutions. Schiff, however, maintains that Trump's interactions with Russians during the campaign were immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, and that he will continue to investigate counterintelligence issues. The Republican letter accuses Schiff of promoting a false narrative, abusing his position, and misrepresenting information. The moral tone of the debate is clear, with Schiff's critics accusing him of corruption and McCarthyism.
