SUMMARY: House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his repeated conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who concluded that there was no evidence of Trump associates colluding with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. Republicans accused Schiff of abusing his power and promoting false narratives, stating that his actions are "incompatible" with his duties as Chairman. Schiff defended himself by listing inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and Russians, such as the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. He later tweeted that he finds these interactions "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt." Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism. Republicans also brought up the Steele dossier, claiming it was a Kremlin hoax, while Schiff has added prosecutors to his staff, including one who endorsed the dossier. The letter from Republicans to Schiff expressed a lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties effectively and called for his resignation.
END OF SUMMARY.
