Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff over his handling of the Russia probe. I should start by identifying the key points: Republicans are urging Schiff to resign, citing his past claims and Mueller's findings. Schiff defends himself by listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners but didn't mention Russian election interference. The Republicans' letter accuses him of promoting false narratives and damaging the committee's integrity. Schiff responds by highlighting specific incidents like Trump Jr.'s meeting and Manafort's actions, calling them immoral. Pelosi supports Schiff, while Republicans argue that any collusion was on the Clinton side and compare Schiff to McCarthy. They also criticize his staff for focusing on prosecution rather than intelligence. I need to make sure the summary captures these elements, highlighting the moral arguments from both sides without taking sides. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the original moral framing. Let me structure it by starting with Republicans' actions, then Schiff's defense, the specific incidents he mentioned, the Republican accusations, Pelosi's support, the comparison to McCarthy, and the criticism of his staff. Make sure to include the moral terms like "immoral," "unethical," and "corrupt." Also, note Mueller's findings and the Steele dossier rejection. I'll need to paraphrase to keep it within the word limit, ensuring all critical points are covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Republicans have demanded the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false narratives about Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. They cited Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which did not support claims of conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia. Schiff defended his work, listing contacts between Trump associates and foreign individuals but did not provide evidence of Russian election interference. He called the actions of Trump associates "immoral, unethical, and corrupt." Republicans, led by Devin Nunes, argue that Schiff's continued investigation undermines the committee's integrity and have compared him to McCarthy for allegedly abusing his power. Schiff's hiring of a prosecutor, Daniel Goldman, who endorsed the Steele dossier (rejected by Mueller), further fueled Republican criticism. Pelosi defended Schiff, while Republicans claimed any collusion was on the Clinton side. END OF SUMMARY.
