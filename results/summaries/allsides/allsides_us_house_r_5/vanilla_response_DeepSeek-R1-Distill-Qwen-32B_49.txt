Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, because they want him to resign. They're upset with his handling of the Russia probe and his accusations against Trump. 

Schiff is a Democrat, and the Republicans, including Devin Nunes, sent a letter accusing him of not having the ability to do his job properly. They mention that Robert Mueller's investigation didn't find any collusion between Trump's associates and Russia. Schiff defended himself by bringing up some instances like Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and Manafort's actions, but he didn't provide evidence of direct coordination with Russia.

The Republicans argue that if there was any collusion, it was the Clinton campaign's fault, not Trump's. They also compare Schiff to McCarthy, implying he's making unfounded accusations. Schiff is adding prosecutors to his team, which the Republicans see as problematic because they believe he's pushing a false narrative.

I need to make sure the summary captures the main points: Republicans' demand for Schiff's resignation, their arguments based on Mueller's findings, Schiff's defense with specific examples, the comparison to McCarthy, and the political implications of the situation.

I should structure the summary to first mention the confrontation, then the reasons from both sides, and conclude with the political divide it reflects. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but include all key elements.

Let me start drafting: Republicans are demanding Schiff's resignation due to his handling of the Russia probe. They argue Mueller found no collusion. Schiff counters with specific examples but no direct evidence. Republicans claim Schiff is promoting false information, comparing him to McCarthy. Pelosi supports Schiff, while Republicans highlight their own investigation clearing Trump's campaign. The situation reflects the ongoing political divide.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
