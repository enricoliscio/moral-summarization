SUMMARY:

House Republicans confronted Chairman Adam Schiff, urging him to resign due to his "incompatible" actions and "abuse" of power in leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump. They claimed he has "no faith" in discharging his duties and has "damaged" the integrity of the committee. Schiff defended himself, listing Trump associates' "immoral" and "unethical" interactions with Russians, which he deemed "corrupt" and "unpatriotic." Republicans argued that Schiff's continued investigation is based on a "demonstrably false narrative" and that he has "misrepresented" information. They likened him to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of using a "McCarthyism" playbook. Schiff's hiring of a former federal prosecutor who endorsed the Christopher Steele dossier was also criticized. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats." The moral tone of the article emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior, integrity, and patriotism in political leadership.
