Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully.

The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman. They're asking him to resign because they don't trust him. Schiff is a Democrat, and he's been leading investigations into Trump's possible collusion with Russia. The Republicans, led by Devin Nunes, sent him a letter saying his actions are incompatible with his duties. They mention that Mueller's investigation didn't find collusion, so they think Schiff is promoting false information.

Schiff defended himself by listing contacts between Trump associates and Russians, like Trump Jr. meeting a Russian lawyer and Manafort dealing with Ukraine. He thinks these actions are immoral and unethical. Pelosi supports him, calling the Republicans "scaredy-cats." Republicans counter by saying the Clinton campaign paid for disinfo and that Schiff is using McCarthyist tactics, comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. They also mention Schiff's staff, including a prosecutor who supports the Steele dossier, which Mueller dismissed.

So, the summary needs to capture the conflict between Schiff and Republicans, their reasons, the Mueller findings, and the broader implications. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, focusing on the main points: Republicans urging Schiff's resignation, their reasons, Schiff's defense, Pelosi's support, and the comparison to McCarthy. Make sure it's clear and includes all key elements without getting too detailed.
