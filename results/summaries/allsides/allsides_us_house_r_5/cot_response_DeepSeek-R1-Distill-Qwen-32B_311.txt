Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed words, and then write a concise summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. The key points are about Republicans confronting Schiff over his handling of the Russia probe, his defense, and the moral implications each side is using. 

Looking for morally charged words, I see words like "conspiracy charges," "resign," "inappropriate contacts," "interference," "unconstitutional," "abuse," "false narrative," "scaredy-cats," "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," "abuse," "damage," "undermine," "McCarthyism," "hoax." These words carry strong moral judgments from both sides.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes these terms. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral accusations from each party. I'll start by stating Republicans urging Schiff's resignation, then mention Schiff's defense and his moral stance. I'll also include the Republican accusations against him, Pelosi's support, and the comparison to McCarthyism. Finally, I'll note the reference to the Steele dossier and Mueller's findings.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and captures the essence of the moral framing without being too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included with the appropriate moral terms.

**SUMMARY:**  
Republicans demanded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff resign, accusing him of abusing his position by promoting a "false narrative" of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Schiff defended his actions, citing "inappropriate contacts" between Trump associates and foreign entities, though he failed to provide evidence of direct coordination with Russia. Republicans pointed to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which cleared the Trump campaign of conspiracy, and accused Schiff of "damaging the integrity" of the committee. Schiff, however, called the interactions with Russians "immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism as "scaredy-cats." Republicans countered by likening Schiff to McCarthy, accusing him of "McCarthyism" and promoting a "hoax" through the Steele dossier, which Mueller largely discredited. The conflict highlights deep divisions over the Russia probe and its moral implications.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
