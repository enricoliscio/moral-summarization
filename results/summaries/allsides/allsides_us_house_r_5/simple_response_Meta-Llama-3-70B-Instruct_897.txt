SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to resign, citing a lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties. They accuse him of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" of Trump-Russia collusion, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings to the contrary. Schiff defended himself by listing instances of Trump associates' contacts with foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of coordination with Russia in the 2016 election. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are "incompatible with his duty" and have "damaged the integrity of this Committee" and "undermined faith in U.S. government institutions." Schiff, however, maintains that Trump's interactions with Russians during the campaign were "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." The moral framing of the issue is clear: Schiff sees Trump's actions as a breach of trust and ethics, while Republicans view Schiff's pursuit of the issue as a partisan witch hunt. END OF SUMMARY.
