SUMMARY: House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited Mueller's findings and the committee's previous clearance of the Trump campaign. Schiff defended himself by listing Trump associates' contacts with Russians but provided no evidence of collusion. Republicans accused Schiff of abusing his power and promoting false information. Rep. Devin Nunes, the previous chairman, and other GOP members sent a letter expressing their lack of faith in Schiff's ability to lead the committee effectively. Schiff responded angrily, listing instances of Trump associates' interactions with Russians and stating his belief that such actions were immoral and unpatriotic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, while Republicans pointed to the Clinton campaign's alleged collusion with Russians. Rep. Michael Turner compared Schiff to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, known for his anti-communist allegations. Turner also criticized Schiff's hiring of prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts. The dispute highlights the ongoing partisan divide regarding the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
