SUMMARY: House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his handling of the Russia investigation and conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, which found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and accused Schiff of promoting false information. Schiff defended himself by listing instances of inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and Russians, but did not provide evidence of coordination in election interference. The confrontation reflects ongoing partisan tensions surrounding the Russia investigation, with Republicans accusing Schiff of abusing his power and Democrats defending his actions as necessary oversight. The summary also mentions Speaker Nancy Pelosi's support for Schiff and Republicans' claims of Clinton campaign collusion with Russia.
