Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral terms involved.

The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, over his handling of the Russia probe. They're accusing him of not having the right qualifications and wanting him to resign. Schiff is a Democrat, and the Republicans, including Devin Nunes, are criticizing him for continuing to investigate despite Mueller's findings that didn't support collusion. 

The author uses words like "discharge," "interference," "actions incompatible," "oversight," "immoral," "unethical," "unpatriotic," "corrupt," and others. These words are key to the moral framing, so I need to include them in the summary.

I should start by stating that Republicans are urging Schiff to resign because they don't trust his ability to discharge his duties. Then, mention Schiff's defense by listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but not proving Russian interference. Highlight that Mueller found no collusion, and Republicans cleared the Trump campaign.

Schiff held a hearing, listing events like Trump Jr.'s meeting and Manafort's actions, calling them immoral, unethical, etc. Pelosi supports Schiff, while Republicans accuse him of promoting a false narrative, abusing his position, and damaging the committee's integrity. They compare him to McCarthy, chasing Russian collusion, and criticize his hires.

I need to make sure to include all these points concisely, using the moral terms provided. Let me structure this into a coherent summary, keeping it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Republicans are urging House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to resign, stating they have no faith in his ability to discharge his duties. They accuse him of promoting a false narrative about Russian interference in the 2016 election, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings that no collusion occurred. Schiff defended his actions, listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but failed to prove Russian interference. Republicans argue his actions are incompatible with his oversight responsibilities and have damaged the committee's integrity. Schiff called the interactions with Russians immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic, while Pelosi supported him. Republicans claim Schiff is abusing his power, misrepresenting classified information, and chasing a false narrative, akin to McCarthyism. They criticize his addition of prosecutors, like Daniel Goldman, who endorse the Steele dossier, which Mueller rejected as a Kremlin hoax. END OF SUMMARY.
