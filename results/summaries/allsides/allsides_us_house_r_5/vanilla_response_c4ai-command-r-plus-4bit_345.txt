SUMMARY: House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his conspiracy charges against President Trump and his associates. They cited Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which refuted claims of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Rep. Devin Nunes and other GOP members signed a letter expressing their lack of faith in Schiff's ability to discharge his duties. Schiff defended himself by listing instances of inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and foreigners but provided no evidence of coordination in Russian election interference. Schiff's decision to reopen a Russia probe was criticized, and he was compared to Sen. Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive pursuit of conspiracy theories. Republicans also questioned Schiff's hiring of additional prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts and his endorsement of the Steele dossier, which Mueller effectively rejected. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, dismissing the Republican criticism.
END OF SUMMARY.
