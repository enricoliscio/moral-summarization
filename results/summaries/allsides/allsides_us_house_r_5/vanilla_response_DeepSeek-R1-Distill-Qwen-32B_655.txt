Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

So, Republicans are telling Schiff to resign because they don't trust his handling of the Russia probe. They mention that Mueller found no collusion between Trump and Russia. Schiff is defending his actions, citing meetings with Russians but not finding any actual collusion. Pelosi supports him, while Republicans compare him to McCarthy. There's also a mention of Schiff hiring a prosecutor who believes in the Steele dossier, which Mueller dismissed.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the confrontation, Schiff's defense, Mueller's findings, Pelosi's support, and the McCarthy comparison. I should also note the Steele dossier and Republicans' counterpoints about Clinton. Make sure it's clear and concise, covering all key points without getting too detailed.

Schiff defended his work, highlighting alleged interactions between Trump associates and Russians, though no direct collusion was found. Pelosi supported Schiff, while Republicans likened him to McCarthy, accusing him of abusing his position. Schiff has added prosecutors to his team, including one who endorsed the Steele dossier, which Mueller largely rejected. Republicans argue the Clinton campaign colluded with Russia, not Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
