SUMMARY: 
Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his persistent conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings, which refuted Schiff's claims of collusion between Trump associates and Russia. In response, Schiff defended his actions, listing instances of questionable interactions between Trump's campaign and Russians, which he deemed immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, and corrupt. He stated that he would continue to investigate Trump's potential compromise by a hostile foreign power. Republicans criticized Schiff's conduct, likening it to McCarthyism and accusing him of abusing his power and misrepresenting information. They argued that if there was any collusion, it was the Clinton campaign's involvement with the Kremlin. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism. The dispute highlights the ongoing political divide regarding the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
