SUMMARY:
Republicans are calling for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his power and promoting false information. They argue that Schiff's continued assertions of collusion between Trump associates and Russia are incompatible with his duties as chairman and demonstrate a disregard for the findings of the Mueller investigation. Schiff defended himself by listing instances of inappropriate contacts between Trump's campaign and Russians, which he considers immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. He believes that the actions of Trump and his associates are corrupt and warrant further investigation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supports Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism as baseless. Republicans, however, maintain that any collusion in the election involved the Clinton campaign and spread disinformation. They accuse Schiff of engaging in McCarthyism and deliberately misleading the public. The conflict highlights the deep partisan divide surrounding the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
