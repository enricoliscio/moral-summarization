SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of abusing his power and promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" about President Trump's alleged collusion with Russia. Schiff has been a vocal critic of Trump, and Republicans argue that his actions are incompatible with his duty as chairman. They point to the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who concluded that there was no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Schiff, however, remains adamant that Trump's associates engaged in immoral and unpatriotic behavior by interacting with Russians during the campaign. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have rallied around Schiff, accusing Republicans of being "scaredy-cats" who are trying to distract from the real issue of Russian interference. The moral framing of the issue is clear: Schiff and Democrats see Trump's behavior as a threat to American values and institutions, while Republicans see Schiff's actions as a threat to the integrity of the intelligence committee and the government as a whole.
