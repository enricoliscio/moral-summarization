Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, over his handling of the Russia probe. They're asking him to resign because they don't trust his ability to do his job. Schiff is a Democrat, and the Republicans, including Devin Nunes, are accusing him of promoting false narratives about Trump's associates colluding with Russia. They reference Mueller's report, which didn't find collusion, and argue that Schiff's continued investigation is based on false information.

Schiff defends himself by listing instances where Trump associates had contacts with Russians, like Trump Jr. meeting with a Russian lawyer and Manafort's data exchange. He calls these actions immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Pelosi supports him, while Republicans compare him to McCarthy, suggesting he's on a witch hunt.

I need to capture the conflict between Schiff and Republicans, the accusations of false narratives, and the moral implications each side is using. I should mention Mueller's findings, the specific examples Schiff uses, and the comparison to McCarthy. Also, note that Republicans believe the Clinton campaign colluded with Russia, which Mueller didn't find. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral framing from both sides.

SUMMARY: Republicans criticized House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of promoting false narratives about collusion between President Trump's associates and Russia, despite Mueller's findings. Schiff defended his probe, citing Trump associates' contacts with Russians, like Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and Manafort's data exchange, calling their actions immoral and unethical. Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Michael Turner, demanded his resignation, accusing him of abusing his position and likening him to McCarthy, suggesting a witch hunt. They argue Schiff's continued investigation is based on false information, referencing the Steele dossier and Mueller's dismissal of collusion claims. Pelosi defended Schiff, while Republicans claimed the Clinton campaign colluded with Russia, which Mueller also refuted. The debate highlights conflicting moral perspectives on loyalty, integrity, and the integrity of U.S. institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
