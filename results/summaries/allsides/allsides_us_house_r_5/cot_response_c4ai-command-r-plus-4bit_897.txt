SUMMARY:
Republicans are calling for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing him of "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic" behavior in his investigation into President Trump's alleged collusion with Russia. They argue that Schiff has "abused his power" and "misrepresented information" by continuing to promote a "demonstrably false narrative" of collusion even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy. In response, Schiff defended his actions, citing instances of inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and Russians, and stating that he finds their interactions "corrupt." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has supported Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism as unfounded. Republicans have instead shifted the blame to the Clinton campaign, accusing them of colluding with Russians to spread disinformation about Trump. They argue that Schiff's continued investigation, along with his hiring of prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts, undermines faith in U.S. government institutions and exposes him as promoting false information. Rep. Michael Turner even likened Schiff to Senator Joseph McCarthy, known for his anti-communist witch hunts in the 1950s. This confrontation underscores the deep partisan divide surrounding the Russia investigation and raises questions about the integrity of those involved.
