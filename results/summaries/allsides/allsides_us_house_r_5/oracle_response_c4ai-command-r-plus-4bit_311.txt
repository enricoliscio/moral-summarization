SUMMARY: Republicans confronted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, urging him to resign due to his conspiracy charges against President Trump. They cited Mueller's findings that refuted claims of collusion between Trump associates and Russia. Schiff defended himself by listing inappropriate contacts between Trump Jr., Manafort, and Stone with Russians, but did not provide evidence of coordination. In a letter, Republicans accused Schiff of promoting false narratives, abusing his power, and undermining faith in U.S. institutions. They compared his actions to McCarthyism, stating that he is adding prosecutors instead of intelligence analysts to his staff. Schiff reacted angrily, tweeting that he finds the interactions between Trump associates and Russians immoral, unethical, and unpatriotic. Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, dismissing Republican criticism. Republicans countered by alleging collusion by the Clinton campaign with the Kremlin. The dispute highlights the ethical dilemmas and conflicting oversight duties in the Intelligence Committee.
END OF SUMMARY.
