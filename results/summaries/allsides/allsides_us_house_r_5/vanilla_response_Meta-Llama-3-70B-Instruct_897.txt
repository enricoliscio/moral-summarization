SUMMARY:

House Republicans have called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, citing a lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties. The Republicans, led by Rep. Devin Nunes, claim that Schiff has abused his power by promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. They point to the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who found no evidence of conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia. Schiff has defended himself, listing instances of Trump associates' contacts with foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of coordination with Russia. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have rallied behind Schiff, with Pelosi calling the Republican criticism "scaredy-cats." The dispute highlights the ongoing partisan divide over the Russia investigation.
