SUMMARY:
House Republicans have called for Rep. Adam Schiff to resign as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing his "inability to discharge his duties" due to his past claims of conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia. Schiff defended himself, listing contacts between Trump associates and foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of Russian election interference. Republicans argue that Schiff's actions are "incompatible" with his duty and that he has "abused" his position to promote "false" information. Schiff countered, calling Trump's interactions with Russians "immoral", "unethical", and "unpatriotic". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Schiff, calling Republicans "scaredy-cats". The dispute highlights the ongoing partisan divide over the Russia probe. END OF SUMMARY.
