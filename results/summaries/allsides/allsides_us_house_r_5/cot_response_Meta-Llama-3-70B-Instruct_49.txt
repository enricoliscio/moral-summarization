SUMMARY:
House Republicans confronted Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, urging him to resign due to his two years of leveling conspiracy charges against President Trump. Schiff defended himself by listing supposed inappropriate contacts between Trump associates and suspect foreigners, but failed to provide evidence of Trump campaign coordination with Russia in the 2016 election. Republicans accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false narrative" and "knowingly" spreading misinformation, which they deemed "alarming" and "corrupt." Schiff countered that Trump's interactions with Russians during the campaign were "immoral," "unethical," and "unpatriotic." The Republican letter stated that Schiff's actions were "incompatible" with his duties as Chairman, and that he had "damaged" the integrity of the Committee and "undermined" faith in U.S. government institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
