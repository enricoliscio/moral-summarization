Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Republicans confronting Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, for his handling of the Russia probe. They're urging him to resign because they don't trust his ability to do his job properly. Schiff is a Democrat, and he's been leading investigations into whether Trump's associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. 

The Republicans, led by Devin Nunes, sent a letter to Schiff saying his actions are incompatible with his duties. They reference Robert Mueller's findings, which didn't find any collusion between Trump's team and Russia. Schiff, on the other hand, is continuing his investigation, which the Republicans see as promoting a false narrative. They compare him to Joseph McCarthy, implying he's using fear tactics to push an agenda.

Schiff defends his work, listing instances like Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and Manafort's interactions, but Mueller didn't find any evidence of collusion. Schiff is also adding prosecutors to his team, which the Republicans see as biased. They believe he's using the committee to promote a narrative that's been proven false by Mueller.

I need to make sure I include the morally charged words the author used: discharge, interference, actions, incompatible, oversight, okay, interacted, immoral, unethical, unpatriotic, corrupt, continue, proclaim, collusion, investigate, promote, narrative, assertions, abused, damaged, undermined, misrepresented, chasing, adding, hurls.

So, the summary should highlight the conflict between Schiff and the Republicans, their accusations against him, his defense, and the moral terms used by both sides. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is preserved.

Let me structure it: start with Republicans urging Schiff to resign because they don't have faith in his oversight. Mention Mueller's findings and Schiff's continued investigation. Include the accusations of promoting a false narrative and compare him to McCarthy. Also, note Schiff's response and Pelosi's support. Make sure to use the moral words like incompatible, unethical, corrupt, etc.

I think that covers the main points while preserving the moral language. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Republicans demanded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's resignation, citing his "incompatible" actions and lack of faith in his ability to discharge his duties. They accused him of promoting a "false narrative" about Russian interference, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings of no collusion between Trump associates and Russia. Schiff defended his oversight, listing instances like Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer and Manafort's interactions, but Mueller found no evidence of collusion. Republicans criticized Schiff for continuing to investigate, claiming his actions were "unethical" and "corrupt." They likened him to McCarthy, accusing him of "chasing" false allegations. Schiff, however, labeled Trump's associates' interactions with Russians as "immoral" and "unpatriotic." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supported Schiff, while Republicans argued his actions damaged the committee's integrity. Schiff added prosecutors to his team, including Daniel Goldman, who endorsed the Steele dossier, which Mueller rejected. END OF SUMMARY.
