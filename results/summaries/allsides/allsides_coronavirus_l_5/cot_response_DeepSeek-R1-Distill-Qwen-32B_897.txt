Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the morally framed single words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" means. It refers to words that carry a moral judgment or implication, like "reckless," "lying," or "corrupt." These words convey a value judgment rather than just stating facts.

Looking at the article, I should go through each sentence and pick out words that have such connotations. For example, "dubious," "reckless," "lying," "corrupt," "discredited," "demean," "deny," "boycott," "menace," "tolerate," "support," "advocate," "blame," and "harm." Each of these words carries a negative moral judgment against Trump or his supporters.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and capture the essence of the article's criticism towards Trump's actions and the implications for public health and safety.

I should structure the summary to highlight the four main points the article makes: the untrustworthiness of Trump's claims, the corruption of those around him, the discredit of his leadership, and the call for accountability on platforms. Each point should incorporate the identified moral terms to maintain the original framing.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point and showing the overall impact of Trump's actions. It's important to mention the Republican supporters' role in perpetuating the issue, emphasizing collective blame.

Finally, I'll make sure to format the response correctly, starting with the step of listing the moral words, followed by the summary, all within the specified tokens. Keeping the language clear and direct will help convey the message effectively.
