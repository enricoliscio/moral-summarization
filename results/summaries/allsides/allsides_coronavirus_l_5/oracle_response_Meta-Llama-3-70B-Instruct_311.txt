SUMMARY:

Trump's claim to be taking hydroxychloroquine, a potentially dangerous treatment, is dubious and raises concerns about his reckless behavior. His press secretary's backing of this claim is meaningless, given her history of lying to support her boss. This episode highlights four key points: Trump's words cannot be taken at face value, as he will lie about anything; he corrupts those around him, inducing them to violate professional responsibilities or ignore warnings; he is willing to put the country at risk to "own the libs" and make himself look smarter; and he shows a total absence of empathy, ignoring the nearly 90,000 Americans lost to the pandemic. Republicans who support Trump's reelection are equally to blame for the harm that ensues. They are tolerating, supporting, and advocating for a menace to public health and safety. By backing Trump, they are risking lives and ignoring the warnings of experts. It is imperative to hold them accountable for their conduct.

END OF SUMMARY.
