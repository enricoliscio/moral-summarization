SUMMARY:
Trump's claim to take a potentially dangerous drug, hydroxychloroquine, is dubious and reckless, and his press secretary's confirmation of it is unreliable. This episode highlights that nothing Trump says can be taken at face value, and he corrupts everyone around him, inducing them to violate professional responsibilities or ignore FDA warnings. His actions are discredited, and he is willing to put his own life and others' at risk to "own the libs" by demeaning experts and denying science. His absence of empathy is evident in his lack of response to the nearly 90,000 American lives lost. Trump's behavior is a menace to public health and safety, and every Republican who supports his reelection is equally to blame for the harm that ensues. END OF SUMMARY.
