SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's claim that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against COVID-19, despite the White House physician's letter only stating that they discussed the topic and concluded the benefits outweigh the risks. The author argues that Trump's claim is dubious and that he would lie about anything, including putting his own life at risk. The article also highlights how Trump corrupts those around him, including the White House physician, and that his actions have discredited the notion that he would never put the country at risk. Furthermore, the author notes that Trump's behavior is reckless and dangerous, and that if anyone else were to induce the public to engage in such activity, they would be booted off social media platforms. The article concludes that not only Trump, but also the entire Republican party that supports him, is a menace to public health and safety.
