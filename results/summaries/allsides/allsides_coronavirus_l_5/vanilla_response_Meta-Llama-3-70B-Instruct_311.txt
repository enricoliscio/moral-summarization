SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's claim that he is taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug unproven to treat COVID-19, despite warnings from the FDA. The White House physician's letter does not confirm Trump's claim, and the press secretary's statement is unreliable. This incident highlights four points: Trump's words cannot be taken at face value, he corrupts those around him, he is willing to risk the country's well-being for personal gain, and he should be held accountable for promoting dangerous behavior. The article argues that Republicans who support Trump's reelection are equally to blame for the harm that ensues. The author notes that even Fox News commentators have criticized Trump's conduct, and that Trump's actions demonstrate a lack of empathy and a willingness to put his own supporters' lives at risk.
