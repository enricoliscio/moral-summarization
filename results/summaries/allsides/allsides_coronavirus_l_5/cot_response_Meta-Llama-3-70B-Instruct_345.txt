SUMMARY:
Trump's claim to take a potentially dangerous drug, hydroxychloroquine, is dubious and reckless, and his press secretary's confirmation of it is untrustworthy. The White House physician's letter backing up Trump's claim is suspect, and raises questions about whether Trump is corrupting those around him, including the doctor. Trump's behavior is discredited, and his lying about taking the drug is a menace to public health and safety. He has no empathy and is only concerned with projecting normalcy to preserve his chances of reelection. His actions are a reflection of his total absence of empathy. Republicans who tolerate and support his reelection are equally to blame for the harm that ensues. Trump's behavior is a danger to the country, and his party's backing of him is a threat to public health and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
