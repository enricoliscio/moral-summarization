Okay, I need to summarize this article about Trump and his claims regarding taking a drug. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Trump's claim that the White House physician prescribed him a drug. However, the physician's letter only states that they discussed the benefits outweighing the risks, without specifying what those benefits are. Trump's press secretary also claims he's taking the drug, but she's known for supporting Trump's statements regardless of their truthfulness.

The article then discusses four key points. The first is that Trump's statements about himself and his actions can't be taken at face value. Mainstream media no longer assumes he's truthful, and if he lies about medical treatments, he'll lie about other things too, like test results.

The second point is about Trump corrupting those around him. The physician's letter seems to violate professional responsibilities, and no one in his administration stands up against him, suggesting that regulatory bodies need to reevaluate their oversight.

Third, the article argues that Trump's actions have discredited the idea that he wouldn't put the country at risk. He often belittles experts and denies science to appear smarter, showing little concern for the consequences, like the high death toll from the pandemic without any mourning gestures.

Lastly, the article suggests that anyone promoting dangerous activities, like Trump, should be removed from platforms, even though some conservative commentators have criticized him. Despite this, Republicans support him, making them equally responsible for the harm caused.

I need to condense all these points into a concise summary under 200 words, ensuring all four main arguments are covered clearly.

The piece highlights four key points: Trump's statements are unreliable, he influences others to compromise their ethics, he disregards expert advice and public safety, and his supporters share responsibility for the harm caused. The article concludes that Trump's behavior, including lying about medical treatments, reflects a broader pattern of dishonesty and disregard for public health. END OF SUMMARY.
