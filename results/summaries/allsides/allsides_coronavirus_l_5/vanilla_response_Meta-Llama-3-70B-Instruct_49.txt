SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's claim that he is taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug unproven to treat COVID-19, despite warnings from the FDA. The White House physician's letter does not confirm Trump's claim, and the press secretary's statement is unreliable. The article argues that Trump's actions demonstrate his disregard for truth and public safety. He corrupts those around him, including the White House physician, and has no qualms about lying or putting lives at risk. The article also criticizes Republicans for tolerating and supporting Trump's behavior, which poses a threat to public health and safety. It concludes that Trump's actions are reckless and that those who back him are equally responsible for the harm that ensues.

END OF SUMMARY.
