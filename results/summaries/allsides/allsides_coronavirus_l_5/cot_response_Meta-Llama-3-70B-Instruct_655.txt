SUMMARY:
Trump's claim to be taking hydroxychloroquine, despite the dubious benefits, is a reckless move that puts his own life at risk and sets a dangerous example for others to follow. His press secretary's support for this claim is unconvincing, given her propensity to lie for her boss. This episode highlights Trump's corrupting influence on those around him, including the White House physician, who has either violated professional responsibilities or written a misleading letter. Trump's behavior is discredited, and his absence of empathy is evident in his refusal to acknowledge the nearly 90,000 American lives lost to the pandemic. His actions are a menace to public health and safety, and every Republican who supports his reelection is equally to blame for the harm that ensues. END OF SUMMARY.
