SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's claim that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against COVID-19, despite the FDA's warnings against its use for this purpose. The White House physician's letter supporting Trump's claim is ambiguous, and the press secretary's confirmation is unreliable. The article argues that Trump's actions are reckless and put others' lives at risk, and that his behavior has four instructive aspects. Firstly, nothing Trump says can be taken at face value. Secondly, he corrupts those around him, including medical professionals and lawyers. Thirdly, he has shown a willingness to put the country at risk for personal gain. Finally, his promotion of dangerous behavior should be condemned, and his supporters in the Republican party are equally to blame for the harm that ensues.
