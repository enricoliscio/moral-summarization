Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article talks about Trump taking hydroxychloroquine, with the White House physician's letter not fully backing his claim. It's critical of Trump's credibility, his administration's complicity, and the broader implications for public health and safety.

I should start by highlighting Trump's claim and the lack of credible backing. Then mention the press secretary's support, which isn't reliable. The article questions whether Trump is actually taking the drug or lying, which puts others at risk.

Next, the article points out that Trump's lies aren't just about this drug but extend to other areas, showing he can't be trusted. It also discusses how Trump's actions corrupt those around him, like the physician, and how his administration doesn't hold him accountable.

The summary should also touch on the broader implications: Trump's tendency to ignore expert advice, his lack of empathy, and the support from his party despite the harm. I need to use words like "concluded," "lying," "risking," "corrupts," "induced," "ignore," "warnings," "die," "declare," "mourning," "lost," "preserve," "induce," "booted," "deplored," "backs," "tolerates," "supports," "advocates," "harm."

I should structure the summary to cover these points concisely, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate. I'll aim for a clear flow, starting with Trump's claim, moving to the administration's complicity, then the broader implications, and ending with the call for accountability.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The article critically examines President Trump's claim of taking hydroxychloroquine, noting the White House physician's letter only stated the drug's benefits outweigh risks, without clear evidence. Trump's press secretary supports his claim, but her credibility is questioned. The debate highlights Trump's tendency to lie, risking his own life and others', and reflects his broader pattern of deception, such as falsely claiming U.S. COVID-19 testing leads the world. Trump's actions corrupt those around him, inducing professionals to violate responsibilities, and his administration fails to hold him accountable. The article warns Trump's reckless behavior, like demeaning experts and denying science, endangers public health and safety. His lack of empathy, shown by not mourning COVID-19 deaths, further discredits his leadership. The piece calls for platforms to remove those inducing dangerous behavior, as even allies like Fox News commentators deplored his conduct. Republicans' support for Trump's reelection, despite the harm caused, shares blame for the ongoing crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
