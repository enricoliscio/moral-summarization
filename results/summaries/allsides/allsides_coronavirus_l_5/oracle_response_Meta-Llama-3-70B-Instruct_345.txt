SUMMARY:

Trump's claim to be taking hydroxychloroquine despite its potential dangers has sparked a debate about whether he is recklessly risking his own life or lying about it, thereby putting others' lives at risk. The author argues that Trump's actions are morally reprehensible, as he corrupts those around him, induces a doctor to violate professional responsibilities, and ignores FDA warnings. His willingness to lie about taking a potentially dangerous treatment suggests he will lie about anything, including the number of COVID-19 tests conducted in the US. The author also criticizes Republicans for tolerating and supporting Trump's harmful behavior, which has led to the loss of nearly 90,000 American lives. Trump's conduct is deemed so egregious that even Fox News commentators have deplored it. The author concludes that Trump's actions are a menace to public health and safety, and that every Republican who backs him is equally to blame for the harm that ensues.

END OF SUMMARY.
