Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the tone.

The article talks about Trump claiming he took hydroxychloroquine based on a White House physician's advice. The physician's letter only mentions discussing the benefits and risks, not prescribing it. Trump's press secretary supports this claim, but she's known for promoting her boss's statements regardless of their truthfulness.

The author discusses four points. First, Trump's credibility is low because he lies frequently, even about serious issues like pandemic testing. Second, Trump influences those around him to bend professional ethics, like the doctor. Third, Trump's pattern of ignoring expert advice and putting the country at risk, as seen in his pandemic handling and other reckless actions. Fourth, platforms should remove anyone promoting dangerous behavior, even Fox News commentators criticized him. Lastly, Republicans supporting Trump are also responsible for the harm caused.

I need to capture these points concisely, keeping the critical tone. The summary should highlight Trump's dishonesty, the corruption of his associates, the risks he poses, and the complicity of his supporters. I'll make sure to stay under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.
