SUMMARY:

The article discusses President Trump's claim that he is taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug unproven to treat COVID-19, despite warnings from the FDA. The White House physician's letter does not confirm Trump's claim, and the press secretary's statement is unreliable. This incident highlights four key points: Trump's words cannot be taken at face value, he corrupts those around him, he is willing to risk the country's safety for personal gain, and he has no empathy for those affected by the pandemic. The article argues that Trump's actions are reckless and dangerous, and that Republicans who support him are equally to blame for the harm that ensues. It also suggests that social media platforms should boot Trump off for promoting dangerous activity, and that his supporters should be held accountable for enabling his harmful behavior.
