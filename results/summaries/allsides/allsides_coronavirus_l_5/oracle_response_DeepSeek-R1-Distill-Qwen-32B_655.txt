Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I should make sure to use as many of these words as possible without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump claiming he took hydroxychloroquine, with the White House physician's letter only stating that benefits outweigh risks, not a prescription. Trump's press secretary supports this claim, but the author questions her credibility. The debate is about whether Trump is reckless or lying, which raises four points: Trump's unreliability, corruption of his associates, his tendency to put the country at risk, and the need for platforms to remove those inducing danger.

Now, I'll identify key morally framed words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like "claimed," "prescribed," "concluded," "lying," "risking," "corrupts," "induced," "violate," "ignore," "warnings," "assumption," "ignoring," "war," "weaken," "demean," "deny," "die," "fly," "declare," "pray," "mourning," "lost," "project," "preserve," "induce," "booted," "deplore," "conduct," "backs," "remain," "tolerate," "support," "advocate," "harm."

I'll structure the summary to cover each point, using these words. Start with Trump's claim and the physician's letter, then mention the press secretary's support. Highlight the debate's four points: Trump's unreliability, corruption of associates, risking the country, and the need for accountability. Conclude with the impact on public health and the responsibility of Republicans.

I need to keep each sentence concise, ensuring the summary flows logically and includes the moral framing without exceeding 200 words. I'll also make sure to use the specified token markers correctly.

SUMMARY: The article critiques President Trump's claim of taking hydroxychloroquine, noting the White House physician's letter only concluded benefits outweigh risks, not prescribing it. Trump's press secretary supports his claim, but her credibility is questioned. The debate over whether Trump is recklessly risking his life or lying highlights four moral issues: Trump's unreliability, his corrupting influence on associates, his tendency to risk national safety, and the need for platforms to remove those inducing danger. The author argues Trump's actions, like demeaning experts and denying science, show he prioritizes his reelection over public health, with no empathy for the 90,000 lost. Republicans tolerating and supporting Trump are equally responsible for the harm caused. END OF SUMMARY.
