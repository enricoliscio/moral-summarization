SUMMARY:
Trump's claim to be taking a potentially dangerous drug, hydroxychloroquine, is dubious and reckless, and his press secretary's confirmation of it is meaningless. This episode highlights four key points. Firstly, nothing Trump says can be taken at face value, and his propensity for lying is well-established. Secondly, Trump corrupts everyone around him, inducing them to violate their professional responsibilities. Thirdly, Trump has no qualms about putting the country at risk, even if it means some of his own supporters die. Finally, Trump's dangerous behavior should be condemned, and any other person engaging in such behavior would be booted off social media platforms. The fact that Republicans continue to support him is a menace to public health and safety, and they are equally to blame for the harm that ensues. END OF SUMMARY.
