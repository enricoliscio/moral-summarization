SUMMARY:

The article highlights the moral implications of Trump's claim to be taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug not approved for COVID-19 treatment. The author argues that Trump's reckless behavior sets a dangerous example for others, and that his willingness to lie about it puts lives at risk. The incident also exposes the corrupting influence Trump has on those around him, including the White House physician, who wrote a letter supporting Trump's claim without verifying its truth. The author notes that Trump's actions demonstrate a lack of empathy and a willingness to prioritize his own interests over public health and safety. The article concludes that Trump's behavior is a menace to public health and that every Republican who supports his reelection is equally to blame for the harm that ensues.

END OF SUMMARY.
