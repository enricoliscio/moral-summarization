SUMMARY: Trump claims he is taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19, but his press secretary's claims cannot be verified and his doctor's letter of support is dubious. This incident is instructive in four ways. First, Trump's words cannot be taken at face value and the media no longer affords him the presumption of truthfulness given to other presidents. Second, Trump corrupts those around him, inducing them to violate professional responsibilities or ignore warnings. Third, Trump is willing to put the country at risk by ignoring the pandemic, risking war, and weakening alliances. He prioritizes owning the libs and making himself look smart, even if it means his supporters die. Finally, Trump and those who induce dangerous behavior should be removed from public platforms, yet Republicans continue to support him and advocate for his reelection, sharing the blame for the harm caused. Trump's actions and those of his enablers pose a serious threat to public health and safety.
END OF SUMMARY.
