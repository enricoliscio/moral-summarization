Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specific instructions. Let me break it down.

First, the user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words. They mentioned "STEP 1:" and each word should be listed with an asterisk. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral judgment, like "reckless," "dishonest," "corrupt," etc.

Next, I have to write a summary. It needs to be under 200 words and include as many of those moral words as possible. The summary should reflect the author's perspective, which is critical of Trump and his administration.

I should start by reading the article carefully. It talks about Trump taking a drug, the physician's letter, the press secretary's claims, and the implications of his actions. The author is clearly disapproving, highlighting lies, recklessness, corruption, and the impact on public health.

In the summary, I need to mention Trump's claims, the physician's vague support, the press secretary's credibility issues, the risks involved, and the broader implications like corruption and lack of empathy. I should also touch on the Republican support and the need for platform accountability.

I'll make sure to include the key moral terms identified in STEP 1. Let me list those first to ensure they're all covered in the summary. Words like "reckless," "dishonest," "corrupt," "endanger," "depravity," etc., should be included where appropriate.

Now, putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with Trump's claims, moving to the implications, and ending with the consequences of his actions and the support he receives. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to draft the summary, making sure it's tight and includes all the necessary moral framing elements.

**STEP 1:**  
* Reckless  
* Dubious  
* Propensity

* Deny  
* Lie  
* Risk  
* Empathy

**SUMMARY:**  
The article critiques President Trump's claim of taking a potentially dangerous drug, highlighting the moral and ethical issues surrounding his actions. Trump's press secretary and physician have been accused of supporting his dubious claims, with the latter's letter being vague and lacking concrete evidence. The article argues that Trump's reckless behavior, whether real or fabricated, endangers public health and demonstrates a pattern of dishonesty and corruption. It questions the integrity of his administration, as officials appear unwilling to challenge his decisions, even when they violate professional or ethical standards. The piece also condemns Trump's lack of empathy, as he has not mourned the nearly 90,000 American deaths from the pandemic, instead prioritizing normalcy for political gain. The article further criticizes Republicans for enabling Trump's harmful actions and calls for accountability for those who propagate such behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
