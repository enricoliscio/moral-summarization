SUMMARY: Despite the White House physician's claim that he prescribed hydroxychloroquine to Trump, the president's assertion is dubious as the physician's letter only stated they discussed the topic. Trump's press secretary's claim that he is taking the drug doesn't prove anything as she has a history of saying whatever her boss requires. This debate is instructive in four ways. First, nothing Trump says about himself or his actions can be taken at face value. Second, Trump corrupts everyone around him, inducing them to violate professional responsibilities or ignore warnings. Third, Trump's willingness to put the country at risk by ignoring the pandemic, risking war, or weakening allies has been discredited. Finally, Trump and those who induce the public to engage in dangerous activity, such as Republicans who support his reelection, are a menace to public health and safety and should be held accountable. Trump's disregard for the lives of his supporters and his failure to acknowledge the nearly 90,000 American lives lost reflect his lack of empathy and insistence on projecting normalcy for reelection.
END OF SUMMARY.
