SUMMARY: 
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing their recent missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels as justification. The sanctions target 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, blocking their property and funds under U.S. jurisdiction. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, emphasized that Iran's ballistic missile program and continued support for terrorism pose a threat to the region, allies, and the United States. 

The administration's actions send a clear message that they will no longer tolerate Iran's provocative behavior, including their support for terrorism and ballistic missile development. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn condemned Iran as the "world's leading state sponsor of terrorism" and asserted that the previous administration had been too tolerant of Iran's transgressions. 

Iran has denied that their missile tests violate UN regulations and has mocked President Trump's criticism. Ali Akbar Velayati, senior adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, dismissed Trump's threats, claiming that "empty and baseless ranting should be stopped." 

These sanctions, which have been in the works for months, focus on Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups rather than the Iranian nuclear deal. The Trump administration has signaled a tougher stance towards Iran, aiming to hold them accountable for their *provocative* actions and *threatening* behavior.
