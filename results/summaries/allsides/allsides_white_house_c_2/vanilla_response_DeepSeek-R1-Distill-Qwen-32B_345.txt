Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the Trump administration is imposing new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies. The reasons given are Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen, specifically the Houthis. John E. Smith from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control is quoted, stating that Iran's support for terrorism and ballistic missile program is a threat. Trump himself commented that Iran "isn't behaving."

The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction. They also prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. Trump tweeted about Iran playing with fire, comparing Obama's approach to his own. The administration cited the missile test and support for the Houthis as reasons.

The article also notes that these sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which the U.S. and allies had with Iran. While Trump criticized the deal during his campaign, he hasn't voided it yet. The sanctions focus on missile activities and terrorism, not nuclear issues. Iran denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism. The Treasury Department is led by Adam Szubin, a holdover from the Obama administration, and Steve Mnuchin is awaiting Senate confirmation.

Lawmakers supported the sanctions but wanted clarity on the administration's strategy towards Iran. National security adviser Michael Flynn called Iran the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.

So, the main points are: new sanctions on Iran for missile tests and supporting rebels, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing assets, prohibiting transactions, separate from nuclear deal, Iran denies violations, Trump's comments and tweets, administration's focus on missile and terrorism issues, and lawmakers' mixed reactions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all key elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by stating the sanctions, reasons, who's affected, the administration's stance, Iran's response, and the context of the nuclear deal and lawmakers' reactions.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's concise and within the limit.
