SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions are a response to Iran's "continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program," which poses a "threat" to the region, partners worldwide, and the United States. The Treasury Department will "actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address this behavior." The sanctions affect 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. Trump signaled the sanctions, warning that Iran is "playing with fire" and that his administration will not tolerate its "bad behavior." The sanctions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement, but rather target Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups. Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions, but urged the administration to clarify its strategy towards Iran and refrain from "ambiguous rhetoric" that could exacerbate tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
