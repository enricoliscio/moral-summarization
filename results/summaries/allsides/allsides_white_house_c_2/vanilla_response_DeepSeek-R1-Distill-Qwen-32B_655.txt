Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. The article is about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully. The key points seem to be that the US is imposing sanctions because of Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. They mention the Acting Director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, John E. Smith, and his statements about the threat Iran poses. 

I should note that Trump himself commented on Iran, saying they're not behaving. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets. It's important to mention that these sanctions don't affect the nuclear deal, which Trump criticized during the campaign but hasn't voided yet. 

Also, the article mentions that the sanctions are part of ongoing efforts from the Obama administration and that the Acting Secretary is from the previous administration. The response from Iran is to deny any violations and mock Trump's criticism. 

The user wants the summary to be concise, no more than 200 words, and to include all the main points without getting too detailed. I need to make sure I cover the reasons for the sanctions, who is affected, the administration's stance, and Iran's response. 

I should structure the summary to start with the announcement of the sanctions, then the reasons, who is targeted, and the reactions from both the US and Iran. Also, it's important to mention that these sanctions don't impact the nuclear deal but are related to missile programs and terrorism support.

I need to keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any jargon. Make sure each sentence is concise and covers a single point. I'll also need to end with the specified tokens, "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me piece this together, ensuring each key point is included without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count after drafting to make sure it's under 200 words. 

I think that's all. Time to put it together.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorist groups like the Houthis in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to regional and global stability. The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with the sanctioned entities. Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that they "are playing with fire." Iran denies violating UN regulations and mocks Trump's criticism, with senior adviser Ali Akbar Velayati dismissing the threats. The sanctions do not affect the nuclear deal, which Trump previously criticized but has not voided. The administration emphasized its commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's missile program and destabilizing activities. Lawmakers supported the move but urged clarity on the administration's strategy toward Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
