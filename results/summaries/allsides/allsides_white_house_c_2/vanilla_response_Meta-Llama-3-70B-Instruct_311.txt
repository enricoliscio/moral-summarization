SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The Treasury Department stated that the action reflects the US' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. The sanctions are separate from the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but shown no signs of voiding. Trump signaled the sanctions with a tweet, saying "Iran is playing with fire" and that he will not be as "kind" as President Obama was to them. Iranian officials have denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism. Lawmakers have generally applauded the sanctions, but questioned the administration's sabre-rattling toward Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
