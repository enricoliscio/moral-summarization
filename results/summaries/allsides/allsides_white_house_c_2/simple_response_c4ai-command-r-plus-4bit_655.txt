SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as evidence of their immoral behavior and threat to global security. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, emphasized that Iran's support for terrorism and ballistic missile development poses a danger to the world. The sanctions freeze any property or funds under U.S. jurisdiction held by the targeted individuals and companies, sending a strong message against Iran's destabilizing actions. 

Trump highlighted the sanctions on Twitter, contrasting his tough stance with the previous administration's approach. The measures were taken in response to Iran's ballistic missile test and support for the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, demonstrating the administration's commitment to holding Iran accountable for its threatening behavior. Iranian officials responded with defiance and ridicule, dismissing the sanctions as ineffective and claiming that threatening Iran will not work. 

The sanctions specifically target Iran's missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups, while the nuclear agreement remains untouched. Officials emphasized that the measures are a result of an ongoing review of Iranian activity and reflect a commitment to enforcing sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program and regional destabilization. 

END OF SUMMARY.
