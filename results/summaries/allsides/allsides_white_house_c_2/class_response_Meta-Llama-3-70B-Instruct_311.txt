SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as a threat to the region and the United States. The sanctions, which affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, freeze any property or funds they may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. The Treasury Department stated that the action reflects the United States' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. Trump signaled the sanctions, saying "Iran is playing with fire" and that "they don't appreciate how 'kind' President Obama was to them." Iran has denied violating United Nations regulations and mocked Trump's criticism, calling it "empty and baseless ranting." The administration has pledged to keep a close eye on Iran's behavior, calling it "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." END OF SUMMARY.
