SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under US jurisdiction. The move is seen as a warning to Iran, with Trump saying "they're not behaving" and signaling that the US will no longer tolerate Iran's "bad behavior". The Treasury Department emphasized that the sanctions are aimed at Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region, and are separate from the nuclear deal. Iranian officials have dismissed the sanctions, with a senior adviser to the supreme leader saying that "threatening Iran will not work". The US has pledged to keep a close eye on the Iranian regime, with national security adviser Michael Flynn calling Iran "the worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism".
