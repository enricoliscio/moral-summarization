SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as evidence of Iran's threatening behavior. The sanctions freeze any property or funds under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with those on the sanctions list. The Treasury Department stated that these sanctions address Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn further emphasized that the Trump administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations and threats to U.S. interests. These sanctions have been in the works for months and are outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal. They specifically target individuals and companies linked to Iran's missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups. While Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked the president's criticism, the U.S. government is committed to enforcing sanctions and addressing Iran's threatening behavior. 

END OF SUMMARY.
