SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing their recent missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their property and funds under U.S. jurisdiction. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, stated that Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorism pose a threat to the U.S. and its partners. These sanctions are a response to Iran's "bad behavior," as described by National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who also asserted that the international community has been too *tolerant of Iran's provocations. While the Iranian nuclear deal was not directly mentioned in the sanctions, the Treasury Department emphasized that these measures address Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate UN regulations and has mocked President Trump's criticism. The Trump administration's actions reflect a tougher stance on Iran, signaling a departure from the previous administration's approach. These sanctions aim to hold Iran accountable for its threatening actions and support for terrorist groups. END OF SUMMARY.
