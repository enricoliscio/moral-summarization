SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The administration claims that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region, global partners, and the US. Trump has signaled a tougher stance on Iran, tweeting that they are "playing with fire" and that his administration will not tolerate their "bad behavior." The sanctions are separate from the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but has shown no signs of voiding. Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions, but some have expressed concern over the administration's rhetoric, urging clarity and restraint in their approach to Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
