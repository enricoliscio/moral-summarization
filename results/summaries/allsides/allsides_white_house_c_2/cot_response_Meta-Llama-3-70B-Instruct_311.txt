SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's "bad behavior" in recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions, which freeze any property or funds under U.S. jurisdiction, affect 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies. The administration claims that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region, partners worldwide, and the United States. Trump signaled the sanctions with a tweet, warning Iran that it is "playing with fire" and that he will not be as "kind" as President Obama was. Iranian officials have denied any wrongdoing and mocked Trump's criticism, calling him "inexperienced" and accusing him of "empty and baseless ranting." The sanctions are seen as a warning to Iran, with the administration pledging to keep a close eye on the regime's "provocations." Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions, but some have cautioned against "ambiguous" rhetoric that could exacerbate tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
