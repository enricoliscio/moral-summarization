SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as justification. The sanctions freeze any property or funds under U.S. jurisdiction held by the targeted entities and individuals, and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region and the U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn called Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." The sanctions were imposed outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal, targeting Iran's missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate UN regulations and has mocked President Trump's criticism. The Treasury Department stated that the sanctions reflect the U.S. commitment to enforcing sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region.
END OF SUMMARY.
