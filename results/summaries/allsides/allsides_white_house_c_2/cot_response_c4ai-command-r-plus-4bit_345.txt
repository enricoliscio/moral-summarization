SUMMARY: 
The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing their recent missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels. The sanctions freeze any property or funds these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, stated that Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorism pose a threat to the U.S. and its partners. The administration's actions were framed as a response to Iran's "bad behavior" and "provocations," including their alleged support for terrorist groups. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn called Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." Lawmakers generally applauded the sanctions but urged the administration to clarify its overall strategy towards Iran and refrain from ambiguous rhetoric or provocative tweets that could exacerbate tensions. These sanctions build on existing restrictions outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal, targeting Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups. The Trump administration has signaled a tougher stance on Iran, accusing them of "playing with fire." Iran has denied that its missile tests violate U.N. regulations and has mocked the president's criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
