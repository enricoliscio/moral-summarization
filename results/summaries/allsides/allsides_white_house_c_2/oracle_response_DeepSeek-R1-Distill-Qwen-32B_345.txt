Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Trump administration is imposing new sanctions on Iran because of missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction. The article mentions the nuclear deal but notes that these new sanctions are separate. Iran denies violating UN regulations and mocks Trump's criticism. The summary should include the morally charged words provided, like "support," "terrorism," "threat," "sanctions," etc. I need to make sure these words are included to maintain the author's framing. I'll structure the summary to highlight the reasons for the sanctions, the specifics of who's affected, Iran's response, and the context of the nuclear deal. Keeping it concise, around 200 words, and ending with the required tokens. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to the facts presented, ensuring the moral terms are preserved.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, citing its "continued support for terrorism" and the "development" of its ballistic missile program, which pose a "threat" to the region and the U.S. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibiting transactions with them. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith emphasized the administration's "commitment" to "address" Iran's "destabilizing activities," including its missile program and support for groups like the Houthis in Yemen. Trump described Iran as "playing with fire" and criticized its behavior, while Iran denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism. The sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump has questioned but not voided. Officials stressed that the U.S. will no longer "tolerate" Iran's "provocations" and "bad behavior." Lawmakers supported the sanctions but called for clarity in the administration's strategy toward Iran, urging it to avoid "exacerbating" tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
