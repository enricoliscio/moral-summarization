SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under US jurisdiction. The administration claims that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region, global partners, and the US. Trump has taken a tough stance, tweeting that Iran is "playing with fire" and that his administration will not tolerate its "bad behavior." The sanctions are seen as a warning to Iran, with the administration pledging to continue applying financial pressure to address its "destabilizing activities." The move has been applauded by lawmakers, but some have expressed concerns over the administration's rhetoric, urging clarity and restraint in its approach towards Iran. The sanctions are separate from the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but has shown no signs of voiding.

END OF SUMMARY.
