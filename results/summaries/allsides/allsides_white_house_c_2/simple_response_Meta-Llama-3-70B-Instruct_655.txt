SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The administration claims that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region, global partners, and the US. Trump tweeted that Iran is "playing with fire" and doesn't appreciate the kindness of former President Obama. Iranian officials have denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism. The sanctions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement and aim to address Iran's missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups. The administration has pledged to keep a close eye on Iran, with national security adviser Michael Flynn calling it "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions but urged the administration to clarify its overall strategy towards Iran.
