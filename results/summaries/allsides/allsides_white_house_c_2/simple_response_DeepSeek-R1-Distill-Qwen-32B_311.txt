Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran, citing missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The moral framing here is about Iran's threat to regional stability and support for terrorism. The sanctions target individuals and companies linked to missile programs and terrorist activities, not the nuclear deal. The administration's actions are presented as necessary to counter Iran's destabilizing behavior.

I should make sure the summary includes key points: the reason for sanctions (missile tests, Yemen support), the number of individuals and companies affected, the scope of the sanctions (not related to the nuclear deal), and the administration's commitment to enforcing them. Also, include Iran's denial and the context of the nuclear agreement. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral stance presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and support for rebels in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to regional stability and the U.S., emphasizing the administration's commitment to countering such behavior. The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with those targeted, while explicitly excluding the nuclear deal. Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that it "is playing with fire," and his administration highlighted Iran's recent missile test and support for the Houthis as justifications. Iran denied violating UN regulations and dismissed Trump's criticism, asserting that threats would not deter it. The sanctions, which focus on non-nuclear activities, were developed during the Obama administration and are part of ongoing efforts to address Iran's destabilizing actions. END OF SUMMARY.
