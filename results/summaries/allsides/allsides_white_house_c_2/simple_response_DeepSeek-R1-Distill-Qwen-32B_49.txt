Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the sanctions are due to Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The acting director of OFAC, John Smith, states that Iran's support for terrorism and missile program is a threat. Trump tweets about Iran not appreciating Obama's kindness, implying a tougher stance. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting transactions. These are separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump criticized but hasn't revoked.

Iran denies violating UN regulations and mocks Trump's criticism. The sanctions focus on missile activity and alleged terrorist support, not the nuclear deal. The Treasury Department's acting secretary is from the Obama administration, and Steve Mnuchin is awaiting confirmation. Spicer mentions the sanctions were triggered by missile tests and terrorist activities. Flynn calls Iran the leading state sponsor of terrorism, and lawmakers support the sanctions but want a clear strategy.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing. The moral aspect here is the US's stance against Iran's threat to regional and global security, support for terrorism, and defiance of international norms. I should highlight the reasons for sanctions, their scope, and reactions from both sides, emphasizing the moral justification against Iran's actions.

I'll structure the summary by stating the imposition of sanctions, the reasons (missile tests, Yemen rebels), the threat to security, the scope of sanctions, and reactions. I'll ensure it's concise and within the word limit.
