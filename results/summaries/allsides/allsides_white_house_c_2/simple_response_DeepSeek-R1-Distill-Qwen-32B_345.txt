Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The key points are the reasons for the sanctions, the targets, and the reactions from both the U.S. and Iran.

First, I should note that the sanctions are due to Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen, as well as their nuclear activities. The author's moral framing seems to be that Iran is a threat and that the U.S. is taking necessary action against them.

I need to include who is imposing the sanctions, the number of individuals and companies affected, and what the sanctions entail. Also, mentioning Trump's tweet and the administration's stance on the nuclear deal is important. On the flip side, Iran's denial and criticism of the U.S. should be included to show their perspective.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the main points without getting too detailed. The moral aspect is clear: the U.S. is acting against Iran's threatening behavior, while Iran dismisses the accusations.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first state the sanctions, the reasons, the targets, the administration's comments, Iran's response, and the context of the nuclear deal. I'll make sure to highlight the moral judgment by emphasizing Iran's threat to the region and the U.S. taking a tougher stance.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, citing Iran's ballistic missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John Smith stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to global stability, while Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that they "are not behaving." The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with the targeted individuals and companies. Iran denies violating UN regulations and dismisses Trump's criticism, with senior adviser Ali Akbar Velayati asserting that threats against Iran are ineffective. The sanctions focus on Iran's missile program and alleged terrorist support, separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but not abandoned. National security adviser Michael Flynn condemned Iran as the "worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism," while lawmakers praised the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration's strategy. END OF SUMMARY.
