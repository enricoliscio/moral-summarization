Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The user is a news summarizer assistant, so I need to make sure the summary is concise and captures all the key points. The article mentions the reasons for the sanctions, who is affected, and the reactions from both the U.S. and Iran. I should also include the nuclear deal aspect and the ongoing support for the sanctions by lawmakers, while noting some concerns about the administration's approach. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, ending with the specified tokens. Let me break down the main points and make sure each is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and support for rebels in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to regional and global stability. President Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that they "are playing with fire." The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with the sanctioned entities. While the measures do not affect the nuclear deal, which Trump previously criticized, they focus on Iran's missile activities and alleged terrorism support. Iran denies violating UN regulations and dismisses Trump's criticism, with senior adviser Ali Akbar Velayati calling the administration's threats ineffective. Lawmakers supported the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration's strategy toward Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
