SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program, which poses a threat to the region, partners worldwide, and the United States. The sanctions, which have been in the pipeline for months, affect 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing their property and funds under U.S. jurisdiction. The Treasury Department will continue to actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address this behavior. Trump signaled the sanctions, saying Iran is "playing with fire" and doesn't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them. The administration has put Iran "on notice" for its recent ballistic missile test and support for rebels in Yemen. The Treasury Department stated that this action reflects the United States' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism, saying threatening Iran will not work.

END OF SUMMARY.
