Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that the Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies. The reasons given are Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. John E. Smith from the Treasury Department mentions that Iran's support for terrorism and ballistic missile program is a threat. Trump himself commented that Iran is not behaving.

The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction. They don't affect the nuclear deal, which Trump criticized during the campaign but hasn't voided yet. The administration is using financial sanctions to address Iran's behavior, according to Smith.

Trump tweeted about Iran, comparing them unfavorably to Obama's approach. The sanctions were announced earlier in the week, citing Iran's missile test and support for the Houthis in Yemen. The Treasury Department emphasized their commitment to enforcing sanctions against Iran's missile program and destabilizing activities.

Iran denies violating UN regulations and mocks Trump's criticism. They believe the new administration will realize that threats don't work. The financial restrictions are separate from the nuclear agreement, which only lifted nuclear-related sanctions. The new sanctions target missile activities and alleged support for terrorist groups.

The individuals and companies sanctioned are linked to Iran's missile program or terrorist proxies like the Houthis. The review process started during the Obama administration. The acting Treasury Secretary is from the previous administration, and Trump's nominee is awaiting confirmation.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer noted that these sanctions were triggered by Iran's missile test and terrorist activities. Officials didn't comment on whether Trump plans to end the nuclear deal but pledged to monitor Iran. National security adviser Michael Flynn called Iran the leading state sponsor of terrorism, stating the international community has been too tolerant.

Lawmakers supported the sanctions but questioned the administration's tough rhetoric, urging clarity on strategy and avoiding ambiguous statements.

So, the key points are: new sanctions on Iran for missile tests and Yemen support, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing assets; no impact on nuclear deal; Trump's criticism and tweet; Iran's denial and criticism of Trump; sanctions are separate from nuclear deal; targeting missile and terrorist activities; officials are from Obama's administration; Spicer's comments on triggers; Flynn's statement; lawmakers' support but concerns about rhetoric.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."
