Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article about the Trump administration imposing sanctions on Iran. They want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what moral framing means here. It refers to words that carry a positive or negative moral judgment. 

Looking at the article, I should identify words that have a moral connotation. Words like "terrorism," "provocations," "threat," "unjust," "empty," "baseless," "unjustified," "unwise," "exacerbate," "tolerate," "unjust," "unfair," "unjustified," "unwise," "exacerbate," "tolerate," "unjust," "unfair," "unjustified," "unwise," "exacerbate," "tolerate." These words are used to convey judgment about Iran's actions and the US's response.

Next, I need to write a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should capture the main points: the sanctions, the reasons (missile tests, support for rebels), the moral stance against Iran's actions, and the reactions from Iran and US officials.

I should structure the summary to include the key elements: who imposed the sanctions, why, what the sanctions target, the moral judgment against Iran, and the response from both sides. Also, mention that the sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal and that the administration is committed to enforcing them.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral tone from the original text. I'll start by stating the administration's action, then the reasons, followed by the details of the sanctions, reactions, and the administration's stance on the nuclear deal. Finally, include the support from lawmakers but also their caution about rhetoric.

Let me make sure I include all the key points without going over the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and that the moral words are appropriately included.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting individuals and companies linked to its ballistic missile program and support for rebels in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran’s "terrorism" and missile development pose a threat to global stability. Trump criticized Iran’s behavior, tweeting that they were "playing with fire." The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with sanctioned entities. Iran denied violating UN regulations, dismissing Trump’s criticism as "empty and baseless." The sanctions focus on missile activity and alleged terrorist support, separate from the nuclear deal. National security adviser Michael Flynn called Iran "the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism," emphasizing the administration’s intolerance of its "provocations." Lawmakers supported the sanctions but urged clarity on strategy and cautioned against "provocative tweets" that could worsen tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
