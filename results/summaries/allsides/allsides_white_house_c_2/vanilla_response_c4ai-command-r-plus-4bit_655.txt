SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies in response to Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions freeze any property or funds they may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with those on the sanctions list. The Treasury Department stated that the sanctions reflect the U.S.'s commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. The sanctions target 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies linked to Iran's missile program and/or proxies for terrorist activity. The administration also pledged to continue enforcing sanctions on Iran and to address its "bad behavior." Lawmakers generally supported the sanctions but questioned the administration's ambiguous rhetoric towards Iran. The sanctions do not directly address the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump criticized during his campaign.
END OF SUMMARY.
