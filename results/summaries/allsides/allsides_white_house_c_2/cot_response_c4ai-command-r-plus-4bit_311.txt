SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels as reasons. The sanctions freeze any property or funds these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, stated that Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorism pose a threat to the U.S. and its partners. The sanctions were triggered by an Iranian missile test and terrorist activities, according to White House spokesman Sean Spicer. National security adviser Michael Flynn called Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism" and criticized the international community for being too tolerant of Iran's bad behavior. The Trump administration pledged to keep a close eye on Iran and not tolerate its provocations. Lawmakers generally supported the sanctions but questioned the administration's ambiguous rhetoric and provocative tweets towards Iran. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to Iran's missile program and terrorist proxies. They are outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal but deal with missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups. END OF SUMMARY.
