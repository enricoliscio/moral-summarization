Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The reasons given are Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. They mention that these actions pose a threat to the region and the US. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting transactions with them. The author uses words like "terrorism," "threat," "sanctions," and "provocations," which are morally charged.

I should make sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key points: the sanctions, the reasons behind them, who is affected, and the reactions from both the US and Iran.

I'll structure the summary to first state the action (sanctions), then the reasons (missile tests, terrorism support), mention the individuals and companies targeted, and note that it's outside the nuclear deal. I should also include Trump's tweet and Flynn's statement about Iran's behavior. Finally, I'll add that lawmakers support the sanctions but want a clear strategy.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the important morally framed terms without making it too long. Let me draft it step by step, checking word count as I go.

SUMMARY:  
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and alleged support for terrorism. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's missile tests and destabilizing activities in Yemen pose a threat to regional and global security. President Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that they are "playing with fire." The sanctions freeze assets and prohibit U.S. transactions with those on the list, reflecting the administration's commitment to enforcing measures against Iran's provocative actions. National security adviser Michael Flynn emphasized Iran as the "worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism," urging the international community to no longer tolerate its bad behavior. While lawmakers supported the sanctions, they called for clarity on the administration's strategy toward Iran, cautioning against ambiguous rhetoric that could exacerbate tensions. The sanctions focus on Iran's missile activity and proxy groups like the Houthis, separate from the nuclear deal, which the administration has not yet voided. END OF SUMMARY.
