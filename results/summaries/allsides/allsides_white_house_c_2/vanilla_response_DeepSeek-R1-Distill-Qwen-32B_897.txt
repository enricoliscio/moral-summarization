Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that the Trump administration is imposing new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies. The reasons given are Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. John E. Smith from the Treasury Department mentions that Iran's support for terrorism and ballistic missile program is a threat.

President Trump comments that Iran isn't behaving, and the sanctions have been in the works for months. They don't mention the nuclear deal, which Trump criticized during his campaign but hasn't acted on yet. Smith says they'll continue using all tools, including financial sanctions.

The sanctions affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets in the U.S. Trump tweeted about Iran playing with fire, comparing Obama's kindness to his approach. The administration cited Iran's missile test and support for the Houthis in Yemen.

The Treasury Department's statement says the sanctions enforce measures against Iran's missile program and regional destabilization. Iran denies violating UN regulations and mocks Trump. The sanctions are outside the nuclear deal, which only dealt with nuclear-related issues. The targeted individuals and companies are linked to Iran's missile program or terrorist proxies.

The Treasury is led by Szubin from the Obama era. Spicer says the sanctions were triggered by missile tests and terrorism. Officials didn't comment on the nuclear deal but plan to monitor Iran. Flynn calls Iran the top state sponsor of terrorism. Lawmakers support the sanctions but want clarity on the strategy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: new sanctions, reasons, who's affected, reactions from Iran, relation to nuclear deal, and the administration's stance.

Let me structure it: Trump admin imposes sanctions on Iran for missile tests and supporting rebels. Sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing assets. Iran denies violations and mocks Trump. Sanctions don't affect nuclear deal, which only covers nuclear issues. Administration uses financial tools to address Iran's behavior. Lawmakers support but want strategy clarity.

I should make sure to include all main elements without going over the word limit. Also, end with the required tokens.
