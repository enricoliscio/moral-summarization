SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions are a response to Iran's "continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program," which poses a "threat" to the region, partners worldwide, and the United States. The Treasury Department will "actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address this behavior." The sanctions affect 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing their property and funds under U.S. jurisdiction. Trump signaled the sanctions with a tweet, warning Iran that it is "playing with fire" and that he will not be as "kind" as President Obama. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism. The Treasury Department emphasized that these sanctions deal with Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups, and are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement. Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions, but questioned the administration's sabre-rattling toward Iran.
