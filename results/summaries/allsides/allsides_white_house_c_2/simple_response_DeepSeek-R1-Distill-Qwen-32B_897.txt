Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the underlying moral stance.

The article discusses the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The reasons given are Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The moral framing here is about Iran's threat to regional and global security, their support for terrorism, and their destabilizing activities.

I should note the key points: who is imposing the sanctions, the reasons, who is affected, and the reactions from both the U.S. and Iran. Also, it's important to mention that these sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which is a point of contention between Trump and Iran.

The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll structure it to first state the action taken by the Trump administration, then the reasons, followed by the specifics of the sanctions, and then the reactions from both sides.

I should also highlight the moral judgment by emphasizing terms like "threat," "terrorism," "destabilizing activities," and the U.S. commitment to enforcing sanctions. It's crucial to maintain the tone that Iran's actions are problematic and that the U.S. is taking necessary measures to address them.

I'll make sure to include the number of individuals and companies sanctioned, the freezing of assets, and the prohibition on transactions. Also, mentioning Trump's tweet adds context about his perspective on Iran's behavior compared to the previous administration.

Finally, I'll touch on Iran's denial of violating UN regulations and their criticism of Trump, as well as the U.S. officials' statements about not tolerating Iran's provocations. This balances the summary with both perspectives but maintains the moral framing from the article.

Now, I'll condense all these points into a coherent, concise summary that meets the word limit and preserves the moral stance presented in the original text.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, citing Iran's ballistic missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen, such as the Houthis. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to regional and global security, emphasizing the U.S. commitment to combating terrorism and destabilizing activities. The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with sanctioned entities. Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that they "are playing with fire," and his administration has vowed to no longer tolerate Iran's provocations. Iran denies violating UN regulations and has mocked Trump's criticism, asserting that threats will not work. The sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which the U.S. has not yet voided, though Trump has questioned its verification. U.S. officials have linked the sanctioned individuals and companies to Iran's missile program and terrorist proxies, signaling a long-term strategy to counter Iran's activities. END OF SUMMARY.
