SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The Treasury Department's acting director, John E. Smith, stated that Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region, partners worldwide, and the United States. Trump tweeted that "Iran is playing with fire" and that they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism, calling him "inexperienced" and saying his "empty and baseless ranting" should stop. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under US jurisdiction. The administration has pledged to keep a close eye on Iran, calling it "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism" and vowing to no longer tolerate its "bad behavior" and "provocations".
END OF SUMMARY.
