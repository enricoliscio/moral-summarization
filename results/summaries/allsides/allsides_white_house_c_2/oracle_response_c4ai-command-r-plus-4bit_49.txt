SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as evidence of its continued support for terrorism and destabilizing activities in the region. The sanctions freeze any property or funds under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with those on the sanctions list. These actions reflect the U.S. commitment to addressing Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate UN regulations and criticized the president's threats, claiming that the U.S. has been too tolerant of Iran's behavior in the past. The sanctions target individuals and companies linked to Iran's missile program and terrorist proxies, and are intended to address Iran's threat to U.S. interests and partners worldwide. National security adviser Michael Flynn emphasized that the Trump administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations and threatening behavior. While lawmakers applauded the sanctions, they also urged the administration to provide clarity on their overall strategy towards Iran and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric.
END OF SUMMARY.
