SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions freeze any property or funds under US jurisdiction and prohibit US persons from engaging in transactions with those on the list. The Treasury Department stated that the action reflects the US' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. The sanctions are separate from the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but shown no signs of voiding. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism. Lawmakers have generally applauded the sanctions, but questioned the administration's sabre-rattling towards Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
