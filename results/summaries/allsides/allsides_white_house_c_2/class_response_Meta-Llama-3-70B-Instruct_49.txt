SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as a threat to the region and the United States. The sanctions, which have been in the pipeline for months, target 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The administration claims that Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to global interests. Trump warned that Iran is "playing with fire" and that his administration will not tolerate its "bad behavior." The sanctions are seen as a way to address Iran's destabilizing activities in the region, and officials have pledged to keep a close eye on the regime. Lawmakers have applauded the move, but some have cautioned against sabre-rattling and ambiguous rhetoric that could exacerbate tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
