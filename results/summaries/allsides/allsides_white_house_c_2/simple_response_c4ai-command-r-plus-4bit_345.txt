SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as justification. These sanctions, which have been in the works for months, aim to address Iran's ballistic missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups. The sanctions freeze any property or funds that the targeted individuals and companies may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. 

Trump and his aides have criticized Iran's actions, with Trump stating that Iran is "playing with fire." The administration has also accused Iran of being the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and has pledged to no longer tolerate its provocations. However, the sanctions do not address the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump criticized during his campaign. 

Iranian officials have denied that their missile tests violate U.N. regulations and have mocked Trump's criticism. The sanctions target individuals and companies linked to Iran's missile program and terrorist proxies, and officials emphasize that they are a result of an ongoing review of Iranian activity that began under the Obama administration. Lawmakers have generally supported the sanctions but have urged the administration to provide clarity on its overall strategy towards Iran and to refrain from provocative rhetoric.
