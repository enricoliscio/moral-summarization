SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as a "threat to the region, to our partners worldwide, and to the United States." The sanctions target 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Trump signaled the move with a tweet, warning Iran that it's "playing with fire" and that he's not as "kind" as President Obama was. Iranian officials have denied any wrongdoing and mocked Trump's criticism. The Treasury Department said the sanctions reflect the U.S.' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's "bad behavior" and "destabilizing activities" in the region. Lawmakers have applauded the move, but cautioned against "provocative" rhetoric that could exacerbate tensions. The administration has pledged to keep a close eye on Iran, which it calls "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism."
