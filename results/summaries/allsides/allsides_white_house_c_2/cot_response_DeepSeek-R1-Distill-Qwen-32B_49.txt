Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran, citing missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. They mention Iran's support for terrorism and ballistic missile program as threats. There's also mention of the nuclear deal and the administration's stance on it. 

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. Words like "sanctions," "terrorism," "provocations," "destabilizing," "unjust," "empty," "baseless," "inexperienced," "kind," "tolerance," "clarity," and "provocative" seem to carry moral judgments. These words are used to convey the administration's disapproval of Iran's actions.

Next, I'll write the summary. I'll make sure to include these moral terms to reflect the original framing. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and cover the key points: the sanctions, reasons behind them, reactions from Iran, the nuclear deal context, and the administration's stance. I'll also mention the lawmakers' response to ensure the summary is balanced.

I should structure the summary to first state the action (sanctions), then the reasons (terrorism, missile tests), followed by Iran's denial and criticism. Then, I'll touch on the nuclear deal context, the administration's commitment to enforcing sanctions, and the lawmakers' mixed reactions. Finally, I'll conclude with the administration's tough stance and the ongoing situation.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically and includes all necessary details without being too lengthy. I'll also check that I'm using the morally framed words appropriately to maintain the original tone and message of the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting individuals and companies linked to its ballistic missile program and support for terrorism in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to regional stability and U.S. interests. Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that they "are not behaving" and comparing their situation to the "kindness" of the Obama administration. The sanctions freeze assets and prohibit U.S. transactions with the targeted entities, focusing on Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups like the Houthis. Iran denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism, asserting that threats would not work. The sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but not revoked. National security adviser Michael Flynn condemned Iran as the "worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism," while lawmakers supported the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration's strategy. The administration emphasized its commitment to enforcing sanctions against Iran's destabilizing activities, signaling a tougher stance on Tehran's provocations. END OF SUMMARY.
