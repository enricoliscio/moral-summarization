SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The Treasury Department stated that the action reflects the US' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. The sanctions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement and target Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups. Trump administration officials have pledged to keep a close eye on the Iranian regime, with National Security Adviser Michael Flynn calling Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." Lawmakers have generally applauded the sanctions, but some have questioned the administration's sabre-rattling toward Iran.
