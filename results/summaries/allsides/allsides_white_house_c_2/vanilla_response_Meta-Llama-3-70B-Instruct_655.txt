SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions freeze any property or funds under US jurisdiction and prohibit US persons from engaging in transactions with those on the list. The Treasury Department stated that the action reflects the US' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. The sanctions are outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear agreement and deal with Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups. The Trump administration has pledged to keep a close eye on the Iranian regime, with National Security Adviser Michael Flynn calling Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." Lawmakers have generally applauded the sanctions, but some have questioned the administration's sabre-rattling toward Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
