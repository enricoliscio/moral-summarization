Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified certain morally charged words that I should include. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran because of missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. They mention terrorism, threats, and the need to address Iran's behavior. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting transactions.

I should highlight the key points: the reason for sanctions (missile tests, terrorism support), the impact (blocked assets, prohibited transactions), and the administration's stance on enforcing these measures. Also, include Iran's denial and the mention of the nuclear deal being separate from these sanctions.

I need to make sure to use as many of the provided morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long. Keeping it concise but comprehensive is important. Let me structure the summary to cover the main actions, the reasons behind them, and the reactions from both sides.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups like the Houthis in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran’s missile development and terrorist support pose a threat to regional stability and global partners. The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with the sanctioned entities. Trump criticized Iran’s behavior, tweeting that it is “playing with fire,” while emphasizing the administration’s commitment to enforcing sanctions. Iran denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump’s criticism, asserting that threats would not work. The sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which the administration has not voided. National security adviser Michael Flynn labeled Iran as the “world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism,” vowing to no longer tolerate its provocations. Lawmakers supported the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration’s strategy to avoid exacerbating tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
