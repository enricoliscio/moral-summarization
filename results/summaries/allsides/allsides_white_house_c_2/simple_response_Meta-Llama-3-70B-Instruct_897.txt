SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The move is seen as a warning to Iran, with Trump saying "Iran is playing with fire" and that they don't appreciate the kindness of former President Obama. The sanctions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement, focusing on Iran's missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups. The administration has pledged to keep a close eye on Iran, with National Security Adviser Michael Flynn calling it "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." While lawmakers have applauded the sanctions, some have cautioned against provocative rhetoric that could exacerbate tensions.
