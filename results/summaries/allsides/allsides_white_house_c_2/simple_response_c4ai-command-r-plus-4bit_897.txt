SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as evidence of their "continued support for terrorism and development of ballistic missiles." These sanctions freeze any property or funds the targeted entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. The move signals a tougher stance on Iran, with National Security Adviser Michael Flynn calling Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." The sanctions are outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal but focus on Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate UN regulations and criticized the U.S. for threatening behavior. Lawmakers have generally supported the sanctions but urged the administration to clarify its overall strategy towards Iran and refrain from ambiguous rhetoric.
END OF SUMMARY.
