SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program, which poses a threat to the region and the United States. The sanctions, which have been in the pipeline for months, affect 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under U.S. jurisdiction. The Treasury Department said the action reflects the United States' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism, calling it "empty and baseless ranting." The administration has pledged to continue applying all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address Iran's behavior, which Trump described as "not behaving." The sanctions are seen as a warning to Iran, with national security adviser Michael Flynn saying the Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations that threaten U.S. interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
