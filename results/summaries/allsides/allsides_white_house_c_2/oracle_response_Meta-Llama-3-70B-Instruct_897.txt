SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as a threat to the region and the United States. The sanctions, which have been in the pipeline for months, are a response to Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program. The Treasury Department has frozen any property or funds of the 13 individuals and 12 companies affected, and prohibited US persons from engaging in transactions with them. Trump signaled the sanctions with a tweet, warning Iran that it is "playing with fire" and that he will not be as "kind" as President Obama was. The administration has pledged to continue applying all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address Iran's behavior. National security adviser Michael Flynn called Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism" and vowed that the Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations that threaten US interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
