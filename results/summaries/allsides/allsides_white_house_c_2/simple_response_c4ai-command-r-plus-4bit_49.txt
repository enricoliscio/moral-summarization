SUMMARY: Trump's administration imposes new sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels as reasons. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, emphasizes the threat posed by Iran's ballistic missile program and terrorism sponsorship. The sanctions freeze any US-held property or funds of 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies and prohibit US transactions with those on the sanctions list. The administration aims to address Iran's destabilizing activities and ballistic missile program while upholding the Iranian nuclear deal. Michael Flynn, national security adviser, condemns Iran as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, vowing that the Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iranâ€™s provocations. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., calls for clarity in the administration's strategy towards Iran and refrains from ambiguous rhetoric.
