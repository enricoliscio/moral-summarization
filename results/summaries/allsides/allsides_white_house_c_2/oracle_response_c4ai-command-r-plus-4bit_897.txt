SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's continued support for terrorism, the development of its ballistic missile program, and its threatening behavior in the region. The sanctions freeze any property or funds under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with those on the sanctions list. These actions reflect the United States' commitment to addressing Iran's destabilizing activities and enforcing sanctions related to its ballistic missile program. 

The Trump administration has signaled a tougher stance on Iran, accusing the country of playing with fire and threatening U.S. interests. In response, Iranian officials have mocked the president and denied any wrongdoing, claiming that their missile tests do not violate U.N. regulations. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has called Iran the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and criticized the international community for being too tolerant of Iran's behavior. These sanctions are a way to address Iran's provocations and hold them accountable for their actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
