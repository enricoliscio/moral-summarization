SUMMARY:

The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program, which poses a threat to the region and the United States. The sanctions, which affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, aim to address Iran's destabilizing activities in the region. Trump signaled the sanctions, saying Iran is "playing with fire" and not appreciating the kindness of President Obama. The Treasury Department emphasized the United States' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism, saying threatening Iran will not work. The sanctions are outside the scope of the nuclear agreement, which only dealt with nuclear-related sanctions. Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions, but urged the administration to bring clarity to its overall strategy towards Iran and refrain from ambiguous rhetoric that could exacerbate efforts to confront challenges.

END OF SUMMARY.
