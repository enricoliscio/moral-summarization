SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels as evidence of its continued involvement in terrorism and ballistic missile development. The sanctions freeze the assets of 13 individuals and 12 companies, with the aim of addressing Iran's threatening behavior and destabilizing activities in the region. 

According to the Treasury Department, these sanctions reflect the US commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran and countering its support for terrorist groups and ballistic missile program. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate UN regulations and has mocked President Trump's criticism. The sanctions are outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but not voided. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has called Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism," and the administration has vowed to no longer tolerate Iran's provocations. 

The sanctions have been generally applauded by lawmakers, but some have questioned the administration's ambiguous rhetoric and sabre-rattling toward Iran, urging a clearer strategy to confront the challenges posed by Iran.
END OF SUMMARY.
