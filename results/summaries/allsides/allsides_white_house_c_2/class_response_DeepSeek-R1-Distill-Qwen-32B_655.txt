Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read the article carefully. It's about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The author uses several morally charged words like "missile tests," "terrorism," "threat," and "provocations." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The article mentions the sanctions are due to Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The Treasury Department's John Smith says these actions pose a threat. Trump also tweets about Iran playing with fire, comparing Obama's kindness to his own approach. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting transactions with U.S. persons.

I should note that the sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump criticized during the campaign. The administration is focusing on missile programs and terrorism support. Iran denies violating UN regulations and dismisses Trump's criticism. The sanctions are part of enforcing against destabilizing activities, and the Treasury is led by an Obama appointee.

Lawmakers support the sanctions but caution against ambiguous rhetoric. The summary needs to include all these points concisely, using the moral terms provided. I'll structure it to highlight the reasons for sanctions, the administration's stance, Iran's response, and the implications of the sanctions without the nuclear deal.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points and ensure all morally framed words are included. Let me draft the summary, making sure to cover each aspect without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and alleged support for terrorism. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's missile development and destabilizing activities in the region pose a threat to global partners and the U.S. President Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting that it is "playing with fire." The sanctions block U.S. jurisdiction over Iranian assets and prohibit transactions with those on the list, reflecting the administration's commitment to enforcing measures against Iran's missile tests and support for groups like the Houthis in Yemen. Iran denies violating UN regulations and dismisses Trump's rhetoric, with senior adviser Ali Akbar Velayati asserting that threats will not work. The sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but not voided. National security adviser Michael Flynn labeled Iran "the worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism," while lawmakers praised the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration's strategy. The move aims to address Iran's provocative behavior and enforce accountability for its destabilizing activities. END OF SUMMARY.
