SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The administration claims that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region, partners worldwide, and the United States. Trump stated that "Iran is playing with fire" and that they "don't appreciate how 'kind' President Obama was to them." The sanctions affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The administration has pledged to "actively apply all available tools" to address Iran's "bad behavior." National security adviser Michael Flynn labeled Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism" and vowed that the Trump administration will no longer "tolerate Iran's provocations." Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions but urged the administration to clarify its strategy and refrain from "ambiguous rhetoric" and "provocative tweets."
END OF SUMMARY.
