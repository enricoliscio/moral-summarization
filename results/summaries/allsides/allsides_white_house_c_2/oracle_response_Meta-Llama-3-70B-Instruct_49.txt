SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing the Tehran government's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program, which poses a threat to the region, partners worldwide, and the United States. The sanctions, which affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, reflect the United States' commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran with respect to its ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. Trump signaled the sanctions, stating that Iran is "playing with fire" and not behaving. The Treasury Department will continue to actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address this behavior. The administration has pledged to keep a close eye on the regime, with national security adviser Michael Flynn calling Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism" and vowing that the Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations that threaten US interests. END OF SUMMARY.
