SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies in response to Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. John E. Smith, the acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region and the world. The sanctions freeze any property or funds that the targeted entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. These sanctions are separate from the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized in the past. The Treasury Department stated that the sanctions reflect the U.S.'s commitment to enforcing sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate U.N. regulations and criticized Trump's actions. The financial restrictions are related to Iran's missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups. The sanctions target individuals and companies linked to these activities. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn stated that the Trump administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations. END OF SUMMARY.
