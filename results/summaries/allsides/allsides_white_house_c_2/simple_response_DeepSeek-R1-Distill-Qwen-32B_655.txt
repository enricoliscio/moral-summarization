Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The reasons given are Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets in the U.S. It also mentions that these sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized before but hasn't acted on yet.

I need to capture the moral stance here. The U.S. is framing Iran as a threat due to terrorism and missile programs. They're using terms like "bad behavior" and "provocations." Iran, on the other hand, is dismissing these accusations, calling them baseless and inexperienced.

I should make sure the summary includes the key points: who imposed the sanctions, why, who is affected, and the reaction from Iran. Also, note that the nuclear deal isn't being targeted here. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing—so highlighting the U.S. perspective on Iran's threats and Iran's dismissal.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the administration's action, the reasons, the specifics of the sanctions, Iran's denial, and the context of the nuclear deal. Also, include the officials' comments to emphasize the moral judgment.

I should avoid getting into too much detail about the nuclear deal, just mention it's separate. Also, include Trump's tweet and Flynn's statement about Iran's sponsorship of terrorism to show the moral stance.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise summary without exceeding 200 words. Make sure to include all necessary elements and maintain the original moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on 13 Iranian individuals and 12 companies, citing Iran's ballistic missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as threats to regional stability and U.S. interests. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith emphasized Iran's "continued support for terrorism" and its missile program as justification. The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with those targeted. While the sanctions do not affect the nuclear deal, which Trump criticized during his campaign, the administration has pledged to use all tools to address Iran's behavior. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and dismissed Trump's criticism as baseless. National security adviser Michael Flynn described Iran as "the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism," signaling the administration's intolerance of its provocations. Lawmakers supported the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration's strategy toward Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
