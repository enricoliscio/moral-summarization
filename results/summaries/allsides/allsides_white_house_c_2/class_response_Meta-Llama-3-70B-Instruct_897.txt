SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Tehran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as a threat to the region and the United States. The sanctions, which affect 13 individuals and 12 companies, aim to address Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program. The Treasury Department emphasized that the US will continue to enforce sanctions on Iran with respect to its destabilizing activities in the region. Trump signaled the sanctions, warning Iran that it is "playing with fire" and that the US will no longer tolerate its provocations. Iran has denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism, calling it "empty and baseless ranting." Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions, but urged the administration to clarify its strategy towards Iran and refrain from ambiguous rhetoric that may exacerbate tensions. The sanctions are seen as a warning to Iran to change its behavior and cease its threatening activities. END OF SUMMARY.
