Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully. 

The article is about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. They mention missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The author uses words like "terrorism," "threat," and "provocations," which are morally charged. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll identify the main points: sanctions on individuals and companies, reasons being missile tests and support for rebels. The administration's stance is that Iran's actions pose a threat. They're enforcing sanctions, and there's a mention of the nuclear deal, which isn't being voided. Iran denies violations and criticizes Trump. The sanctions target missile programs and terrorism support, separate from the nuclear deal. There's also criticism from lawmakers about the administration's rhetoric.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll structure it by stating the sanctions, reasons, who's affected, Iran's response, and the nuclear deal context. I'll include the morally framed words like "terrorism," "threat," "sanctions," "provocations," etc.

Let me draft it: The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Iran due to missile tests and supporting rebels in Yemen, framing it as a threat. The sanctions target individuals and companies linked to missile programs and terrorism. Iran denied violations and criticized Trump. The nuclear deal remains intact, but these sanctions are separate. Lawmakers support the move but caution against provocative rhetoric.

Wait, I need to include more details. Maybe mention the number of individuals and companies, the freezing of assets, and the administration's commitment to enforcing sanctions. Also, note that the sanctions are outside the nuclear deal and that officials are reviewing Iranian activities from the Obama era.

I should also include the quote from Trump's tweet about Iran playing with fire and comparing Obama's kindness. The national security adviser's statement about Iran being a leading state sponsor of terrorism is important too.

Putting it all together, ensuring the moral words are included and the summary is concise.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and support for terrorism. The sanctions, which freeze assets and prohibit transactions under U.S. jurisdiction, were justified as a response to Iran's destabilizing activities, including missile tests and backing for rebels in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith emphasized the U.S. commitment to enforcing sanctions against Iran's provocative behavior. President Trump criticized Iran's actions, tweeting that they are "playing with fire," while Iran denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's rhetoric. The sanctions, which do not affect the nuclear deal, focus on missile development and alleged terrorist support, reflecting the administration's intolerance of Iran's threats to regional stability. Lawmakers supported the move but urged clarity on the administration's strategy to avoid exacerbating tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
