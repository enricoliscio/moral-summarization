SUMMARY: 
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels. John E. Smith of the Treasury Department stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to the region and the world. These sanctions freeze any property or funds under U.S. jurisdiction and restrict transactions with those on the sanctions list. The administration's actions are a response to Iran's "threatening" behavior, including its support for "terrorism" and ballistic missile program. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn emphasized that the previous administration had been too tolerant of Iran's "bad behavior" and provocations. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to Iran's missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups. While the Iranian nuclear deal remains intact, these sanctions address separate issues. The Trump administration's stance has been applauded by lawmakers, but they have also urged for clarity in the overall strategy towards Iran and cautioned against ambiguous rhetoric and "provocative tweets."
