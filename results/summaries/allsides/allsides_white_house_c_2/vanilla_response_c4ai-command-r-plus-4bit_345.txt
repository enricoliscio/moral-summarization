SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as justification. These sanctions freeze any property or funds the sanctioned entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. The move comes after Trump's criticism of Iran's behavior and his tweet stating that Iran is "playing with fire." The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to Iran's missile program and/or proxies for terrorist activity. The Treasury Department stated that these sanctions reflect the U.S.'s commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities. Iranian officials have denied that their missile tests violate U.N. regulations and have mocked Trump's criticism. The sanctions are outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but not voided. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn called Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism" and stated that the Trump administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations. Lawmakers applauded the sanctions but urged the administration to clarify their overall strategy towards Iran and refrain from ambiguous rhetoric.
END OF SUMMARY.
