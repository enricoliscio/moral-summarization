SUMMARY: The Trump administration announced new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as evidence of their continued support for terrorism and development of ballistic missile programs. These actions pose a threat to the region, our partners worldwide, and the United States. The sanctions freeze any property or funds the targeted entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. 

The administration's decision reflects a commitment to enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities in the region. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate U.N. regulations and has mocked the president's criticism. 

These sanctions are outside the scope of the Iranian nuclear deal and deal specifically with Iran's missile activity and alleged support for terrorist groups. The Trump administration has signaled that it will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations and threatening behavior, and will continue to address these issues through the application of sanctions and other available tools. 

Lawmakers generally supported the sanctions but urged the administration to provide clarity on their overall strategy towards Iran and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric or provocative statements that could exacerbate tensions. 

END OF SUMMARY.
