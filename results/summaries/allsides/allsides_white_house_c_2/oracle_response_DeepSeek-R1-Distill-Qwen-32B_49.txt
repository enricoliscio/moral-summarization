Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The reasons given are Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. They mention that these actions pose a threat to the region and the US. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets under US jurisdiction. The administration emphasizes their commitment to enforcing these sanctions against Iran's missile program and destabilizing activities.

I should note the morally charged words the author used: continued, support, terrorism, development, threat, behaving, apply, sanctions, address, playing, action, commitment, program, activities, threatening, ranting, sponsor, tolerant, behavior, tolerate, provocations, threaten, clarity, refrain, exacerbate, confront.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll start by stating the imposition of sanctions, the reasons, and the impact. Then, I'll include the administration's commitment and the specifics of the sanctions. I'll also mention Iran's denial and the nuclear deal context. Finally, I'll touch on the lawmakers' reactions.

I should ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral framing by using words like "continues," "supports," "terrorism," "threat," "sanctions," "address," "commitment," "provocations," etc.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and support for terrorism, particularly the Houthis in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John Smith emphasized Iran's "continued support for terrorism" and its "development of ballistic missile programs," which pose a "threat" to global stability. President Trump criticized Iran's "bad behavior," signaling a tougher stance than the Obama administration. The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with sanctioned entities. The administration's "action" reflects its "commitment" to addressing Iran's "destabilizing activities." Iran denies violating UN regulations and dismisses Trump's criticism as "empty ranting." The sanctions focus on non-nuclear issues, as the nuclear deal remains intact. National security adviser Michael Flynn labeled Iran "the worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism," asserting the U.S. would no longer "tolerate" its "provocations." Lawmakers supported the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration's strategy to avoid "exacerbating" tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
