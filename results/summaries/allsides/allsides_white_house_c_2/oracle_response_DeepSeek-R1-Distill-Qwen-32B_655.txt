Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on Iran. The author used specific morally charged words, so I should include as many of those as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The sanctions are due to Iran's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The author mentions terms like "continued support for terrorism," "development of ballistic missile program," and "threat to the region." These are key moral points.

I should note that the sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets. The administration is emphasizing their commitment to enforcing sanctions, which ties into words like "address," "apply," and "action." Also, Trump's tweet about Iran playing with fire and comparing Obama's kindness is a moral statement.

The article also mentions that the sanctions don't affect the nuclear deal, but the administration is still critical of Iran's other activities. Iran denies violating UN regulations and mocks Trump. There's criticism from lawmakers about the administration's approach, using terms like "clarity" and "exacerbate."

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll structure it to first state the action (sanctions), the reasons (support for terrorism, missile program), the targets, and the administration's stance. Then mention Iran's response and the criticism from lawmakers.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically and includes the key moral terms without making it too verbose. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and support for terrorism. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran’s "continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region and the United States." Trump criticized Iran’s behavior, tweeting, "Iran is playing with fire." The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with those on the list. While the measures do not affect the nuclear deal, the administration emphasized its "commitment to enforcing sanctions" on Iran’s "destabilizing activities." Iran denies violating UN regulations and mocked Trump’s criticism, with senior adviser Ali Akbar Velayati calling the administration’s threats "empty and baseless." The sanctions reflect the U.S. government’s intolerance of Iran’s "provocations" and "bad behavior," as national security adviser Michael Flynn labeled Iran "the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism." Lawmakers praised the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration’s strategy to avoid "exacerbating" tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
