SUMMARY: The Trump administration announced new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as justification. The sanctions freeze any property or funds these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. The move was prompted by Iran's missile test and support for terrorist activities. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to Iran's missile program and proxies for terrorist groups. Officials stated that Iran's actions pose a threat to the U.S. and its partners, and that the U.S. will continue to enforce sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate UN regulations and criticized President Trump's response. The sanctions are unrelated to the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump has criticized but not voided. Lawmakers generally supported the sanctions but urged the administration to clarify its overall strategy towards Iran and refrain from ambiguous rhetoric.
END OF SUMMARY.
