SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as reasons. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, emphasized the threat Iran poses to the region and the world. The sanctions freeze any property or funds the targeted individuals and companies may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. The administration's actions are a response to Iran's alleged support for terrorism and its ballistic missile program, with National Security Adviser Michael Flynn calling Iran "the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism." The sanctions specifically target those linked to Iran's missile program and/or proxies for terrorist activity. While the Iranian nuclear deal was not directly mentioned in the sanctions, the administration pledged to continue enforcing sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program and destabilizing activities. Iran has denied that its missile tests violate UN regulations and criticized the president's threats. This move by the Trump administration reflects a tougher stance on Iran and a commitment to addressing its perceived threats and destabilizing actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
