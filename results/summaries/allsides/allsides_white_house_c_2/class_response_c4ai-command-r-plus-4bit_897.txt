SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing their recent missile tests and support for Yemeni rebels as evidence of Iran's threatening behavior. These sanctions aim to address Iran's ballistic missile development and support for terrorism, with 13 individuals and 12 companies affected. John E. Smith, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, emphasized the threat Iran poses to the region and the world. The sanctions freeze any funds or property these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with them. President Trump warned Iran that his administration will not be as lenient as his predecessor's, stating that Iran is "playing with fire." Iranian officials have mocked and dismissed these threats, claiming that their missile tests do not violate UN regulations. The sanctions specifically target entities linked to Iran's missile program and support for terrorist groups, reflecting the U.S. commitment to enforcing sanctions and addressing destabilizing activities in the region. Lawmakers have applauded the sanctions but urged the administration to provide clarity on their overall strategy towards Iran and refrain from ambiguous rhetoric. 

END OF SUMMARY.
