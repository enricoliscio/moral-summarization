Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Trump administration is imposing new sanctions on Iran due to missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. They're framing this as Iran threatening regional and global security, especially through terrorism and missile development. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets. The author uses words like "terrorism," "threat," "sanctions," and "provocations," so I need to include these.

I should start by identifying the key elements: who imposed the sanctions, why, who they target, and the implications. Also, note that the sanctions don't affect the nuclear deal but focus on missile and terrorist activities. The moral framing is strong, so I'll use words like "threat," "terrorism," "provocations," and "enforcing sanctions."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it: mention the administration, the reason, the targets, the effect, and the context about the nuclear deal. Also, include the reactions from Iran and the U.S. officials. Make sure to include the morally charged terms without making it too lengthy.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Maybe start with the administration's action, then the reasons, who's affected, and the broader implications. Also, mention that the sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal. Conclude with the administration's stance on Iran's behavior.

Let me draft this, making sure to include all the necessary points and the moral language. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise. Okay, that should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing as requested.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and alleged support for terrorist groups like the Houthis in Yemen. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's "terrorism" and missile development pose a "threat" to global security, emphasizing the need to "address" this behavior through financial "sanctions." The sanctions block U.S. jurisdiction over Iranian assets and prohibit transactions with those on the list. Trump criticized Iran's "provocative" actions, tweeting that they are "playing with fire." Iran denies violating UN regulations and dismissed Trump's criticism as "empty ranting." The sanctions, which do not affect the nuclear deal, aim to "enforce" restrictions on Iran's "destabilizing activities." National security adviser Michael Flynn condemned Iran as the "worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism," while some lawmakers urged clarity on the administration's strategy. The move reflects a broader effort to "confront" Iran's "bad behavior" and "provocations" that threaten U.S. interests. END OF SUMMARY.
