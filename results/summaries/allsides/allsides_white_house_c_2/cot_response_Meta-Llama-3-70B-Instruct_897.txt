SUMMARY:
The Trump administration has imposed new economic sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing Iran's recent missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen as "bad behavior" that poses a threat to the region and the United States. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with them. The administration claims that Iran's actions are "playing with fire” and that the country is not “behaving” properly. Iran has denied any wrongdoing and mocked the president's criticism, calling it “empty and baseless ranting.” The sanctions are seen as a warning to Iran, with the administration vowing to “no longer tolerate” its “provocations.” Lawmakers have applauded the move, but urged the administration to clarify its strategy towards Iran and refrain from “ambiguous rhetoric” that could exacerbate tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
