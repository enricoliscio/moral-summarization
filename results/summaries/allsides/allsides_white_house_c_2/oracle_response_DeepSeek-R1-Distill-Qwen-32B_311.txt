Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Trump administration is imposing new sanctions on Iran because of their missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. They're emphasizing Iran's support for terrorism and ballistic missile program as threats. The sanctions target 13 individuals and 12 companies, freezing their assets. The article mentions that these sanctions are separate from the nuclear deal, which Trump criticized but hasn't voided yet. There's also some criticism from Iran and some lawmakers questioning the administration's approach.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating the imposition of sanctions, citing the reasons. Then, mention the number of individuals and companies affected. Highlight that the sanctions are about missile programs and terrorism, not the nuclear deal. Include Trump's tweet and Flynn's comments on Iran's behavior. Note the administration's commitment to enforcing sanctions and the criticism from Iran and lawmakers. Make sure to use the morally framed words like "continued support," "terrorism," "threat," "sanctions," "address," "provocations," etc.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main action, reasons, affected parties, and then the implications and reactions. Keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure to include all key points and the moral language. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure it doesn't exceed 200 words. After drafting, I'll review to include as many of the specified moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, targeting 13 individuals and 12 companies linked to its ballistic missile program and alleged support for terrorism. Acting Treasury Director John E. Smith stated that Iran's "continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region and the United States." Trump criticized Iran's behavior, tweeting, "Iran is playing with fire." The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit transactions with those on the list, reflecting the administration's commitment to addressing Iran's destabilizing activities. National security adviser Michael Flynn called Iran "the worldâ€™s leading state sponsor of terrorism," stating the U.S. would no longer tolerate its provocations. Iran denied violating UN regulations and mocked Trump's criticism. Lawmakers supported the sanctions but urged clarity on the administration's strategy to avoid exacerbating tensions. The sanctions focus on Iran's missile activity and terrorism allegations, separate from the nuclear deal. END OF SUMMARY.
