SUMMARY: In the ongoing debate over gun control in the United States, recent developments at the state level have resulted in a mixed bag of outcomes for both proponents and opponents of stricter gun laws. While the NRA scored victories in Kansas and Maine with the passage of permitless concealed carry laws, gun control advocates celebrated the enactment of background check laws in six additional states, bringing the total to 18. The California protective-order law, designed to prevent incidents like the 2014 Isla Vista shooting, is hailed as a significant win for gun control advocates, allowing police and family members to take action against individuals displaying disturbing behavior. Despite setbacks in some states, advocates for stricter gun laws have claimed momentum since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, and have successfully blocked NRA-backed campus-carry laws in 14 states. The battle over gun laws at the state level has intensified, with both sides pushing harder for their respective agendas. While gun control advocates aim to restrict access in blue and purple states, the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people in more places is the solution to mass shootings. The article concludes that the fight over gun legislation in the US remains a highly contested issue with no clear winner.
