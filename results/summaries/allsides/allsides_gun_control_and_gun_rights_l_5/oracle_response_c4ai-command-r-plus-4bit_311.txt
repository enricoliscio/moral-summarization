SUMMARY: In the ongoing battle over gun control in the United States, advocates for stricter laws are claiming momentum, despite a recent failed push at the federal level. While the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without permits, gun control supporters have made gains at the state level, with an additional six states enacting background check laws since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. They have also successfully fought against NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protected legislators targeted by the NRA. The passage of a California protective-order law, designed to prevent incidents like the 2014 shooting rampage in Isla Vista, is hailed as a significant win for gun control advocates. Both sides are intensifying their efforts, with gun control advocates restricting access in blue and purple states, and the NRA arguing for arming more people in more places. Despite setbacks, gun control advocates are proud to have stopped campus-carry laws in 14 out of 16 states where bills were introduced. The battle over gun laws in the US remains a highly contested issue, with both sides claiming victories and working to advance their agendas.
END OF SUMMARY.
