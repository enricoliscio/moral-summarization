Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about the ongoing debate over gun control in the U.S., focusing on recent developments and the efforts of both sides.

The user mentioned that the assistant should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a list of morally framed words used by the author, such as "massacre," "fighting," "expand," etc. My task is to make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the original moral perspective.

First, I'll identify the key points. The article discusses the push for stricter gun control since the Sandy Hook massacre, the NRA's influence, new state laws, and specific examples like California's protective-order law. It also mentions the NRA's victories in states like Kansas and Maine and the ongoing battles over campus carry laws.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the deadlock, using "massacre" to highlight the tragedy. Then, I'll note the progress in some states and the NRA's counteractions. Including terms like "fighting," "expand," and "protecting" will show the struggle between the two sides.

I should also mention specific examples, like California's law, using words like "infringe" and "restrict" to show the concerns. The NRA's push for arming more places is another key point, using "shootings" and "enact." Finally, I'll note the successes of gun-control advocates in stopping certain laws, using "stopping" and "enact."

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, covering both sides' efforts and the moral implications without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise and within the limit. Also, I'll make sure to end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The ongoing debate over gun control in the U.S. remains a moral and political standoff. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, gun-control advocates have gained momentum, with 18 states enacting background check laws and successes in fighting NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights. Advocates like Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action feel a newfound sense of momentum, though the NRA has scored victories in states like Kansas and Maine, where concealed carry without permits is now allowed. Meanwhile, Texas’ "open carry" and "campus carry" laws have unsettled some communities, with businesses banning guns and cities advising residents not to overreact to lawful carriers. California’s new protective-order law, designed to prevent mass shootings by allowing police or family members to act on threats or disturbing behavior, is seen as a significant win for gun-control advocates, though critics worry it may infringe on constitutional rights. Both sides are intensifying their efforts: gun-control advocates are restricting access in blue and purple states, while the NRA pushes to arm more public spaces. Despite defeats in some states, gun-control groups have successfully stopped NRA-backed campus-carry laws in 14 of 16 states where they were proposed. END OF SUMMARY.
