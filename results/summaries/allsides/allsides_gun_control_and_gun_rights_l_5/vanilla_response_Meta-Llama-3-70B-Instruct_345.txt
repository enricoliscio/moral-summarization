SUMMARY:

Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the political environment, despite the NRA's continued influence. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, an additional half-dozen states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18 nationwide. While the number of new state gun-control laws in 2015 was less than in 2013, advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, which passed laws allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit. However, gun-control advocates won a significant victory in California with a protective-order law, which allows police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Both sides are pulling harder in the state-level battle over gun laws, with gun-control advocates stepping up efforts to restrict access in blue and purple states.

END OF SUMMARY.
