SUMMARY:
Gun control advocates and the NRA have been battling it out at the state level, with both sides claiming victories and defeats in the fight to shape gun legislation. Despite the moral framing of the issue, with gun control advocates pushing for stricter laws to prevent massacres and the NRA arguing for more guns in more places, the fight has resulted in a draw. While gun control advocates have gained momentum since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, with an additional six states enacting background check laws, the NRA has also had victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without a permit. Gun control advocates boast about stopping campus-carry laws, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. The California protective-order law, passed in response to the Isla Vista shooting, is a promising model for other states to follow, say gun control advocates, as it allows action to be taken if someone displays disturbing behavior. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with both sides pulling harder than ever before.
END OF SUMMARY.
