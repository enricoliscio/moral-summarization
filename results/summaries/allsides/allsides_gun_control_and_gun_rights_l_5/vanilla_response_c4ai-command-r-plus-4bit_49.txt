SUMMARY: The debate over gun control in the United States has seen victories for both advocates of stricter gun control measures and supporters of expanded gun rights. While the NRA has achieved successes in Kansas, Maine, and Texas, allowing for more permissive concealed carry and open carry laws, gun control advocates have also made gains. An additional six states have enacted background check laws since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, bringing the total to 18. Gun control advocates have also successfully blocked NRA-backed campus carry laws in 14 states and celebrated the passage of a protective order law in California, which allows for the removal of firearms from individuals displaying threatening behavior. Despite these achievements, the battle over gun laws remains fiercely contested, with both sides intensifying their efforts at the state level. Gun rights supporters argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings, while gun control advocates continue to push for restricting access in blue and purple states. The political environment has shifted, with gun control gaining momentum since Sandy Hook, but the NRA remains a powerful force in the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
