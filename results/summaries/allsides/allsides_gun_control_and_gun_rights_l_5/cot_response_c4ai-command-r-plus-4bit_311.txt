SUMMARY:
Gun control advocates have claimed *momentum* in their battle for stricter gun laws in the US, despite recent *defeats* and *victories* for the NRA. While the NRA celebrated wins in Kansas, Maine, and Texas for laws allowing more permissive concealed carry and open carry, advocates for gun control have successfully blocked NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states. They also achieved a big win in California with a protective-order law that allows police and family members to intervene if someone displays *disturbing* behavior. This law addresses concerns about *infringement* on constitutional rights by allowing action even without an arrest or involuntary commitment. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with gun control advocates pushing for more restrictions in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. Despite the ongoing debate, both sides are pulling harder, and the issue of gun control is no longer seen as a *worrying* political third rail.
END OF SUMMARY.
