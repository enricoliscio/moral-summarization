Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the ongoing battle between gun control advocates and the NRA, highlighting recent developments in state laws.

I notice the author uses several morally charged words like "massacre," "fighting," "expand," "protecting," and others. I should make sure to include these in the summary to maintain the moral tone. The key points are the progress made by gun control groups despite federal setbacks, the NRA's victories in some states, and the ongoing efforts on both sides.

I'll start by mentioning the deadlock between the two sides. Then, I'll highlight the momentum gun control advocates gained after Sandy Hook, the new state laws, and their successes in blocking NRA-backed measures. On the other side, I'll note the NRA's victories in Kansas and Maine, and the debate over arming more places versus stricter laws.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main achievements and conflicts. I'll ensure to use the morally framed words to reflect the author's perspective. Finally, I'll structure the summary to show the balanced yet intense nature of the gun control debate.

SUMMARY: The battle over gun control in the U.S. remains a moral and political deadlock, with both sides making strides. Gun-control advocates, gaining momentum since the Sandy Hook massacre, have enacted background check laws in 18 states, while fighting NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights. They've successfully protected legislators targeted by the NRA and stopped campus-carry laws in 14 states. Meanwhile, the NRA has won in Kansas and Maine, where new laws allow concealed carry without permits. Open carry laws in Texas have unsettled some, prompting businesses to ban guns and cities to advise against overreporting lawful carriers. A California law allowing police or family to act on threats or disturbing behavior, inspired by the Isla Vista rampage, is seen as a promising model for other states. Despite progress, gun-control advocates face challenges, with the NRA arguing that arming more people could prevent mass shootings. The debate remains intense, with both sides pulling harder in this moral tug of war. END OF SUMMARY.
