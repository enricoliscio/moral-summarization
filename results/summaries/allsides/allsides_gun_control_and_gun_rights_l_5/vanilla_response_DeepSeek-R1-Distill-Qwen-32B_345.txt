Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article talks about the current state of gun control in the US, focusing on recent developments and the ongoing debate between gun control advocates and the NRA.

Starting from the beginning, Tim Daly from the Center for American Progress says it's a draw, meaning both sides have made progress. Since Sandy Hook, gun control advocates have gained momentum. Even though federal efforts failed, 18 states now have background check laws. In 2015, fewer new laws were passed than in 2013, but advocates have been more effective in fighting NRA-backed measures. Shannon Watts feels they're making progress, and it's no longer a third rail issue.

On the other side, the NRA won in Kansas and Maine with laws allowing concealed carry without permits. Gun rights supporters are happy with Texas's open carry and campus carry laws, but some businesses are banning guns, and Dallas is advising people not to call 911 for holstered guns. The California law allowing protective orders is a big win for gun control, targeting those showing concerning behavior without criminal charges.

Overall, the battle is more balanced now, with both sides intensifying their efforts. Gun control groups, backed by Bloomberg, have stopped NRA bills in 14 states. It's a tug of war with both sides pulling hard.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the balanced progress, the states with background checks, the NRA's state victories, the Texas laws, business reactions, the California law, and the ongoing struggle between both sides. Also, note the funding from Bloomberg and the successes in stopping NRA bills.

Let me structure this: start with the overall situation, mention the 18 states with background checks, the NRA's state wins, the Texas laws and reactions, the California law, and conclude with the ongoing battle and successes in stopping NRA initiatives.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit. Let me check the word count as I write to stay within 200 words.
