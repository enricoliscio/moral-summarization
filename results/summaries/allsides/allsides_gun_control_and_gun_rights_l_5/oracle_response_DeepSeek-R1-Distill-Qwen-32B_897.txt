Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure those words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the gun control debate in the US, with both sides making progress. The author uses words like "massacre," "fighting," "expand," etc., which are important to include.

I should start by identifying the key events: Sandy Hook massacre, states enacting background checks, NRA's victories in Kansas and Maine, new laws in Texas, and California's protective-order law. Also, mention the efforts of gun control advocates and their successes in stopping NRA-backed bills.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it flows well. I'll structure it by mentioning the overall situation, the progress on both sides, specific examples, and conclude with the ongoing battle.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the morally framed words and keep it concise. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The gun control debate in the U.S. remains a contentious battle, with both sides making strides. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, gun-control advocates have gained momentum, enacting background check laws in 18 states and improving their efforts to fight NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. Advocates like Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action feel the "wind is at their backs," as the issue is no longer politically toxic. Meanwhile, the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, where new laws allow concealed carry without permits. Gun-rights supporters have also cheered "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in Texas, though these have unsettled some communities. California passed a protective-order law, seen as a model for other states, allowing police or family members to act if someone makes threats or displays disturbing behavior, even without committing a crime. Despite these wins, gun-control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, have successfully stopped NRA-backed campus-carry laws in 14 of 16 states. The battle over gun laws remains a tug of war, with both sides pulling harder, as the debate over how to prevent shootings and restrict access continues. END OF SUMMARY.
