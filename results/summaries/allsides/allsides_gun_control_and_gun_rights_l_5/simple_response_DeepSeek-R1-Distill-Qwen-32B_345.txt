Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the ongoing debate between gun control advocates and the NRA. Since Sandy Hook, there's been progress in some states with background checks, but the NRA has also made gains, like in Kansas and Maine. The article mentions specific laws and their implications, like the California protective-order law and the open carry laws.

I need to highlight the moral framing, so I should note how each side presents their arguments as just or necessary. Gun control advocates argue for preventing violence and protecting vulnerable people, while the NRA supports arming more people for safety.

I should structure the summary to show the back-and-forth between the two sides, emphasizing the moral justifications each uses. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the essence of both perspectives.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's balanced and reflects the moral dimensions each side presents. I'll avoid taking a side but present the arguments as they are framed in the article.

SUMMARY: The debate over gun control in the U.S. remains deeply polarized, with both sides making strides in recent years. Gun-control advocates, gaining momentum since the Sandy Hook tragedy, have pushed for stricter laws, such as background checks and a California protective-order law designed to prevent violence by allowing authorities to act on threats or disturbing behavior. These advocates argue their efforts are ethical and necessary to protect vulnerable populations. Meanwhile, the NRA and its allies have successfully pushed "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in states like Texas, Kansas, and Maine, framing these as a responsible means of self-defense. Despite setbacks in some states, both sides are intensifying their efforts, with gun-control groups, backed by funding from figures like Michael Bloomberg, claiming success in blocking NRA-backed legislation in 14 states. The moral framing of the debate centers on competing values: advocates emphasize preventing harm and protecting constitutional rights, while gun-rights supporters argue for self-defense and freedom. The conflict remains a tug-of-war, with neither side willing to relent. END OF SUMMARY.
