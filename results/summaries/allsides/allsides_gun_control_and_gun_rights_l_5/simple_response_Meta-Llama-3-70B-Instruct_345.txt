SUMMARY:

In the ongoing battle over gun control, advocates for stricter laws are claiming momentum despite the NRA's continued influence. Since the Sandy Hook massacre, 18 states have enacted background check laws, and advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. While the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, gun-control advocates have won significant battles, including the passage of California's protective-order law, which allows police or family members to take action against individuals who make threats or display disturbing behavior. This law is seen as a promising model for other states to follow. Despite setbacks, both sides are intensifying their efforts, with gun-control advocates working to restrict access in blue and purple states, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people in more places is the key to preventing mass shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
