SUMMARY: The debate over gun control in the United States has seen mixed results in recent years, with advocates for stricter laws claiming momentum following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. While there has been a failed push for federal background check legislation, several states have enacted their own background check laws, and advocates have successfully blocked NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without a permit, and "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in Texas. A significant win for gun-control advocates was the passage of a protective-order law in California, allowing police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with gun-control advocates pushing for restrictions in blue and purple states, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. Despite some setbacks, gun-control advocates have successfully blocked campus-carry laws in 14 states. The issue of gun control continues to be a highly contentious and polarizing topic in American politics.
