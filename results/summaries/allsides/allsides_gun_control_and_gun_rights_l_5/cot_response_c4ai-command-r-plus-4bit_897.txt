SUMMARY:
Gun control advocates and the NRA are locked in a tight battle over state-level gun laws, with both sides claiming victories and defeats. While the NRA scored wins in Kansas and Maine by passing laws allowing concealed carry without a permit, gun control advocates celebrated the enactment of background check laws in an additional six states. They also successfully blocked NRA-backed campus carry laws in 14 states. Despite the mixed results, advocates for stricter gun control feel they have the "wind at their backs" as they continue to make progress in challenging the NRA's dominance in the political arena. A significant victory for gun control advocates was the passage of a protective order law in California, which allows police or family members to take action if someone displays disturbing behavior that falls short of a crime. This law is seen as a promising model for other states. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with gun control advocates pushing for more restrictions in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. The NRA's efforts to expand gun rights have been met with resistance, and the gun control movement has gained momentum since the Sandy Hook tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
