SUMMARY:
Gun control advocates and the NRA have been locked in a fierce battle over state-level gun laws, with both sides claiming victories and defeats. While advocates for stricter gun control have made gains in some states, such as the expansion of background check laws and the defeat of NRA-backed campus-carry laws, the NRA has also scored wins in Kansas and Maine, which passed laws allowing permitless concealed carry. The fight over gun laws has become more intense and evenly matched in recent years, with gun control advocates working to restrict access in blue and purple states, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. Despite setbacks, gun control advocates remain optimistic, citing their improved record in fighting NRA-backed expansions and protecting legislators in elections. A significant victory for gun control advocates was the passage of a protective-order law in California, which allows police and family members to take action if someone displays disturbing behavior that falls short of a crime. The law is seen as a promising model for other states. The battle over gun laws continues to rage, with both sides pulling harder than ever.
END OF SUMMARY.
