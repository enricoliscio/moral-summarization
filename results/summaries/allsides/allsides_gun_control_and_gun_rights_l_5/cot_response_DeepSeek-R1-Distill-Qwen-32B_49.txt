Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about the gun control debate. Terms like "massacre," "stricter gun control," "momentum," "failed push," "background check laws," "improved their record," "wind at our backs," "third rail," "victories," "cheered," "unsettled," "banning guns," "video," "discouraging," "infringe on constitutional rights," "promising model," "defeats," "sail through," and "stepped up efforts" stand out as morally framed words.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using these terms. The summary should reflect the balance between gun control advocates making progress and the NRA's influence. I should mention the states that passed laws, the NRA's victories, and the ongoing efforts on both sides. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing.

I should structure the summary to show the progress on one side and the pushback on the other. Maybe start with the overall assessment as a draw, then mention the states that enacted laws, the NRA's successes, and the ongoing battles. I'll also touch on specific examples like California's protective order and the NRA's campus carry laws.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the key points and the moral language. Let me put it all together now.

**Moral Framing Summary:**

The article presents a nuanced view of the gun control debate, highlighting both progress and setbacks. Advocates for stricter gun control have gained momentum since the Sandy Hook tragedy, with 18 states enacting background check laws. However, the NRA has achieved victories, such as "open carry" laws in Texas, which have unsettled some communities. The NRA's influence is evident in states like Kansas and Maine, where concealed carry without permits was legalized. Despite these challenges, gun control groups, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, have successfully blocked NRA-backed campus carry laws in 14 states. California's new protective-order law, aimed at preventing mass shootings, is seen as a promising model, though it faced criticism for potentially infringing on rights. The battle over gun laws remains a contentious tug of war, with both sides intensifying their efforts, reflecting a stalemate in the broader debate.
