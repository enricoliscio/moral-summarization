SUMMARY: The debate over gun control in the United States has seen mixed results in recent years, with advocates for stricter gun control gaining momentum following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. While a push for federal background check legislation failed, several states have enacted their own background check laws, and advocates have successfully blocked NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA has achieved victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without a permit, and "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in Texas. Gun-control advocates have also scored wins, such as a protective-order law in California that allows police or family members to take action if an individual displays threatening behavior. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with both sides pushing for their agendas in state legislatures. Gun-control advocates have focused on restricting access in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people in more places is the solution to mass shootings. Despite setbacks, gun-control supporters have successfully blocked campus-carry laws in 14 states. The political landscape on gun control is evolving, with advocates claiming momentum and a more balanced debate.
