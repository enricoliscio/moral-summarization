Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the current state of gun control and NRA influence in the US. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts by mentioning Tim Daly from the Center for American Progress, saying it's a draw in the gun control debate. Since the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, gun control advocates have gained momentum. They've managed to pass background check laws in 18 states, despite federal level failures. In 2015, fewer laws were passed than in 2013, but they've been more successful in fighting NRA-backed expansions.

Shannon Watts from Moms Demand Action feels they're making progress, saying it's no longer a third rail. The NRA won in Kansas and Maine with concealed carry laws without permits. Texas has new open carry laws, which some businesses are opposing by banning guns, while Dallas is advising residents not to overreact to seeing holstered guns.

California passed a protective-order law allowing police or family to take action if someone is threatening or acting disturbantly, even without criminal charges. This was in response to the UC-Santa Barbara shooting. NRA and their allies argue that arming more people is the solution, like in schools and campuses. Despite losing in some states, gun control groups, supported by Bloomberg, stopped NRA-backed campus carry laws in 14 out of 16 states.

So, the main points are:

- Post-Sandy Hook, gun control advocates have made strides at the state level, despite federal setbacks.
- NRA has successes in some states with concealed and open carry laws.
- California's new law as a model for others.
- Both sides are intensifying their efforts, with gun control groups successfully blocking NRA initiatives in many states.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include both sides and key developments. I'll structure it by mentioning the overall stalemate, the progress made by gun control advocates, NRA's victories, the California law, and the ongoing efforts on both sides.

SUMMARY: The gun control debate in the U.S. remains a stalemate, with both sides making gains. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook tragedy, gun control advocates have advanced at the state level, enacting background checks in 18 states and successfully countering NRA-backed measures. Groups like Moms Demand Action feel momentum, with California passing a protective-order law targeting threatening behavior. Meanwhile, the NRA secured wins in Kansas and Maine, promoting concealed carry without permits, and Texas embraced open carry, prompting mixed responses. Despite NRA efforts, gun control advocates, backed by Bloomberg, blocked campus-carry laws in 14 states. The battle continues, with both sides intensifying their efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
