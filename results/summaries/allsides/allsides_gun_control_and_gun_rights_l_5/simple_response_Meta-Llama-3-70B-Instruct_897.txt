SUMMARY:

Advocates for stricter gun control are claiming momentum in the battle over gun laws, despite the NRA's continued influence. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, 18 states have enacted background check laws, and gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA has had some victories, such as laws allowing concealed carry without a permit in Kansas and Maine, but gun-control advocates have made significant gains. A new California law, designed in response to the 2014 Isla Vista shooting, allows police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Gun-control advocates see this as a promising model for other states to follow. The moral framing of this issue is clear: stricter gun control is necessary to prevent mass shootings and protect human life, while the NRA's efforts to arm more people in more places are misguided and dangerous.

END OF SUMMARY.
