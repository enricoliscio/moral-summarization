SUMMARY:

Despite the National Rifle Association's (NRA) historical dominance, advocates for stricter gun control have claimed momentum since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. In recent years, the battle over gun laws has become a more evenly matched tug of war. While the NRA has achieved victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, gun-control advocates have fought back, protecting legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. Advocates have also restricted access to guns in blue and purple states, stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 of 16 states where bills were introduced. A significant win for gun-control advocates is the California protective-order law, which allows police or worried family members to take action against individuals who make threats or display disturbing behavior, preventing potential mass shootings. Overall, the momentum has shifted, with gun-control advocates feeling they have the wind at their backs for the first time ever.

END OF SUMMARY.
