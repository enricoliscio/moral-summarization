Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article's content.

The article discusses the ongoing battle between gun control advocates and the NRA. It mentions the Sandy Hook massacre, which is a strong moral word indicating a tragic event. Since then, gun control groups have gained momentum, even though federal efforts failed. States have enacted background checks, which is a positive step for control advocates.

The NRA has made gains in states like Kansas and Maine with concealed carry laws. Gun-rights supporters are happy, but some businesses are banning guns, and Dallas is advising people not to call 911 unnecessarily. This shows a divide and the impact on public spaces.

California's protective-order law is a big win for control advocates, allowing police to act on threats without arrest. It's a response to the Isla Vista shooting, highlighting the need to prevent such rampages. The NRA and their allies argue that arming more people is the solution, but gun control groups have successfully stopped many campus-carry laws, showing their strength.

I need to include the morally charged words like massacre, fighting, expand, protecting, targeted, violation, acting, threats, rampage, infringe, restrict, shootings, stopping, and enact. I should structure the summary to show the balance of power between the two sides, emphasizing the moral implications of each action.

I'll start by mentioning the Sandy Hook massacre and the momentum it gave to gun control. Then, note the state-level successes and NRA's victories. Highlight the California law and the opposing arguments. Conclude with the ongoing tug of war and the efforts to restrict access versus arming more people.

Make sure to keep the summary under 200 words and include all the key moral terms without making it too verbose. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise, reflecting the moral framing accurately.

SUMMARY: The battle over gun laws in the U.S. remains a moral and political tug of war, with both sides making strides. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, gun-control advocates have gained momentum, enacting background check laws in 18 states and successfully fighting NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights. Advocates like Shannon Watts feel they now have the "wind at their backs," with California's new protective-order law—a major victory—allowing police or family members to act on threats or disturbing behavior. Meanwhile, the NRA has pushed for "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in states like Texas, Kansas, and Maine, though some businesses and cities are resisting these changes. Despite these developments, gun-control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, have stopped NRA-backed campus-carry bills in 14 out of 16 states. The debate over how to prevent shootings—whether by restricting access or arming more people—continues to divide the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
