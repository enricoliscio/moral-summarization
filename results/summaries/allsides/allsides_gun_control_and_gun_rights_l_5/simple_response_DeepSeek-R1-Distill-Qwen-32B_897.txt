Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the gun control debate in the US. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the original text talks about the balance between gun control advocates and the NRA, so I should highlight that tension.

First, I'll read through the article again to get the main points. It mentions that since Sandy Hook, gun control groups have gained momentum, even though federal efforts failed. They've managed to pass background checks in 18 states. The NRA has won in Kansas and Maine with concealed carry laws, and Texas has open carry laws which are causing some pushback from businesses and local governments.

On the other side, California passed a protective order law allowing police or family to take action if someone is threatening, which was a response to the Isla Vista shooting. The NRA argues that more arming is the solution, but gun control groups have been successful in stopping campus carry laws in 14 states.

I need to make sure the summary captures both sides' moral arguments. Gun control advocates see progress and momentum, while the NRA is promoting more access. I should keep the language neutral but reflect the moral stances each side takes, like the NRA's emphasis on arming more people versus the advocates' focus on preventing violence through restrictions.

Also, the user specified to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and keep it under 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the balance, then the successes of each side, and conclude with the ongoing struggle. That should cover the key points and maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The U.S. gun control debate remains a contentious tug of war, with both sides making strides in recent years. Since the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, gun control advocates have gained momentum, enacting background check laws in 18 states and successfully countering NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights. Groups like Moms Demand Action and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence highlight their progress, including Californiaâ€™s new protective-order law, which allows police or family members to act when individuals display threatening behavior, even without committing a crime. Meanwhile, the NRA has pushed for more permissive gun laws, such as open-carry and campus-carry measures in Texas, Kansas, and Maine, despite public unease and resistance from businesses and local governments. While gun control advocates boast of blocking NRA-backed legislation in 14 states, the NRA continues to argue that arming more people is the key to preventing mass shootings. The battle over gun laws remains evenly matched, with both sides intensifying their efforts in state legislatures. END OF SUMMARY.
