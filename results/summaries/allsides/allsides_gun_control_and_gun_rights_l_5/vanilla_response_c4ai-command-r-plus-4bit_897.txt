SUMMARY: Despite setbacks at the federal level and victories for the National Rifle Association (NRA) in some states, advocates for stricter gun control measures have made gains at the state level in recent years. Since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, an additional six states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18. Gun control advocates have also successfully blocked NRA-backed campus-carry laws in 14 states. While the NRA has celebrated new "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in Texas, local businesses and governments have had to address concerns from citizens unsettled by the more visible presence of guns in public spaces. In California, a new protective-order law allows police or family members to take action if an individual makes threats or displays disturbing behavior, even if it does not warrant arrest or involuntary commitment. Overall, the battle over gun laws at the state level has intensified, with both sides pushing harder for their respective agendas. Gun control advocates are optimistic about their momentum, while the NRA and its allies continue to argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. 

END OF SUMMARY.
