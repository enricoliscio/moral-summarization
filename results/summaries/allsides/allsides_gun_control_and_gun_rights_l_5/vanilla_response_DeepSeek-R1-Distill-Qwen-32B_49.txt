Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the current state of gun control in the US. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about Tim Daly from the Center for American Progress, saying it's a draw in the gun control debate. Since Sandy Hook, gun control advocates have been gaining momentum, even though federal efforts failed. Some states have passed background check laws, bringing the total to 18. In 2015, fewer new laws were passed than in 2013, but advocates have been more successful in fighting NRA-backed expansions.

Shannon Watts from Moms Demand Action feels the wind is at their backs, meaning things are looking better for their cause. The NRA had big wins in Kansas and Maine with laws allowing concealed carry without permits. Texas has new open carry and campus carry laws, which have caused some public reaction, with businesses banning guns and cities advising when to call the police.

California's new protective-order law is a big win for gun control, allowing police or family to act if someone is threatening or behaving dangerously, even if they haven't committed a crime yet. This was in response to the Isla Vista shooting. NRA and their allies argue that arming more people is the way to prevent mass shootings, pushing for more guns in schools and campuses. Despite losing in some states, gun control groups, backed by Bloomberg, have stopped NRA efforts in 14 out of 16 states where campus-carry bills were introduced.

So, the summary needs to capture the back-and-forth between gun control and NRA-backed laws, the states involved, key laws passed, and the overall momentum. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the main points without getting too detailed.

I'll structure it by mentioning the ongoing debate, the states where each side has won, key laws like background checks, concealed carry, and California's protective order. Also, note the strategies each side is using and the overall stalemate but increased activity.

Let me make sure I include all the important elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with the overall situation, then mention the states and specific laws, and end with the strategies and the stalemate.

SUMMARY: The U.S. gun control debate remains a stalemate, with both sides making gains. Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, gun control advocates have seen 18 states enact background check laws, despite federal failures. The NRA won in Kansas and Maine with concealed carry laws, while Texas saw "open carry" and "campus carry" laws, prompting public reactions like business gun bans and city advisories. California's protective-order law, a major win for gun control, allows action against threatening individuals, inspired by the Isla Vista shooting. The NRA pushes for more armed places, like schools, while gun control groups, backed by Bloomberg, have blocked NRA efforts in 14 states. The battle remains evenly matched, with both sides intensifying their efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
