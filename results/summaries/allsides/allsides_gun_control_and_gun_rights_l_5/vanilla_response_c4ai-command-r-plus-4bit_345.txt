SUMMARY: While the NRA has historically dominated the political environment on gun control, advocates for stricter gun control have gained momentum since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. Despite a failed push for universal background checks at the federal level, several states have enacted such laws, and advocates have successfully blocked NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without permits, and Texas passed "open carry" and "campus carry" laws. Gun-control advocates celebrated the passage of a protective-order law in California, allowing police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. The battle over gun laws at the state level has intensified, with both sides actively pushing for their agendas. Gun-control advocates have focused on restricting access in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people in more places is the solution to mass shootings. Advocates for stricter gun control feel they have gained ground, despite some defeats, by blocking campus-carry laws in several states.
END OF SUMMARY.
