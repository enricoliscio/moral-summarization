SUMMARY: The debate over gun control in the United States has seen recent victories for both advocates of stricter gun control measures and supporters of expanded gun rights. While the NRA has successfully pushed for more permissive laws in Kansas, Maine, and Texas, gun control advocates have made significant progress at the state level, with an additional six states enacting background check laws since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. The California protective-order law, which allows police or family members to take action if an individual displays threatening behavior, is hailed as a major victory for gun control advocates. Despite setbacks in some states, opponents of expanded gun rights have successfully blocked campus-carry laws in 14 out of 16 states where bills were introduced, demonstrating a shift in the political landscape surrounding gun control. Both sides of the debate are intensifying their efforts, with gun control advocates working to restrict access in blue and purple states, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. The fight over gun laws in America remains a highly contentious issue, with both sides claiming momentum and victories.
