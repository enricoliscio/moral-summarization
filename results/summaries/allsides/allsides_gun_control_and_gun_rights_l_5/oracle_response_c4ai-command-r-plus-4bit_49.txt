SUMMARY: While the NRA has historically dominated the political environment and fought against gun control, advocates for stricter gun control have gained momentum since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. Despite a failed push for federal background check laws, 18 states have now enacted such laws, and gun control advocates have successfully stopped NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights in other states. The NRA scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without a permit, and Texas has passed "open carry" and "campus carry" laws, but gun control advocates are pushing back, with businesses and governments taking action to protect citizens from the potential dangers of openly displayed firearms. The California protective-order law is a significant win for gun control, allowing action to be taken if someone makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Both sides are pulling harder in the state-level battle, with gun control advocates restricting access in blue and purple states, and the NRA arguing for arming more people in more places. Gun control advocates have also stopped campus-carry laws in 14 out of 16 states, a significant shift from the past. The battle over gun laws in the US continues to be a highly contentious and morally charged issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
