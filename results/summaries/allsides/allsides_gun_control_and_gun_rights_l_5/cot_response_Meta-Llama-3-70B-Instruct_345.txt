SUMMARY:
In the ongoing battle over gun laws, advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. Despite failed pushes at the federal level, 18 states have enacted background check laws. Gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protecting legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, which passed laws allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit. However, gun-control advocates boast about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states. The California protective-order law, designed in response to the 2014 Isla Vista shooting, is a promising model for other states to follow. Both sides are pulling harder, with gun-control advocates arguing that restricting access is key to preventing mass shootings, while the NRA argues that arming more people is the solution.
