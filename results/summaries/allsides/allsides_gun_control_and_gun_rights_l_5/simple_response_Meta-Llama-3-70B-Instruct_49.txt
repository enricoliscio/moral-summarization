SUMMARY:

Advocates for stricter gun control have claimed momentum since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, with 18 states now having background check laws. Despite failed federal efforts, gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protecting legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit. However, gun-control advocates won a significant victory in California with a protective-order law, allowing police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. This law is seen as a promising model for other states to follow. The battle over gun laws has become more evenly matched, with both sides pulling harder. Gun-control advocates have stepped up efforts to restrict access, while the NRA argues that arming more people is the key to preventing mass shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
