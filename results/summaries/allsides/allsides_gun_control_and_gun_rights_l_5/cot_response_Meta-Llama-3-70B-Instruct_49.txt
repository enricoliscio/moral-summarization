SUMMARY:
Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the battle over gun laws, despite the NRA's continued influence. Since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, eight additional states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18 nationwide. While the NRA has had victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The California protective-order law, designed in response to the 2014 shooting rampage by Eliot Rodger, is seen as a promising model for other states to follow. As the battle over gun laws intensifies, both sides are pulling harder, with gun-control advocates boasting about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states. END OF SUMMARY.
