SUMMARY:
Gun control advocates and the NRA have been battling it out at the state level, with both sides claiming victories and defeats. While the NRA scored wins in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without a permit, gun control advocates cheered new "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in Texas while also securing a protective-order law in California. This law allows police or family members to intervene if someone makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Advocates for stricter gun control have gained momentum since the Sandy Hook tragedy, with an additional six states enacting background check laws. They have also improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protecting their legislators in elections. Despite their defeats in some states, gun control advocates backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg boast of stopping campus-carry laws in 14 states. The battle over gun laws has become a tug of war, with both sides pulling harder. Gun control advocates push for restricting access, while the NRA argues arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. The moral framing of this article centers around the rights and protection of citizens, with gun control advocates and the NRA both claiming to have citizens' best interests at heart.
