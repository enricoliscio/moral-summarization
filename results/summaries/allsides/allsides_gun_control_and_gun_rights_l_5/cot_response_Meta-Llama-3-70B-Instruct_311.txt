SUMMARY:
Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the battle over gun laws, despite the NRA's dominance in the political environment. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, 18 states have enacted background check laws, and gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, where laws allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit were passed. However, gun-control advocates boast about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states. A promising model for other states is the California protective-order law, which allows police or worried family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Both sides are pulling harder in the tug of war over gun laws, with gun-control advocates seeking to restrict access and the NRA arguing that arming more people is the key to preventing mass shootings.
