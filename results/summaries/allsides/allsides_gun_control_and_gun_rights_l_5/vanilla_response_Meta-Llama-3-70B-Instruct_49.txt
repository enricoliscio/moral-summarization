SUMMARY:

Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the political environment, despite the NRA's dominance. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, an additional six states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18 nationwide. While the number of new state gun-control laws in 2015 was less than in 2013, advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protecting legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, which passed laws allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit. California's protective-order law was a big win for gun-control advocates, allowing police or worried family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Both sides seem to be pulling harder in the state-level battle over gun laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
