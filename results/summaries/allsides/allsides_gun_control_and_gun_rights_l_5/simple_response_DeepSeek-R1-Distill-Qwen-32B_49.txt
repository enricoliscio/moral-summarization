Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article talks about the current state of gun control in the US, focusing on the balance between gun control advocates and the NRA.

So, Tim Daly from the Center for American Progress says it's a draw. Since Sandy Hook, gun control groups have gained momentum. They've managed to pass background check laws in 18 states, even though federal efforts failed. They've also been successful in blocking NRA-backed laws in many states. Shannon Watts feels they're making progress, which wasn't the case before.

On the other side, the NRA has won in Kansas and Maine with concealed carry laws. Texas has new open carry laws, which have led to some pushback from businesses and cities. The article also mentions California's protective-order law, which is a big win for gun control, aimed at preventing mass shootings by allowing intervention before someone commits a crime.

Both sides are intensifying their efforts. Gun control advocates are focusing on blue and purple states, while the NRA is pushing for more arming in public places. Despite some losses, gun control groups are proud of stopping NRA initiatives in 14 out of 16 states.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the stalemate, the progress made by both sides, and the moral implications each side presents. The moral framing is about safety, rights, and preventing violence. I should make sure to include key points like the number of states with background checks, the NRA's victories, the California law, and the overall tug of war between the two sides.

Let me structure it: Start with the stalemate, mention the progress on background checks, the NRA's wins, the California law, and the ongoing efforts on both sides. Keep it concise but cover all main points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The battle over gun control in the U.S. remains a stalemate, with both sides making gains. Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, gun-control advocates have advanced, enacting background checks in 18 states and successfully blocking NRA-backed laws in 14 states. Meanwhile, the NRA has won in Kansas and Maine, pushing concealed carry laws, while Texas embraced open carry, leading to public adjustments. California's new protective-order law, inspired by the Isla Vista shooting, allows intervention to prevent violence, seen as a model for others. Both sides intensify efforts, with gun-control groups focusing on restrictive measures and the NRA advocating for expanded gun access, including schools. The moral debate centers on balancing public safety with constitutional rights, reflecting a deeply divided nation. END OF SUMMARY.
