Alright, so the user has provided a query where they want a summary of a news article, preserving the moral framing. They've given specific instructions to use certain morally charged words and to keep the summary under 200 words. 

First, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about the ongoing debate over gun control in the US, highlighting the efforts of both gun control advocates and the NRA. The article mentions specific events, like the Sandy Hook massacre, and various state laws passed or defeated.

Next, I should identify the morally framed words the author used: massacre, fighting, expand, protecting, targeted, violation, acting, threats, rampage, infringe, restrict, shootings, stopping, enact. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary as much as possible.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the stalemate in gun control efforts, the momentum since Sandy Hook, state-level successes and failures, the NRA's influence, and the ongoing struggle between both sides. I'll need to weave in the moral terms naturally.

I should also ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the overall situation, then the advocates' progress, followed by the NRA's victories, and conclude with the ongoing battle and the impact of specific laws.

Finally, I'll check to make sure all the key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: The battle over gun control in the U.S. remains a stalemate, with both sides making gains and losses. Since the Sandy Hook massacre, gun-control advocates have gained momentum, enacting background check laws in 18 states and successfully fighting NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights. However, the NRA achieved victories in Kansas and Maine, where new laws allow concealed carry without permits. Meanwhile, "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in Texas have sparked concerns, with some businesses banning guns and cities advising residents not to overreact to lawful carriers. Gun-control advocates celebrated a major win in California with a protective-order law, designed to prevent violence by allowing police or family members to act on threats or disturbing behavior, even if no crime has been committed. Despite these successes, the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people in public spaces, like schools, is key to preventing mass shootings. Advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, have stopped NRA-backed campus-carry bills in 14 of 16 states. The fight over gun laws continues to intensify, with both sides pulling harder in this tug of war. END OF SUMMARY.
