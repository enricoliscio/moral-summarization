SUMMARY:
Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, with 18 states enacting background check laws. Despite failed pushes at the federal level, gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protecting legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, which has forced local businesses and governments to prepare citizens who may be unsettled to see guns openly displayed in public. However, gun-control advocates boast about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states, citing the California protective-order law as a promising model for other states to follow. END OF SUMMARY.
