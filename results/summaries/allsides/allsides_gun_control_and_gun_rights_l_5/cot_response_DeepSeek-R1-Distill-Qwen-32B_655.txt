Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what moral framing means here. It refers to words that carry a positive or negative connotation, indicating approval or disapproval.

Looking at the article, I should identify all the single words that are morally framed. Words like "momentum," "failed," "improved," "wind," "back," "third rail," "biggest," "cheered," "unsettled," "ban," "disadvantages," "expanded," "infringe," "promising," "model," "defeats," "boast," "sail through." These words carry moral weight, showing support or opposition to certain policies.

Next, I need to summarize the article using these words. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include as many of these moral terms as possible. The key points are the ongoing debate over gun control, the progress made by advocates despite setbacks, and the pushback from the NRA. I'll highlight the states where laws were passed, the successes and challenges faced by both sides, and the overall stalemate in the gun control debate.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the momentum gained by gun control advocates, then the NRA's victories, followed by the stalemate and future implications. This way, the moral framing is preserved, showing both sides' efforts and the complex situation they're in.

**SUMMARY:**  
The gun control debate in the U.S. remains a contentious and morally charged issue. Advocates for stricter gun laws have gained momentum since the Sandy Hook tragedy, with 18 states now enforcing background check laws. Despite federal failures, they have improved their record by countering NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights. Groups like Moms Demand Action feel the "wind is at their backs," signaling a shift away from gun control being a politically risky issue. However, the NRA has scored victories in states like Kansas and Maine, where "open carry" and "campus carry" laws have been passed, though these have unsettled some communities. Businesses are banning guns, and cities like Dallas are discouraging over-reactions to lawful carriers. A California law allowing police to act on threats or disturbing behavior, inspired by the Isla Vista shooting, is seen as a promising model for other states. Meanwhile, the NRA argues that arming more people could prevent mass shootings. Despite defeats in some states, gun-control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, boast of stopping NRA-backed campus-carry bills in 14 of 16 states. The battle over gun laws has become a stalemate, with both sides pulling harder in their respective directions. END OF SUMMARY.
