SUMMARY:

Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the political environment, despite the NRA's dominance. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, an additional half-dozen states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18 nationwide. While the number of new state gun-control laws in 2015 was less than in 2013, advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, which passed laws allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit. Gun-control advocates celebrated the California protective-order law, which allows police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Despite defeats in some states, gun-control advocates boast about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 of 16 states where bills were introduced.
