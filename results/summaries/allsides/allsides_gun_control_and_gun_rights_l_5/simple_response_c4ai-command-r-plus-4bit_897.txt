SUMMARY: While the NRA continues to exert influence over gun policy in the United States, advocates for stricter gun control have made significant progress in recent years, particularly at the state level. Despite setbacks at the federal level and in a few states, such as Kansas and Maine, the momentum has shifted towards those seeking to reduce gun violence. This is evidenced by the growing number of states enacting background check laws and the successful blocking of NRA-backed campus-carry laws. The passage of the California protective-order law, which allows for the removal of firearms from individuals exhibiting disturbing behavior or making threats, is a significant victory for gun-control advocates. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with both sides pushing harder for their respective agendas. Gun-control advocates have made headway by framing the issue as a moral imperative to protect innocent lives, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. The NRA's influence remains strong, but the tide may be turning as gun-control advocates gain traction and public support. END OF SUMMARY.
