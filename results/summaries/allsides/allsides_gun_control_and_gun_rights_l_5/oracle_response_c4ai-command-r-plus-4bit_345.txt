SUMMARY: Despite the failed push for stricter gun control laws at the federal level in the US, advocates have made progress at the state level. In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012, the momentum has shifted towards those seeking to restrict gun access. This is evidenced by the increasing number of states enacting background check laws and the successful blocking of NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights, such as "open carry" and "campus carry" laws. While the NRA has scored some victories in states like Kansas and Maine, gun control advocates have also achieved important wins, such as the passage of a protective-order law in California that allows for the removal of firearms from individuals displaying threatening or disturbing behavior. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with both sides pulling harder than ever. Gun control advocates have been fighting to restrict access in blue and purple states, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people in more places is the solution to mass shootings. The moral framing of the issue is clear, with advocates on both sides seeking to protect citizens from harm while navigating complex questions of rights, safety, and personal freedom.
END OF SUMMARY.
