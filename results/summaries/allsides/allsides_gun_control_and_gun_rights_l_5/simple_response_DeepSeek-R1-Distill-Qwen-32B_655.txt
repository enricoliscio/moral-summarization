Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user mentioned they want a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems to discuss the ongoing battle between gun control advocates and the NRA, highlighting recent developments in state laws. The article mentions that after the Sandy Hook tragedy, gun control groups gained momentum, even though federal efforts failed. They've managed to pass background check laws in 18 states, and they're successfully countering NRA-backed legislation. 

On the other side, the NRA has had some victories, like in Kansas and Maine, where they passed concealed carry laws without permits. There's also mention of Texas's open carry laws, which have led to some public reactions, like businesses banning guns and cities advising residents not to overreact. 

The article also talks about California's new protective-order law, which allows police or family to act if someone is threatening or behaving dangerously, even if they haven't committed a crime yet. This is seen as a positive step by gun control advocates. 

Both sides are intensifying their efforts, with gun control groups stopping NRA-backed campus carry laws in 14 out of 16 states. The overall tone seems to be that the battle is more evenly matched now, with both sides making gains but gun control advocates feeling optimistic.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I should mention the key points: the momentum of gun control after Sandy Hook, the state-level successes, the NRA's victories, the public reactions, California's law, and the intensifying efforts on both sides. I should make sure to highlight the moral framing, like the push for safety versus the rights perspective.

I'll start by stating the ongoing battle, then mention the successes of gun control advocates post-Sandy Hook, the states involved, the NRA's wins, the public responses, the California law, and the current stalemate with both sides making efforts. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary elements.

Let me draft this out, making sure each sentence covers a key point without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I'll make sure to end with the required tokens.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together into a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: The ongoing battle over gun control in the U.S. reflects a stalemate, with both sides making gains. Since the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, gun control advocates have gained momentum, enacting background check laws in 18 states and successfully countering NRA-backed legislation. However, the NRA has won in states like Kansas and Maine, where concealed carry without permits is now allowed. Texas's open carry laws have sparked mixed reactions, with some businesses banning guns and cities advising residents not to overreact to legal gun carriers. California passed a protective-order law, seen as a model for other states, allowing police or family to act on threats or concerning behavior. Despite NRA victories, gun control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, have blocked campus-carry laws in 14 out of 16 states. The battle remains evenly matched, with both sides intensifying efforts to restrict or expand gun rights. END OF SUMMARY.
