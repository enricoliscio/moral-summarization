SUMMARY:

Despite the NRA's dominance, advocates for stricter gun control have claimed momentum since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Eighteen states have enacted background check laws, and advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protecting legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, which passed laws allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, leading to concerns about violations of the law and reckless behavior. However, gun-control advocates scored a big win in California with a protective-order law, allowing police or family members to take action against individuals making threats or displaying disturbing behavior. Both sides are pulling harder, with gun-control advocates working to restrict access in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people is the key to preventing mass shootings. Despite defeats, gun-control advocates have stopped NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states.

END OF SUMMARY.
