Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about the current state of gun control in the US, focusing on the efforts of both gun control advocates and the NRA.

The article mentions that after the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, gun control advocates gained momentum. They've managed to pass background check laws in 18 states, though federal efforts have failed. They've also improved their record against NRA-backed laws. Shannon Watts from Moms Demand Action feels they're making progress.

On the other side, the NRA has won in Kansas and Maine with laws allowing concealed carry without permits. Texas has new open carry laws, which have caused some public reaction, like businesses banning guns and cities advising when to call the police.

California passed a protective-order law, the most expansive in the country, aimed at preventing mass shootings by allowing authorities to act when someone shows concerning behavior. This was in response to the Isla Vista shooting. The NRA and their allies argue that arming more places like schools is the solution.

The article ends by noting that while gun control groups, backed by Bloomberg, have stopped campus-carry laws in 14 states, the battle is ongoing and intense.

So, the summary should include the key points: the progress of gun control advocates, NRA victories, specific state laws (like California's), the debate over arming schools, and the ongoing struggle between both sides.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to capture all these elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The battle over gun control in the U.S. has seen significant developments, with both sides making strides. Gun control advocates, gaining momentum since the 2012 Sandy Hook tragedy, have successfully pushed background check laws in 18 states and improved their defense against NRA-backed initiatives. Groups like Moms Demand Action feel optimistic about their progress. Meanwhile, the NRA has won in states like Kansas and Maine, where concealed carry without permits is now allowed, and Texas has embraced open carry laws, prompting public reactions such as business bans and city advisories on when to call the police. California passed a landmark protective-order law, the most expansive in the nation, designed to prevent mass shootings by enabling authorities to intervene when individuals exhibit concerning behavior. The NRA and its allies argue that arming more public spaces, like schools, is key to preventing such tragedies. Despite these advancements, the debate remains intense, with gun control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, successfully blocking NRA-backed campus-carry laws in 14 states. The struggle continues as both sides intensify their efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
