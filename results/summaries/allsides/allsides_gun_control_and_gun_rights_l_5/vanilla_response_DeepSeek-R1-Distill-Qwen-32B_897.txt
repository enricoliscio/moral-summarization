Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the current state of gun control in the US. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Tim Daly from the Center for American Progress, saying it's a draw in the gun control debate. Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, there's been momentum for stricter laws. Even though federal efforts failed, 18 states now have background check laws. In 2015, fewer new laws were passed than in 2013, but advocates feel they're making progress against NRA-backed initiatives.

Shannon Watts from Moms Demand Action feels they have momentum now. The NRA has won in Kansas and Maine with concealed carry laws. Texas has new open carry laws, which some businesses are resisting by banning guns, while Dallas is advising residents not to overreact to holstered guns.

California passed a protective-order law allowing police or family to act if someone is threatening or acting suspiciously, even without a crime. This was in response to the Isla Vista shooting. The NRA and their allies argue that arming more people is the solution, but gun control groups, backed by Bloomberg, have successfully blocked campus-carry laws in 14 states.

So, the key points are: mixed progress in gun control, states passing various laws, both sides gaining ground, and the debate being more evenly contested now.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the main developments and the balance between gun control and NRA efforts.

SUMMARY: The gun control debate in the U.S. remains a closely contested issue, with both sides making gains. Since the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, advocates for stricter gun laws have seen progress, with 18 states enacting background check laws. While federal efforts have stalled, states like California have passed innovative measures, such as a law allowing police or family members to take action against individuals showing concerning behavior. Meanwhile, the NRA has scored victories in states like Kansas and Maine, where concealed carry without permits is now allowed. Texas has also seen new open-carry laws, though some businesses and cities are pushing back. Despite these developments, gun-control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, have successfully blocked NRA-backed campus-carry laws in 14 out of 16 states. The battle over gun laws has become more evenly matched, with both sides intensifying their efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
