SUMMARY:

Despite the NRA's continued influence, advocates for stricter gun control are claiming momentum in the battle over gun laws. Since the Sandy Hook massacre, 18 states have enacted background check laws, and gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. While the NRA has had some victories, such as laws allowing concealed carry without a permit in Kansas and Maine, gun-control advocates have made significant gains. The California protective-order law, which allows police or family members to take action against individuals who make threats or display disturbing behavior, is seen as a promising model for other states to follow. Gun-control advocates are also boasting about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states. As the debate continues, both sides are pulling harder, with gun-control advocates pushing for stricter laws and the NRA arguing that arming more people is the key to preventing mass shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
