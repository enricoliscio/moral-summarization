Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about the ongoing debate over gun control in the U.S. It mentions that since the Sandy Hook shooting, gun control advocates have gained momentum, even though federal efforts have failed. Some states have passed background check laws, and advocates are successfully fighting against NRA-backed laws. They feel optimistic, saying they have the "wind at their backs."

On the other side, the NRA has won in Kansas and Maine with laws allowing concealed carry without permits. Gun-rights supporters are happy about "open carry" and "campus carry" in Texas, but this has caused some public reaction, like businesses banning guns and cities advising when to call the police.

California passed a protective-order law, which is a big win for gun control. It allows police or family to take action if someone is threatening or behaving dangerously, even without criminal charges. This was in response to the UC-Santa Barbara shooting. Some worry it infringes on rights, but advocates see it as a model for others.

The article ends by saying both sides are intensifying their efforts. Gun-control groups, backed by Bloomberg, have stopped NRA bills in 14 states, feeling hopeful despite some losses.

So, the moral framing is about the struggle between gun control and gun rights, highlighting both sides' successes and challenges. The summary should capture this balance, emphasizing the progress on both fronts while noting the ongoing conflict.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points: the momentum of gun control advocates post-Sandy Hook, state-level successes, the NRA's wins, the California law, and the ongoing tug-of-war.

I should structure it to show both sides' achievements and the moral implications, like protecting public safety versus constitutional rights. Keeping it balanced but highlighting the moral stakes each side represents.

SUMMARY: The debate over gun control in the U.S. remains a contentious and morally charged issue, with both sides making strides in recent years. Since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, gun-control advocates have gained momentum, enacting background check laws in 18 states and successfully countering NRA-backed efforts to expand gun rights. Advocates like Shannon Watts feel optimistic, noting the issue is no longer politically toxic. Meanwhile, the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, where concealed carry without permits is now allowed. Gun-rights supporters have also celebrated "open carry" and "campus carry" laws in Texas, though these have sparked public unease, leading some businesses to ban guns and cities to issue guidelines on when to report gun sightings. California passed a landmark protective-order law, enabling police or family members to intervene when individuals exhibit threatening behavior, even without criminal charges. This law, inspired by the Isla Vista shooting, has been praised by gun-control advocates but criticized for potentially infringing on constitutional rights. As the state-level battle intensifies, both sides are escalating their efforts, with gun-control groups, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, successfully blocking NRA-backed campus-carry bills in 14 states. The moral framing highlights the tension between protecting public safety and upholding Second Amendment rights, with both sides claiming progress in this ongoing tug-of-war. END OF SUMMARY.
