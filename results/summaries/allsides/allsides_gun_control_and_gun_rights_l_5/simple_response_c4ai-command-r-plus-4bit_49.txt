SUMMARY: Despite setbacks at the federal level and in some states, advocates for stricter gun control measures in the United States are claiming momentum in their battle against the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). While the NRA scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without permits, gun control advocates have successfully blocked campus carry laws in 14 out of 16 states and enacted background check laws in 18 states. They also celebrate the passage of a protective order law in California, which allows police or family members to intervene if someone displays disturbing behavior. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with gun control advocates pushing for restrictions in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. The NRA's influence has been challenged, with advocates claiming the wind is at their backs for the first time. The article highlights the ongoing tug of war between advocates for gun control and gun rights, with both sides working hard to advance their agendas.
