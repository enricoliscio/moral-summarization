SUMMARY:

Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the battle over gun laws, despite the NRA's dominance in the past. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, 18 states have enacted background check laws, and gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA's biggest victories came in Kansas and Maine, which passed laws allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, while gun-control advocates celebrated wins in California, where a new law allows police or family members to take action against individuals who make threats or display disturbing behavior. The law was designed in response to the 2014 Isla Vista shooting rampage. Both sides are pulling harder, with gun-control advocates working to restrict access to guns in blue and purple states, and the NRA arguing that arming more people is the key to preventing mass shootings. Despite defeats, gun-control advocates boast about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states. END OF SUMMARY.
