Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I'll read the article carefully. It's about the ongoing debate on gun control in the US, highlighting recent developments and the strategies of both sides. The author uses several morally charged words, so my first step is to identify those. 

I'll go through the article word by word. Words like "draw," "momentum," "failed push," "wind at our backs," "third rail," "victories," "cheered," "unsettled," "ban," "infringe," "constitutional rights," "promising model," "defeats," "sail through," "stepped up," and "pulling harder" stand out as morally framed. These words carry connotations of struggle, progress, rights, and justice.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by noting the stalemate in the gun control debate, mention the progress made by advocates despite federal failures, and the states that have passed background checks. I'll also highlight the NRA's successes in Kansas and Maine, and the new laws in Texas. 

Then, I'll cover the California law, its purpose, and the concerns it raised. I'll conclude by mentioning the ongoing efforts of both sides, with gun control groups opposing NRA-backed bills and the NRA pushing for more access. 

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key points while preserving the moral framing. I'll structure it to show the balance of power and the ongoing struggle between the two sides. 

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's within the word limit and that all the morally framed words are included appropriately. This should meet the user's requirements effectively.

### SUMMARY:
The gun control debate in the U.S. remains a stalemate, with both sides making gains. Advocates for stricter gun laws, emboldened since the Sandy Hook tragedy, have passed background check laws in 18 states, though federal efforts have stalled. Groups like Moms Demand Action feel optimistic, seeing progress in countering NRA-backed initiatives. Meanwhile, the NRA has won in states like Kansas and Maine, where new laws allow concealed carry without permits. Texas’ open carry and campus carry laws have sparked mixed reactions, with some businesses banning guns and others adapting to the new reality. California’s new protective-order law, designed to prevent mass shootings, has been praised as a promising model, though critics worry about constitutional rights. Despite setbacks in states like Texas, gun-control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, have successfully blocked NRA-backed campus-carry laws in 14 out of 16 states. The battle over gun laws continues to intensify, with both sides pulling harder in their respective efforts.  
END OF SUMMARY.
