SUMMARY: Despite setbacks at the federal level and in several states, advocates for stricter gun control measures in the United States are claiming momentum in their battle against the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). While the NRA scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing concealed carry without a permit, gun control advocates have successfully blocked campus carry laws in 14 states and expanded background check laws to 18 states. They also celebrated the passage of a California protective-order law, which allows police or family members to take action if someone displays disturbing behavior that falls short of a crime. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with gun control advocates pushing for restrictions in blue and purple states, while the NRA and its allies argue that arming more people is the solution to mass shootings. The gun control movement has gained traction since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, and advocates feel they now have the wind at their backs, challenging the NRA's once-dominant influence.
