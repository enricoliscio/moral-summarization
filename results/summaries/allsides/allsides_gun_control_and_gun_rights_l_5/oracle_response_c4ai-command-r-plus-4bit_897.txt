SUMMARY: In the ongoing battle between gun control advocates and the National Rifle Association (NRA), the former have claimed momentum following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. While a push for stricter gun control laws at the federal level has failed, several states have enacted background check laws and advocates have successfully fought NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA, however, has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, passing laws allowing concealed carry without a permit. The tug-of-war between the two sides has intensified, with gun control advocates restricting access in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people in more places is the solution to mass shootings. Gun control advocates have also stopped campus-carry laws in 14 states, a significant shift from the past. The California protective-order law is a notable win for gun control, allowing action to be taken if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. The battle over gun laws remains heated, with both sides claiming victories and working to advance their agendas.
END OF SUMMARY.
