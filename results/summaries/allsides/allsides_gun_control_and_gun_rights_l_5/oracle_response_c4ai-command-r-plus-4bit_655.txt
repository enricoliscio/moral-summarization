SUMMARY: Despite setbacks at the federal level, advocates for stricter gun control measures have made significant progress in recent years, particularly at the state level. Since the devastating massacre of young children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, the movement for gun control has gained momentum and claimed several victories. Six additional states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18. Advocates have also successfully fought against NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and have protected legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. While the NRA has scored some wins, such as passing laws allowing concealed carry without a permit in Kansas and Maine, gun control advocates have effectively restricted access in other states. They have also stopped campus-carry laws from being enacted in 14 out of 16 states where bills were introduced. The California protective-order law is a notable success for gun control advocates, allowing police and family members to take action if someone displays threatening behavior without arresting them or committing them involuntarily. The battle over gun laws has intensified, with both sides fighting harder than ever. Gun control advocates are restricting access in blue and purple states, while the NRA advocates for arming more people in more places to prevent mass shootings. The struggle between these two forces continues, with advocates for stricter gun control measures gaining ground and refusing to let gun rights expansion be a third rail issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
