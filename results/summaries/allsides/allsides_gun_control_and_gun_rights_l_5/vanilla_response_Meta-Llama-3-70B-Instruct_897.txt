SUMMARY:

Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the political environment, despite the NRA's dominance. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, 18 states have enacted background check laws, and gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The NRA has had victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit. However, gun-control advocates have had wins in California, where a new law allows police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior. Both sides are pulling harder in the state-level battle over gun laws, with gun-control advocates stepping up efforts to restrict access in blue and purple states, while the NRA argues that arming more people in more places is the key to preventing mass shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
