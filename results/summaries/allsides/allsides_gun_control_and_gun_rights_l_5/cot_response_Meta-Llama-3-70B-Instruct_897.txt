SUMMARY:
Advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum in the battle over gun laws, despite the NRA's continued influence. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, eight additional states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18 nationwide. While the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. The California protective-order law, which allows police or family members to take action if a person makes threats or displays disturbing behavior, is seen as a promising model for other states to follow. Despite setbacks, gun-control advocates are boasting about stopping NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 states. END OF SUMMARY.
