SUMMARY:

In the ongoing battle over gun control, advocates for stricter laws claim momentum despite the NRA's continued influence. Since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, an additional six states have enacted background check laws, bringing the total to 18 nationwide. Advocates have also improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights and protecting legislators targeted by the NRA in elections. While the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit, gun-control advocates have stopped NRA-backed efforts to enact campus-carry laws in 14 of 16 states. California's new protective-order law, designed in response to the 2014 shooting rampage by Eliot Rodger, allows police or family members to take action against individuals who make threats or display disturbing behavior. Gun-control advocates see this law as a promising model for other states to follow, aiming to restrict access to guns and prevent mass shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
