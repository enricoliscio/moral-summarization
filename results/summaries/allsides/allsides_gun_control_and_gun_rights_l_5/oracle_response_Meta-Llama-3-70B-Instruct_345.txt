SUMMARY:

In the ongoing battle over gun laws, advocates for stricter gun control claim momentum, despite the NRA's continued influence. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, 18 states have enacted background check laws, and gun-control advocates have improved their record in fighting NRA-backed attempts to expand gun rights. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, feels that the wind is finally at their backs, and gun control is no longer a "third rail" in politics. However, the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, passing laws allowing concealed carry without a permit. California's new protective-order law, designed to prevent shootings like the 2014 Isla Vista rampage, allows police to take action against individuals who make threats or display disturbing behavior. Gun-control advocates see this as a promising model for other states to follow. As the battle rages on, both sides are pulling harder, with gun-control advocates working to restrict access to guns and the NRA arguing that arming more people is the key to preventing mass shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
