Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what moral framing means. It's about the language used to convey values or judgments, like "momentum" or "victories." 

The article talks about the gun control debate, so I should look for words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through the text and pick out those words. Words like "momentum," "failed," "improved," "wind at our backs," "third rail," "victories," "cheered," "unsettled," "ban," "disadvantage," "infringe," "promising," "sail through," and "defeats." 

Now, for the summary. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should highlight both sides: gun control advocates gaining momentum despite federal failures, states enacting laws, NRA's victories, and the ongoing battle. I'll structure it to show the balance between the two sides, emphasizing the moral language to reflect the author's framing.

I should start by mentioning the overall stalemate, then detail the progress on background checks and the new California law. Next, I'll note the NRA's successes and the reactions, including business responses and the Texas laws. Finally, I'll conclude with the ongoing efforts and the impact of Bloomberg's funding. 

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me check each point and make sure all key moral terms are included without making it too lengthy. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral perspective of the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The battle over gun control in the U.S. remains a stalemate, with both sides making progress but neither fully dominating. Gun-control advocates, gaining momentum since the Sandy Hook tragedy, have successfully pushed background check laws in 18 states, though federal efforts have failed. They also boast of improved resistance against NRA-backed initiatives, with Shannon Watts claiming "the wind is at our backs." Meanwhile, the NRA has scored victories in Kansas and Maine, where new laws allow concealed carry without permits. In Texas, "open carry" and "campus carry" laws have sparked mixed reactions, with some businesses banning guns and others adjusting to the new norms. A significant win for gun-control advocates came in California, where a new law allows police or family members to take action against individuals showing concerning behavior, a response to the Isla Vista shooting. Despite these advancements, the NRA and its allies continue to argue that arming more people is key to preventing mass shootings. Both sides are intensifying their efforts, with gun-control advocates, backed by funding from Michael Bloomberg, successfully blocking NRA-backed campus-carry bills in 14 out of 16 states.
