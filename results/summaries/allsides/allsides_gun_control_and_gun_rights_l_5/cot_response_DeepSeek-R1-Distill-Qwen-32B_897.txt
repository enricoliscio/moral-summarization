Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the state of gun control in the US, and they want me to first identify all the morally framed single words, then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words mean. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, reflecting values or judgments. So, I'll go through the article and pick out words like "momentum," "failed," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded," "expanded,"
