SUMMARY: NFL star Drew Brees was criticized by LGBTQ+ activists and their allies for participating in a Bible advocacy group's campaign aimed at encouraging children to bring Bibles to school and publicly express their Christian faith. In a promotional video, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to talk about their faith. However, the group promoting this initiative has been accused of being anti-LGBTQ+ and supporting conversion therapy, leading to backlash against Brees. He was accused of being a "bigot" and supporting discrimination. Brees responded by stating that he did not support discrimination or inequality and that he lived by the belief of "love all, respect all, and accept all." He expressed confusion about the backlash and denied supporting any agenda beyond encouraging kids to bring their Bibles to school.
