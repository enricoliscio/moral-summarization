SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, who is outspoken about his Christian faith, recorded a video promoting the program, which was met with criticism from allies of the LGBTQ agenda. They labeled the group behind the program as a "racist discriminatory religious cult" and "anti-gay," and accused Brees of being a "bigot" aligned with a "hateful group." Brees responded to the online furor, saying he was falsely smeared by a deceptive article and that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He denied supporting any groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and hopes to set the record straight. END OF SUMMARY.
