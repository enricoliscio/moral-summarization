SUMMARY: NFL quarterback Drew Brees has come under fire from the LGBT lobby and its allies for his participation in a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith openly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to talk about their faith. However, his actions were met with backlash as some accused him of aligning with a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" and supporting gay conversion therapy. Brees denied these claims, stating that he believes in loving, respecting, and accepting all people, and that he does not support discriminatory or agenda-driven groups. He expressed confusion as to why his encouragement to bring Bibles to school sparked negativity and stood firm in his commitment to sharing God's love. The incident highlights the ongoing tension between religious expression and LGBT rights in the public sphere, with Brees' intentions being misconstrued and used to fuel divisive narratives.
