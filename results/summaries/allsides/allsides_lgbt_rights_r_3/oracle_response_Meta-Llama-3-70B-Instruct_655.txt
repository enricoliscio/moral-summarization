SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to share God's love with friends, emphasizing that "you're not alone." However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda accused Brees of supporting a "racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes "conversion therapy" and "fights against any anti-discrimination laws." Brees responded, saying he was falsely smeared and that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and hopes to set the record straight. Brees' message of faith, love, and respect was lost in the negativity, as he was wrongly accused of being a "bigot" and supporting hateful agendas.

END OF SUMMARY.
