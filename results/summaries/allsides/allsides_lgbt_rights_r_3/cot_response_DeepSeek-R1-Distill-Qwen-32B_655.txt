Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Drew Brees and his response to criticism from the LGBT lobby. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, the user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. I should look for words that carry a strong moral connotation. Let me go through the article again.

I see words like "broad-sided," "support," "innocuous," "advocating," "Christian," "faith," "love," "excited," "excoriated," "anti-gay," "conversion therapy," "discrimination," "hateful," "false," "smeared," "deceptive," "love all," "respect all," "accept all," "discriminate," "inequality," "bigot," "hateful." These all carry moral weight.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture the conflict between Brees supporting a Bible program and the backlash from the LGBT community. I should mention his response clarifying his stance on equality and love.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points: Brees' support, the criticism, his response, and his moral stance. I need to keep it concise but comprehensive, making sure the moral framing is preserved.

I think I've got all the necessary points. Now, I'll structure the summary to include the main events and the moral terms identified. I'll start with Brees supporting the program, then the backlash, followed by his clarification and his values.

Let me check the word count to make sure it's under 200. It looks good. I think this should meet the user's requirements.

**SUMMARY:**  
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby after supporting a program encouraging children to bring Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, an outspoken Christian, promoted the initiative in a video, emphasizing his belief in "love all, respect all, and accept all." Critics, including Robert Littal of Black Sports Online and Deadspin, accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" and "anti-gay religious cult" linked to conversion therapy and discrimination. Brees responded, denying any support for discriminatory groups and calling the criticism a "false smear." He emphasized his commitment to equality and urged everyone to move past the negativity. The controversy highlights tensions between religious advocacy and LGBTQ rights.
