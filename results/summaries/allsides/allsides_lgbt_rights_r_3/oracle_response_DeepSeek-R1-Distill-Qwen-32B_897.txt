Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and the specific morally framed words. I need to make sure I include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about Drew Brees supporting a program where kids bring Bibles to school, which upset the LGBT lobby. They called him a bigot and associated him with conversion therapy. Brees defended himself, saying he supports love, respect, and acceptance, and doesn't support discrimination.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words: bring, live, faith, guided, share, conversion, fights, bigot, smeared, love, respect, accept, rope, support, discriminate, inequality.

I should structure the summary to include these words. Start with Brees supporting the program, using "bring" and "live" his faith. Then mention the criticism using "conversion therapy," "bigot," and "smeared." Finally, Brees's response with "love," "respect," "accept," and his stance against discrimination and inequality.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure each key point is covered with the moral terms.

SUMMARY: NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live out their Christian faith. Brees, guided by his faith, shared a video promoting the initiative, urging kids to "share God's love" and emphasizing that they are not alone. Critics accused him of supporting a "bigot" and aligning with a "hateful group," falsely smearing him as associated with conversion therapy and discrimination. Deadspin and others attacked his stance, linking it to anti-LGBTQ agendas. Brees responded, clarifying his support for "love, respect, and acceptance," and denied backing any groups that promote inequality or discrimination. He emphasized his commitment to unity and rejected the negative framing, urging everyone to move forward. END OF SUMMARY.
