Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Drew Brees supported a program allowing kids to bring Bibles to school, which was met with backlash from the LGBTQ lobby. They accused him of supporting a homophobic group, but Brees defended himself, emphasizing love, respect, and acceptance.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. These include words like "bring," "live," "faith," "conversion," "bigot," "smeared," etc. I must ensure these words are included in the summary to maintain the original moral tone.

I should structure the summary to first mention Brees' support for the program, then the backlash, and finally his response. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me start drafting, making sure to include all the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Finally, I'll format it with the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBTQ lobby after supporting a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live out their Christian faith publicly. Brees, a vocal Christian, shared a video promoting the initiative, urging kids to "live out your faith" and "share God's love." Critics accused him of aligning with a "hateful group" and "bigotry," linking the program to "conversion therapy" and discrimination. Brees responded, denying support for discriminatory agendas and emphasizing his commitment to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that his intent was to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school, not to promote inequality. Despite his efforts to clear the air, the controversy persisted, with some accusing him of being "smeared" by misleading claims. Brees maintained that his actions were about faith, not hate, and urged the conversation to move forward. END OF SUMMARY.
