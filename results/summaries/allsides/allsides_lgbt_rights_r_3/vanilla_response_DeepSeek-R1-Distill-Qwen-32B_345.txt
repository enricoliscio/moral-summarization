Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Drew Brees and the controversy surrounding his support for a Bible program. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

Drew Brees, an NFL quarterback, supports a program that allows kids to bring Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. He made a video encouraging kids to do this. But the LGBT lobby isn't happy about it. They're accusing him of supporting a group that's against their rights, calling it a "racist" and "anti-gay" group. Some media outlets, like Deadspin, ran headlines that suggested Brees supports gay conversion therapy, which he doesn't. Brees responded by saying he was misrepresented and that he stands for love, respect, and acceptance. He clarified that he doesn't support any discriminatory groups.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these points: Brees' support for the program, the backlash from the LGBT lobby, the media's role in the controversy, and his response clarifying his stance. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and factual without any bias.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Brees' support, then the backlash, mention the media's part, and end with his response. I should use neutral language to present both sides without taking a position. Also, include the quotes where necessary to highlight his stance.

I think that's all. Let me put it together now.
