Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user has provided a specific query, so I should focus on that. The article is about Drew Brees facing backlash for supporting a Bible in schools program. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Brees is a well-known quarterback who supports a program encouraging kids to bring Bibles to school. He made a video where he talked about his Christian faith and encouraged kids to share their beliefs. 

Then, the LGBTQ lobby reacted negatively, accusing him of supporting a "racist" and "discriminatory" group. Some media outlets ran headlines that linked him to conversion therapy, which is a sensitive issue. 

Brees responded by clarifying his stance, saying he supports love and respect for all, and that he doesn't support discrimination. He was upset about being falsely smeared.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key elements: Brees' support for the program, the backlash from the LGBTQ community, the media's role, and his response. 

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Also, I need to present both sides of the story to provide a balanced view. 

Let me structure it: start with Brees' support, mention the backlash, include the media's reaction, and then his clarification. Keep each part brief but informative. 

I should also ensure that the summary doesn't take sides but just reports the facts. That way, it remains objective. 

Finally, I'll format it with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as the user instructed.
