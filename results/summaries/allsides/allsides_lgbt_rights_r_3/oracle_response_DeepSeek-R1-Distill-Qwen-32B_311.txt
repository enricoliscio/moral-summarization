Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral terms involved.

Drew Brees supported a program encouraging kids to bring Bibles to school and live their Christian faith. He was criticized by the LGBTQ lobby, who called the group a "racist discriminatory religious cult" and linked it to conversion therapy and anti-discrimination fights. They accused him of being a bigot and supporting hateful groups. Brees defended himself, saying he supports love, respect, and acceptance, and that he doesn't support discrimination or inequality.

The author used words like bring, live, faith, guided, share, conversion, fights, bigot, smeared, love, respect, accept, rope, support, discriminate, inequality. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should start by mentioning Brees' support for the program, the criticism from the LGBTQ lobby, their accusations, and his response. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the framing accurately.

Let me structure the summary: Brees supported a Bible program, faced backlash from LGBTQ groups, who accused him of bigotry and supporting harmful groups. Brees denied these claims, emphasizing love, respect, and acceptance, and stated he doesn't support discrimination or inequality.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key moral words. Let me check the word count as I draft.
