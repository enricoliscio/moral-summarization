SUMMARY: NFL quarterback Drew Brees, known for his outspoken Christian faith, has been broadsided by the LGBT lobby and its allies for his support of a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live their faith publicly. In a promotional video, Brees encouraged kids to talk about their Christian beliefs and "share God's love." However, he was met with a backlash from those who support the LGBTQ agenda, who accused him of being a "bigot" and associated with a "hateful group." Brees responded by stating that he does not support discrimination or inequality and that he was falsely smeared by a deceptive article. He emphasized his credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all," and expressed confusion about the negative response to his video. Brees clarified that he simply wanted to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school and asked that people move on from the issue as it does not reflect what he stands for. END OF SUMMARY.
