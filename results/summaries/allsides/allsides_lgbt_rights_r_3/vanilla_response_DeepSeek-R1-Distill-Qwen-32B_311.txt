Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Drew Brees and the backlash he received. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Drew Brees, an NFL quarterback, supported a program where kids bring Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. He made a video encouraging kids to share their faith. However, the LGBT lobby criticized him, calling him a bigot and associating the program with anti-gay groups and conversion therapy. Some media outlets, like Deadspin, ran negative headlines. Brees responded by clarifying his stance, saying he supports love, respect, and acceptance, and that he doesn't support discrimination or inequality.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Brees' support of the program, the backlash from the LGBT lobby, the media's role, and his response.

I'll start by stating that Brees was criticized for supporting the program. Then mention the accusations and media coverage. Finally, include his response and clarification.
