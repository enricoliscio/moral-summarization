SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to share their faith. However, critics accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes conversion therapy and fights against anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded with a video on Instagram, clarifying that he was falsely smeared and does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality. He emphasized his credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." Brees expressed confusion over the negativity and hoped to set the record straight.
