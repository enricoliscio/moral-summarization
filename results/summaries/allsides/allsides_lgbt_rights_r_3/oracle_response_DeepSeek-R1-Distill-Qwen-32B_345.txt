Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Drew Brees supporting a program where kids bring Bibles to school, which has caused controversy with the LGBT lobby. They're accusing him of supporting conversion therapy and discrimination. Brees responded by clarifying his stance, emphasizing love, respect, and acceptance.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: bring, live, faith, guided, share, conversion, fights, bigot, smeared, love, respect, accept, rope, support, discriminate, inequality. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating Brees' support for the program and his Christian faith. Then, mention the backlash from the LGBT lobby, using terms like "conversion therapy," "bigot," and "smeared." I'll include Brees' response where he talks about love, respect, and acceptance, and clarifies he doesn't support discrimination or inequality.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first present Brees' actions, then the criticism, and finally his response. Make sure to include all the key moral terms without making the summary too long.

Let me draft it:

Drew Brees supported a program encouraging kids to bring Bibles to school, promoting their Christian faith. This drew criticism from the LGBT lobby, who accused him of supporting conversion therapy and discrimination. They called him a bigot and smeared his reputation. Brees defended himself, emphasizing love, respect, and acceptance, and denied supporting any groups that discriminate or promote inequality.

That's concise and includes the moral terms. I think this captures the essence while preserving the framing.
