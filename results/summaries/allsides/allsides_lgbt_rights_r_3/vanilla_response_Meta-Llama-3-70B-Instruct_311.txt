SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community after promoting a program encouraging kids to bring their Bibles to school and share their Christian faith. In a video, Brees shared one of his favorite Bible scriptures and encouraged kids to live out their faith. However, critics accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes gay conversion therapy. Brees responded with a video on Instagram, saying he was falsely smeared and does not support any groups that discriminate or promote inequality. He emphasized that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." Brees clarified that he only intended to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school, and not to promote any harmful agendas.
