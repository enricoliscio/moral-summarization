SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for his involvement in a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, known for his outspoken faith, recorded a video promotion where he encouraged kids to talk about their Christian beliefs and "share God's love with friends." However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda excoriated Brees on social media, accusing him of aligning with a discriminatory and hateful group. The controversy centered around accusations of bigotry and deception, with some claiming that Brees supported anti-LGBTQ causes. Brees responded by stating that he advocated for love, respect, and acceptance for all, and that he did not support any discriminatory or inequality-promoting agendas. He expressed confusion about the negative response to his video and attempted to set the record straight by denying support for any discriminatory groups. Brees' statement reflected his belief in loving, respecting, and accepting all individuals, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs.
