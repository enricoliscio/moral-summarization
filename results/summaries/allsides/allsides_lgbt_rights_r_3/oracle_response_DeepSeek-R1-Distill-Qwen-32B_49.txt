Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Drew Brees supported a Bible program, which upset the LGBT lobby. They accused him of being associated with a hateful group, but he defended himself, emphasizing love, respect, and acceptance.

I should start by identifying the key events: Brees supporting the program, the backlash from the LGBT community, and his response. I need to use the provided words like "faith," "conversion," "discriminate," and "inequality."

I'll structure the summary to mention Brees' support, the accusations, and his clarification. I'll ensure the moral terms are included naturally. Also, I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise.

Let me draft a few sentences, making sure each key point is covered and the moral language is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present the summary clearly.
