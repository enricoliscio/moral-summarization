SUMMARY: NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community and its allies for his involvement in a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and openly practice their Christian faith. In a promotional video, Brees referenced his own faith and encouraged students to do the same. However, critics labeled the group behind the initiative as a "religious cult" that supports conversion therapy and opposes anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded to the accusations, denying support for any discriminatory or agenda-driven groups and reaffirming his belief in loving, respecting, and accepting all people. He expressed confusion about the negative response to his video and asserted that his participation was solely to encourage students to bring their Bibles to school. The controversy sparked debates about the intersection of religion and LGBT rights, with Brees' response aiming to clarify his stance and distance himself from any form of discrimination.
