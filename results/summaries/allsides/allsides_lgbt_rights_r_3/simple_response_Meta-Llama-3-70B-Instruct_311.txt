SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live out their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to talk about their faith. However, critics accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes conversion therapy and discrimination against the LGBTQ community. Brees responded with a video on Instagram, clarifying that he was falsely smeared and does not support any groups that discriminate or promote inequality. He emphasized that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." The incident highlights the importance of understanding and respecting different beliefs and values, while also promoting inclusivity and equality for all individuals.
