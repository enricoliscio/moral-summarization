SUMMARY: 
NFL superstar quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBTQ lobby for his participation in an advocacy program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, known for his outspoken faith, recorded a video promoting the event, in which he encouraged kids to talk about their Christian beliefs and "live out their faith." However, allies of the LGBTQ community excoriated Brees on social media, accusing him of aligning with a discriminatory and hateful group that promotes inequality and supports conversion therapy. The online furor led Brees to respond with another video, denying support for any discriminatory agendas and stating that he lives by the values of "love all, respect all, and accept all." Brees expressed confusion about the negative backlash and felt he was unfairly roped into a deceptive smear campaign. He attempted to set the record straight by clarifying his stance and distancing himself from any form of discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
