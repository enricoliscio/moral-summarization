SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, an outspoken Christian, recorded a video promoting the program, encouraging kids to share God's love with friends. However, critics accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes gay conversion therapy and discriminates against the LGBTQ community. Brees responded with a video on Instagram, denying any affiliation with such groups and stating that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that his intention was to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school, not to promote discrimination. Brees' response was an attempt to set the record straight and move forward, emphasizing that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality.
