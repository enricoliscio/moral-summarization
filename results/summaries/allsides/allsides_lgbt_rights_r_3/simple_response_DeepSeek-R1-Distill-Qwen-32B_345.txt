Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Drew Brees and the backlash he received for supporting a Bible program. I need to make sure the summary captures the conflict between Brees' Christian values and the LGBTQ+ criticisms. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Brees supported a program encouraging kids to bring Bibles to school and express their faith. Critics from the LGBTQ+ community accused him of promoting discrimination, even linking it to conversion therapy. Brees defended himself, saying he supports love and acceptance, and that he was misrepresented.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Brees' support for the program and his Christian stance. Then, mention the backlash from the LGBTQ+ lobby, using the specific accusations like "racist" and "anti-gay." I should include the media reactions, like the Deadspin headline and social media comments. Finally, I'll summarize Brees' response, emphasizing his commitment to love and respect, and his denial of supporting discriminatory groups.

I have to ensure the moral framing is preserved, highlighting the clash between religious expression and LGBTQ+ rights. I'll avoid taking sides but present both perspectives clearly. Also, I need to end with the required tokens, so I'll make sure to include "SUMMARY:" at the start and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

Let me structure the summary step by step: introduce Brees and his support, describe the backlash, mention specific criticisms, include Brees' defense, and conclude with his stance on equality. Keeping it all within the word limit is crucial, so I'll be concise with each point without omitting essential details.

I should also check for any potential bias in the summary. Since the user wants the moral framing preserved, I need to present both sides fairly without leaning towards either. That way, the summary remains neutral while highlighting the conflict's moral dimensions.

Alright, I think I have a clear structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within 200 words and includes all necessary points while maintaining the moral context.
