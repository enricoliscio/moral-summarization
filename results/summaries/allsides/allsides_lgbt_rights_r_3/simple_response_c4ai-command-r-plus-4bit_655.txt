SUMMARY: NFL star quarterback Drew Brees has come under fire from the LGBT lobby and its allies for his participation in a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and openly practice their Christian faith. In a promotional video, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to talk about their faith. However, his actions were met with intense backlash, as some labeled the group he supported as a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" and accused Brees of aligning with a "hateful group." Brees defended himself, stating that he advocates for loving, respecting, and accepting all people, and that he does not support any discriminatory or inequality-promoting agendas. He expressed confusion about the negative response to his video and denied supporting any form of discrimination.
