SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees was criticized by the LGBT community for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to share God's love with friends, emphasizing that they are "not alone." However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda accused Brees of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes conversion therapy and fights against anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded to the backlash, stating that he was falsely smeared and that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and hopes to set the record straight. Brees' message of love, respect, and acceptance was overshadowed by the negativity spread by others.
