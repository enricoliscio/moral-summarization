SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, who has been outspoken about his Christian faith, recorded a video promoting the program, which was met with criticism from allies of the LGBTQ agenda. They labeled the group as "racist," “discriminatory,” and “anti-gay,” and accused Brees of being a “bigot” aligned with a “hateful group.” However, Brees responded by saying he was falsely smeared and that he lives by the credo to “love all, respect all, and accept all.” He denied supporting any groups that discriminate or promote inequality. Brees' statement aimed to set the record straight and move on from the negativity. END OF SUMMARY.
