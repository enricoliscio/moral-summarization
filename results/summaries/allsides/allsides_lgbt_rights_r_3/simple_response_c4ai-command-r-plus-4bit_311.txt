However, his actions were misconstrued and he was falsely accused of being aligned with a "hateful group" that promotes conversion therapy and discriminates against the LGBTQ community. Brees responded to the accusations, stating that he believes in loving, respecting, and accepting all people, and that he does not support any form of discrimination or inequality. He was saddened by the negativity and false accusations, but stood firm in his faith and his belief in treating everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their beliefs or background.
