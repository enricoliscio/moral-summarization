SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBTQ lobby after showing support for a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, known for his outspoken faith, recorded a video promotion encouraging kids to talk about their religion and "share God's love." However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda excoriated him on social media, accusing him of aligning with a discriminatory and hateful group. They labeled the program as a "gay conversion therapy" initiative. Brees responded by stating that he was falsely smeared and that he does not support any form of discrimination or inequality. He clarified that he advocates for loving, respecting, and accepting everyone, regardless of their beliefs. Brees expressed confusion about the negative backlash and stood firm in his support for religious expression in schools.
