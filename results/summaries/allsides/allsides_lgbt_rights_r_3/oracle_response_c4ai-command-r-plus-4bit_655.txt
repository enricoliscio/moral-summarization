SUMMARY: NFL star Drew Brees is facing backlash from the LGBT lobby for his participation in a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live out their Christian faith. Brees, who has been open about his own faith, recorded a video for the program in which he encouraged kids to talk about their beliefs and shared one of his favorite Bible scriptures. However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda criticized Brees, accusing him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" and aligning with a group that promotes "gay conversion therapy." Brees responded to the accusations, stating that he was falsely smeared and that he believes in loving, respecting, and accepting all people, regardless of their beliefs. He clarified that he does not support any form of discrimination or inequality and that his participation in the program was simply about encouraging kids to share their faith. Brees' stance on this issue highlights the ongoing tension between religious freedom and LGBT rights, with some accusing him of promoting intolerance while others defend his right to express his faith.
