SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to share God's love with friends, saying "You're not alone." However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda smeared Brees on social media, calling the group a "racist discriminatory religious cult" and accusing him of supporting "gay conversion therapy." Brees responded with a video on Instagram, saying he was falsely accused and that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and that his intention was to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school and live their faith. Brees emphasized that he stands for love, respect, and acceptance, not discrimination or inequality.

END OF SUMMARY.
