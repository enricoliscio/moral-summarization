SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages kids to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to share God's love with friends. However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda excoriated him on social media, labeling the group as a "racist discriminatory religious cult" and "anti-Gay Religious Cult." Brees responded with a video, saying he was falsely smeared and that he stands for "love all, respect all, and accept all." He denied supporting groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and instead encouraged kids to live out their faith without negativity. END OF SUMMARY.
