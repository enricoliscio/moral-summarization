Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral perspective.

Drew Brees, an NFL quarterback, supported a program encouraging kids to bring Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. He made a video promoting this, which the LGBT lobby criticized. They accused him of supporting a "racist" and "anti-gay" group. Some media outlets, like Deadspin, ran headlines suggesting he supports conversion therapy. Brees responded, clarifying he supports love, respect, and acceptance, and that he doesn't back discriminatory groups.

The moral framing here seems to present Brees as a victim of unfair attacks by the LGBT lobby and media. The author likely portrays Brees as someone promoting religious freedom and being falsely accused. The summary should reflect this perspective without taking sides but highlighting the conflict between religious expression and LGBTQ rights.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all key elements: Brees' support, the criticism, media reactions, and his response. Also, I should maintain the moral tone that Brees was unfairly targeted for his religious advocacy.

Let me structure it: Start with Brees' action, then the criticism, media's role, and his defense. Make sure to include the accusations and his clarification.

I should avoid any bias, just present the facts as per the article's framing. So, the summary will show Brees promoting a Christian program, facing backlash from LGBTQ advocates, media coverage, and his response denying support for discrimination.

I think that covers all necessary points while preserving the moral angle presented in the article.
