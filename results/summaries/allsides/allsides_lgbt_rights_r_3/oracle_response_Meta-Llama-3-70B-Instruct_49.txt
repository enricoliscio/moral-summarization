SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees was attacked by the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to talk about their faith, saying "I want to encourage you to live out your faith... and share God's love with friends." However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda smeared Brees, calling the program a "racist discriminatory religious cult" that supports "gay conversion therapy" and "fights against any anti-discrimination laws." Brees responded, saying he was falsely accused and that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and that his intention was to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school, not to support harmful agendas. Brees' message of love, respect, and acceptance was lost in the negativity and false accusations.

END OF SUMMARY.
