SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community after promoting a program encouraging kids to bring their Bibles to school and share their Christian faith. Brees, an outspoken Christian, recorded a video for the program, which was met with criticism on social media. Many accused him of supporting a "hateful group" and "anti-gay religious cult" that advocates for conversion therapy. However, Brees responded with a video on Instagram, clarifying that he does not support discrimination or inequality. He emphasized his credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." Brees stated that he was falsely smeared by a deceptive article and only intended to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school for National Bring Your Bible to School Day. He hopes to set the record straight and move on from the controversy.
