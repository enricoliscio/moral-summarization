Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Drew Brees and the controversy surrounding his support for a Bible program. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

Drew Brees, an NFL quarterback, supports a program encouraging kids to bring Bibles to school. He made a video promoting it, talking about his Christian faith and encouraging kids to share their faith. Then, the LGBT lobby criticized him. They called him a bigot and associated the group with anti-gay practices like conversion therapy. Some media outlets ran negative headlines, like Deadspin. Brees responded on Instagram, clarifying that he supports love and acceptance, and doesn't support discrimination or inequality.

I need to capture the conflict here: Brees promoting his faith, the backlash from the LGBT side, and his response. The moral framing is about religious freedom vs. discrimination. So in the summary, I should mention Brees's support for the program, the criticism from the LGBT lobby, the media's role, and his defense against the accusations.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Let me structure it: start with Brees's support, then the backlash, media's role, and his response. Make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed.

Also, the user wants the summary after "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly.

Let me draft it: Brees supported a program for kids to bring Bibles, faced backlash from LGBT groups calling him a bigot, media ran negative stories, Brees defended himself saying he supports love and doesn't back discrimination.

Wait, need to include that the groups accused him of supporting a cult and conversion therapy. Also, Brees mentioned his stance on love, respect, and acceptance. Maybe mention that he was trying to clear the air.

I think that's the main points. Let me put it together concisely.
