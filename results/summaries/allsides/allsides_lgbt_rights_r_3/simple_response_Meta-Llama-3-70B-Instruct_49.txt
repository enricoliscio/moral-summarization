SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live out their Christian faith publicly. Brees, an outspoken Christian, recorded a video promoting the program, encouraging kids to share God's love with friends. However, critics accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that advocates for conversion therapy and opposes anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded with a video on Instagram, clarifying that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and instead stands by the credo "love all, respect all, and accept all." He expressed confusion over the negativity and urged people to move on. The incident highlights the tension between religious freedom and LGBTQ rights, with some accusing Brees of promoting hate and others defending his right to express his faith.
