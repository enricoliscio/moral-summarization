SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community after promoting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video, Brees shared one of his favorite Bible scriptures and encouraged kids to talk about their faith. However, critics accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes gay conversion therapy and fights against anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded to the criticism with a video on Instagram, stating that he was falsely smeared and does not support any groups that discriminate or promote inequality. He emphasized that his message was about encouraging kids to live out their faith and share God's love with friends. Brees clarified that he stands for "love all, respect all, and accept all."
