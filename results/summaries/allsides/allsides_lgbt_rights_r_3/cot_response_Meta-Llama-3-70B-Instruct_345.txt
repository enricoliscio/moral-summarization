SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, who is outspoken about his Christian faith, recorded a video promoting the program, urging kids to share God's love with friends. However, allies of the LGBT agenda labeled the group behind the program as a "racist discriminatory religious cult" and "Anti-Gay Religious Cult" that supports "gay conversion therapy." Brees responded to the online furor, denying any affiliation with hateful groups and emphasizing that he stands for "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality. Despite the negativity, Brees hopes to set the record straight and move forward.
