SUMMARY: NFL quarterback Drew Brees was attacked by the LGBTQ lobby and its allies in the media for participating in a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith openly. In a video promoting the program, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to talk about their faith. However, his actions were misconstrued and he was falsely accused of supporting "gay conversion therapy" and aligning with a "discriminatory" and "anti-gay" religious cult. Brees responded to the online backlash with a video statement, clarifying that he supports the inclusion and respect of all people, regardless of their beliefs or identities. He distanced himself from any groups that promote inequality or discrimination and reaffirmed his belief in loving, respecting, and accepting everyone. The incident highlights the ongoing tension between religious freedom and LGBTQ rights, with Brees finding himself caught in the crossfire.
