SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT community for supporting a program that encourages kids to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a promotional video, Brees shared one of his favorite Bible scriptures and encouraged kids to share God's love with friends. However, critics accused him of supporting a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that promotes gay conversion therapy and fights against anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded with a video on Instagram, saying he was falsely smeared and that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that he does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and hoped to set the record straight. Brees' statement aimed to clear up the controversy and move forward.
