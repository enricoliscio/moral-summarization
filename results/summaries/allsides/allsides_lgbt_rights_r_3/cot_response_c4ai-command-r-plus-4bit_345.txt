SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees is facing backlash from the LGBTQ lobby for his participation in an innocuous program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith openly. Brees, who has been outspoken about his faith, recorded a video promotion for the program where he encouraged kids to talk about their Christian beliefs and "share God's love." However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda excoriated Brees on social media, accusing him of aligning with a discriminatory and hateful group that promotes conversion therapy and fights against anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded to the accusations, denying support for any discriminatory or inequality agendas and stating that he lives by the principle of "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that his involvement was limited to encouraging kids to bring their Bibles to school and expressed confusion about the negative backlash. Brees asserted that he does not stand for discrimination or inequality.
