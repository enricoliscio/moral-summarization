Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the context. It's about Drew Brees supporting a Bible program and facing backlash from the LGBTQ community.

The user has specified two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary. For the first step, I need to go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "broadside," "innocuous," "outspoken," "excoriated," "smeared," "deceptive," "bigot," "hateful," "discriminate," "inequality," and "credibility" stand out as they carry strong moral judgments.

Next, I need to craft a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without making it too long. I should mention Brees's support for the program, the backlash from the LGBTQ lobby, the accusations made, and his response clarifying his stance. It's important to highlight both sides of the moral framing to present a balanced view.

I also need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and clearly structured. I'll start by introducing Brees and his support, then the criticism he received, followed by his response. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to preserve the original framing.

Finally, I'll check that the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content. Making sure not to add any personal opinions, just sticking to the facts and the moral language used.

**SUMMARY:**  
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBTQ lobby after supporting a program encouraging children to bring Bibles to school and live out their Christian faith. Brees, an outspoken Christian, promoted the initiative in a video, encouraging kids to share God's love. Critics accused him of aligning with a "hateful group" and a "known racist discriminatory religious cult" that supports conversion therapy and opposes anti-discrimination laws. Deadspin called the program "gay conversion therapy sickos," while others labeled Brees a "bigot." Brees responded, denying any ties to discriminatory groups and emphasizing his commitment to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that his intent was to support Bring Your Bible to School Day and urged the negativity to stop, stating he does not support inequality or discrimination. The controversy highlights tensions between religious expression and LGBTQ rights.
