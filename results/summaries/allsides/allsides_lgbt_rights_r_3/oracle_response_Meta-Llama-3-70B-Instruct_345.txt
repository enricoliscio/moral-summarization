SUMMARY:

NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. In a video promotion, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to share God's love with friends, emphasizing that they're not alone. However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda smeared Brees on social media, labeling the group as "racist," "discriminatory," and "anti-gay." They accused Brees of being a "bigot" and supporting a "hateful group" that promotes conversion therapy and fights against anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded with a video, saying he was falsely accused and that he lives by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." He clarified that he doesn't support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, and hopes to set the record straight. END OF SUMMARY.
