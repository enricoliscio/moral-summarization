SUMMARY: NFL star Drew Brees was heavily criticized by the LGBTQ lobby for expressing support for a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith openly. In a promotional video, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to talk about their faith. However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda, including Robert Littal and Deadspin, attacked Brees, accusing him of aligning with a discriminatory "religious cult" that promotes "gay conversion therapy." Brees defended himself against these accusations, stating that he believes in loving, respecting, and accepting all people, and that he does not support any form of discrimination or inequality. He clarified that his participation in the program was simply to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school and share God's love. Brees' stance highlights the ongoing tension between religious freedom and LGBTQ rights, with some accusing him of promoting discrimination while he asserts his commitment to love and respect for all.
