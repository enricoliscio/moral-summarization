Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Drew Brees supporting a program where kids bring Bibles to school. He's a Christian and made a video encouraging kids to share their faith. But the LGBT lobby is upset, calling him a bigot and associating him with a "hateful group." They also link him to conversion therapy, which is a big issue. Brees defended himself, saying he supports love, respect, and acceptance, and that he doesn't support discrimination.

I need to capture the conflict between Brees' religious support and the LGBT community's reaction. The moral framing is important hereâ€”on one side, it's about religious freedom and personal faith, and on the other, it's about discrimination and LGBTQ rights. I should make sure the summary reflects both perspectives without bias.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it ends with the required tokens. Let me structure it by first stating Brees' support, then the backlash, his response, and the underlying conflict. That should cover all the key points while maintaining the moral aspects presented in the article.
