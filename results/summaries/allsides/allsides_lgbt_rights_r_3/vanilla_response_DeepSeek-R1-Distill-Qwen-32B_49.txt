Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about Drew Brees, an NFL quarterback, facing backlash from the LGBT lobby. He supported a program where kids bring Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees is known for his Christian faith and made a video encouraging kids to share their faith.

Then, the backlash comes in. People like Robert Littal and outlets like Deadspin criticized him, calling the group a "racist discriminatory religious cult" and linking it to conversion therapy. Others on Twitter accused him of being a bigot.

Brees responded on Instagram, clarifying that he supports love, respect, and acceptance. He said his video was just about encouraging kids to bring Bibles to school and denied supporting any discriminatory groups.

I need to summarize this in under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should include the key points: Brees' support of the Bible program, the backlash from the LGBT lobby, the accusations of being linked to conversion therapy and discrimination, and his response denying those claims and emphasizing love and respect.

I need to keep it concise and make sure it's clear and accurate. Let me structure it step by step to cover all main points without getting too detailed.
