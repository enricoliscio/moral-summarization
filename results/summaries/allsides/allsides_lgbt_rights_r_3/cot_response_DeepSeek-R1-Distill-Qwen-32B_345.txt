Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Drew Brees and the controversy around his support for a Bible in schools program. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those terms. 

First, I'll go through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. The article mentions the LGBT lobby, which is a group advocating for LGBTQ rights, so that's a moral stance. Then, it talks about Brees supporting a program that's about children bringing Bibles to school and living their Christian faith publicly. That's about religious freedom and expression, which are moral issues.

The article says Brees was "broad-sided" by the LGBT lobby. "Broad-sided" here implies a sudden and forceful attack, which is a negative moral judgment. The program is described as "innocuous," meaning it's harmless, so that's a positive moral framing.

Brees is "outrspoken" about his faith, which is a positive trait in terms of honesty and conviction. The video he made encourages kids to share God's love, which is a positive moral message. 

Then, the backlash comes from "Allies of the LGBTQ agenda." Agenda here is a term that can be seen as negative, implying a push for change that others oppose. Robert Littal calls the group a "known racist, discriminatory religious cult" and an "Anti-Gay Religious Cult That Believes in Conversion Therapy & Fights Against Any Anti-Discrimination Laws." These are strong negative moral words, accusing the group of racism, discrimination, and opposing anti-discrimination laws.

Deadspin's headline uses "gay conversion therapy sickos," which is a very negative term, implying that the group is harmful and insane. Others on Twitter accuse Brees of being a "bigot" and aligned with a "hateful group," both strong negative moral terms.

Brees responds, saying he stands for "love all, respect all, and accept all," positive moral values. He clarifies he supports "equality" and doesn't support groups that "discriminate" or "promote inequality." These are positive and negative moral terms respectively.

So compiling all the morally framed words: LGBT, innocuous, Christian, Anti-Gay, cult, conversion therapy, Anti-Discrimination, bigot, hateful, love, respect, accept, equality, discriminate, inequality.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating that Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program allowing kids to bring Bibles to school. Then mention the negative terms used against him and his response emphasizing love, respect, and equality. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and include the key moral words.
