SUMMARY: NFL star Drew Brees was criticized by the LGBT lobby for his support of a program encouraging children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith openly. In a promotional video, Brees shared his favorite Bible scripture and encouraged kids to share their faith with others. However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda accused Brees of being aligned with a discriminatory "religious cult" that promotes conversion therapy and fights against anti-discrimination laws. Brees responded by stating that he "love[s] all, respect[s] all, and accept[s] all" and that he does not support any groups that discriminate or promote inequality. He clarified that his involvement was simply to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school and expressed confusion about the negative backlash.
END OF SUMMARY.
