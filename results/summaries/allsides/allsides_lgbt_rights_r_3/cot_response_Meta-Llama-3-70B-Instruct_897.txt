SUMMARY:
NFL quarterback Drew Brees faced backlash from the LGBT lobby for supporting a program that encourages children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith publicly. Brees, who has been outspoken about his Christian faith, recorded a video promoting the program, encouraging kids to share God's love with friends. However, allies of the LGBTQ agenda labeled the group behind the program as a "racist discriminatory religious cult" and "Anti-Gay Religious Cult" that supports conversion therapy. Brees was accused of being a "bigot" and aligning with a "hateful group." He responded with a video, saying he was falsely smeared and does not support groups that discriminate or promote inequality, instead living by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all." Brees hoped to set the record straight and move on from the negativity. END OF SUMMARY.
