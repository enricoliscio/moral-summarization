SUMMARY: 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for the unborn, in favor of pro-abortion groups' rights to free expression and association. The ACLU argues that the pro-life ordinances in these cities violate the rights of abortion providers and pro-abortion entities, designating them as "criminal organizations." The lawsuit contends that this hampers their ability to operate, speak, and associate within these cities, as well as counter the confusion created by the ordinances regarding the legality of abortion services. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, asserts that the ordinances are unconstitutional and that abortion is legal across the country. Meanwhile, Mark Dickson, director of Right to Life East Texas, defends the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law, offering legal support to defend them. The lawsuit and the pro-life movement in Texas highlight the ongoing debate and legal battles surrounding abortion rights and access in the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
