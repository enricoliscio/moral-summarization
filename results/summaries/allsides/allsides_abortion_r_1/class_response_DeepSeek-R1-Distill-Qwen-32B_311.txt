Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the ACLU filing a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves sanctuary cities for unborn children. The ACLU is representing pro-abortion groups, arguing that the towns' ordinances violate their rights. The towns passed these ordinances to protect unborn life, and the ACLU claims this misleads residents about the legality of abortion. They also argue that designating abortion providers as criminal organizations hampers their ability to operate, which is unconstitutional.

I need to identify the key elements: the lawsuit, the towns, the pro-life ordinances, the ACLU's arguments about rights violations, misleading information, designating providers as criminal, hampering operations, and the constitutional issues. Also, the response from the Right to Life group, who defend the ordinances as constitutional and say they're prepared to defend them.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with the lawsuit, mention the towns and the pro-life ordinances. Then, the ACLU's claims about violating rights, misleading, designating providers as criminal, which prohibits their operation. Highlight the constitutional argument. Then, mention the opposing side's defense, calling the lawsuit meritless and their intention to defend the ordinances without cost.

I need to make sure to include as many of the specified moral words as possible: violated, outlaw, misleads, assisting, designated, prohibited, hampered, unconstitutional, violates, brought, deter, intimidate, enacting, defend.

I'll craft the summary, ensuring it's concise and within 200 words. Let me check each sentence to include these terms appropriately. For example, "The ACLU argues that these ordinances violate the rights..." and so on.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown.

SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund, claims the ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," thereby prohibiting them from operating and assisting individuals seeking abortions. The ACLU contends that these measures hamper their ability to clarify confusion and violate the First Amendment. The legal complaint argues that the ordinances are unconstitutional, as abortion remains legal nationwide. Meanwhile, Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas defends the ordinances, calling the lawsuit meritless and aimed at deterring cities from enacting such laws. He vows to defend the ordinances at no cost to taxpayers. END OF SUMMARY.
