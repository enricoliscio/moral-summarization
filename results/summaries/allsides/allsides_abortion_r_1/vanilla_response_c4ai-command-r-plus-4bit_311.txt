SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the free expression and association rights of pro-abortion groups. The ACLU contends that the cities' ordinances, which aim to outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, have misled residents about the legality of abortion and designated abortion providers as "criminal organizations." The lawsuit argues that this hampers pro-abortion groups from operating and providing clarity on abortion access. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas, asserts that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. Meanwhile, Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, defends the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law, pledging to provide legal defense for the cities at no charge.
END OF SUMMARY.
