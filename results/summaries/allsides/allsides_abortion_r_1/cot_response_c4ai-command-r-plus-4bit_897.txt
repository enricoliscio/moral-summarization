SUMMARY: 
The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for the unborn, in their latest pro-abortion litigation effort. The ACLU argues that the pro-life ordinances of these cities violate the free expression and association rights of pro-abortion groups, the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund. The ordinances in question aim to outlaw abortion within city limits and designate abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations." The ACLU contends that this hampers the ability of pro-abortion organizations to operate, speak, and associate within these cities, infringing on their First Amendment rights. Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, has dismissed the ACLU's complaint as a meritless attempt to deter cities from enacting such ordinances. He has vowed to defend the ordinances and any other cities that may face similar legal challenges. 
END OF SUMMARY.
