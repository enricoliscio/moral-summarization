Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the ACLU filing a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. They're doing this on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, the Lilith Fund and the TEA Fund. The lawsuit claims that the towns' ordinances violate their rights to free expression and association.

The ordinances in question were passed by cities like Waskom, Naples, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Gary, and Wells. These ordinances would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The ACLU argues that this misleads residents about their right to access abortion. They also say the ordinances label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," which stops them from operating and clarifying the situation.

Anjali Salvador from the ACLU says these ordinances are unconstitutional because abortion is legal everywhere, and cities can't punish pro-abortion groups for their work, especially when it involves First Amendment rights.

On the other side, Mark Dickson from Right to Life East Texas supports these ordinances. He's been pushing for similar laws across Texas, saying every city is valuable. He dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and said they have a legal team ready to defend the towns without charging them.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the ACLU suing the towns, the pro-abortion groups involved, the nature of the ordinances, the ACLU's arguments, and the opposing viewpoint from Dickson. I should keep it concise, ensuring all key points are covered without extra details.

Let me structure it: Start with the lawsuit, the towns, the pro-life ordinances. Then explain the ACLU's claims about misleading residents and labeling providers as criminals. Mention Salvador's statement. Then counter with Dickson's support and his dismissal of the lawsuit. Conclude with the ongoing legal battle.

I need to make sure it's clear, concise, and within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I draft.
