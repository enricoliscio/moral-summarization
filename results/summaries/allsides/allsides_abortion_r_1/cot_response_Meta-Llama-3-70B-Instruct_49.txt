SUMMARY:
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, argues that the towns' pro-life ordinances violate their rights to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, are deemed "unconstitutional" by the ACLU. The lawsuit claims that the towns' ordinances mislead residents and dub abortion providers as "criminal organizations," preventing them from operating and speaking within city limits. Pro-life advocates, however, argue that the ordinances are "entirely constitutional" and necessary to protect "unborn life." The ACLU's lawsuit is seen as a "meritless" attempt to intimidate cities from enacting similar ordinances. END OF SUMMARY.
