SUMMARY: In a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, seven East Texas towns are being challenged for declaring themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children and enacting ordinances that allegedly mislead residents about the legality of abortion and violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ACLU argues that by designating abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," the cities have prohibited these groups from operating and created confusion that they are hampered from countering. The lawsuit contends that the cities are violating the First Amendment and intimidating pro-abortion organizations. Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, defends the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law. He vows to defend the cities against what he calls a "meritless" lawsuit brought to deter and intimidate.

END OF SUMMARY.
