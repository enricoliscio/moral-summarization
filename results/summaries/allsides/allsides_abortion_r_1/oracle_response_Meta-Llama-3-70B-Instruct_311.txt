SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that their pro-life ordinances "mislead" residents about the legality of abortion. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, have "designated" abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," effectively "prohibiting" them from operating, speaking, and associating within these cities. This, the ACLU argues, "hamper[s]" their ability to "counter" or "clarify" the "confusion" created by the ordinances. The ACLU claims that these ordinances "violate" the First Amendment and are "unconstitutional." In contrast, proponents of the ordinances, such as Mark Dickson, believe they are "entirely constitutional" and necessary to "protect" unborn life. Dickson has vowed to "defend" these ordinances and help other cities "enact" similar laws, accusing the ACLU of trying to "deter" and "intimidate" cities from taking action.

END OF SUMMARY.
