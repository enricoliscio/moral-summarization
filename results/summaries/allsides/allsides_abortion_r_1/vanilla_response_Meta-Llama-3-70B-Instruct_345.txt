SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, argues that the towns' pro-life ordinances violate their rights to free expression and association. The ordinances, passed in June, outlaw abortion within city limits if the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade is ever overturned. The ACLU claims the ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," preventing them from operating and clarifying confusion. The ACLU argues that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. Pro-life advocates, however, claim the ordinances are constitutional and consistent with Texas law, and are prepared to defend them at no charge to the cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
