SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of pro-abortion groups. The ACLU claims that the ordinances, which seek to outlaw abortion altogether within city limits, mislead residents about the legality of abortion and hinder pro-abortion entities from providing access to abortion services. The lawsuit contends that the cities' designation of abortion providers and pro-abortion groups as "criminal organizations" violates their First Amendment rights. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas, asserts that abortion is legal across the country and that cities cannot infringe on the rights of pro-abortion organizations. Mark Dickson, a pro-life advocate, defends the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law, pledging to provide legal defense for the cities at no charge. This lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between pro-life and pro-choice advocates, with the ACLU taking a stance in support of abortion rights and against what it perceives as an unlawful restriction on free expression and association.
END OF SUMMARY.
