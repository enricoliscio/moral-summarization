SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that the pro-life ordinances mislead residents and violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, have dubbed abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating, speaking, and associating within the cities. The ACLU argues that these ordinances are unconstitutional and hamper the ability of pro-abortion groups to clarify the confusion created by the ordinances. In response, Mark Dickson, director of Right to Life East Texas, has derided the lawsuit as "meritless" and vowed to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities, accusing the ACLU of trying to deter and intimidate cities from enacting these laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
