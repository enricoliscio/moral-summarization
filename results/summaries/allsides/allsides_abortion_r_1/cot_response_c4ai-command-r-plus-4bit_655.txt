SUMMARY: 
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for the unborn, in favor of pro-abortion groups' right to free expression and association. The ACLU argues that the pro-life ordinances of these cities violate the rights of abortion providers and pro-abortion entities by designating them as "criminal organizations." The lawsuit contends that this prevents them from operating, speaking, and associating within these cities, hindering their ability to provide abortion services. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, stated that abortion is legal across the country and cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for their work, especially when it violates the First Amendment. Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, called the ACLU's lawsuit meritless and said that they have a legal team ready to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities. The lawsuit is the latest in the ongoing debate between pro-abortion and pro-life groups, with the ACLU taking a stand for abortion rights and the cities enacting ordinances to protect the unborn.
