SUMMARY:
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, outlawing abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The ACLU argues that these pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of two pro-abortion groups, the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund (TEA Fund). The lawsuit claims that the ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and dub abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate and clarify the confusion. The ACLU asserts that these ordinances are "unconstitutional" and that cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for their "important work." In contrast, pro-life advocates, such as Mark Dickson, believe the ordinances are "entirely constitutional" and are prepared to defend them at no charge to the cities.
END OF SUMMARY.
