Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the ACLU suing East Texas towns over pro-life ordinances. They provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included. 

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. The ACLU is suing these towns for declaring themselves sanctuary cities for unborn children. The lawsuit claims the ordinances violate rights, mislead residents, and prohibit abortion services. The towns, on the other hand, argue that their laws are constitutional and are protecting life.

Next, I need to identify the key elements: who is involved (ACLU, Lilith Fund, TEA Fund, East Texas towns, Mark Dickson), the actions taken (filed lawsuit, designated criminal organizations, ordinances passed), and the moral language used. 

I should make sure to include as many of the specified moral words as possible without making the summary too long. Words like "violated," "outlaw," "misleads," "prohibited," "unconstitutional," etc., are crucial for maintaining the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to first state the lawsuit, then the claims from both sides, and conclude with the ongoing debate. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns for declaring themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming their pro-life ordinances violate rights to free expression and association. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of pro-abortion groups, argues the ordinances mislead residents about abortion's legality and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating and hampering their ability to assist individuals seeking abortions. The ACLU contends the ordinances are unconstitutional, as abortion remains legal nationwide. Mark Dickson, a pro-life advocate, dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, asserting the ordinances are constitutional and aimed at protecting unborn life. He also offered to defend the towns at no cost. The debate highlights ongoing tensions over abortion access and legal protections for unborn children. END OF SUMMARY.
