SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and violate the First Amendment. The ordinances, passed by cities such as Waskom, Naples, and Joaquin, contain language that would outlaw abortion altogether within city limits if Roe v. Wade is ever overturned. The ACLU claims that these ordinances prohibit pro-abortion groups from operating, speaking, and associating within these cities, hampering their ability to clarify the confusion created by the ordinances. The lawsuit contends that the cities' ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association, and that designating abortion providers as "criminal organizations" is unconstitutional. In response, Mark Dickson, director of Right to Life East Texas, has vowed to defend these ordinances, calling the lawsuit "meritless" and an attempt to deter and intimidate cities from enacting these laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
