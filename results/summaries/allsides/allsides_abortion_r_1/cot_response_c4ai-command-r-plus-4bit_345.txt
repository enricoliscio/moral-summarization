SUMMARY: 
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for the unborn, in favor of pro-abortion groups' rights to free expression and association. The ACLU argues that the pro-life ordinances of these towns violate the rights of abortion providers and pro-abortion entities, designating them as "criminal organizations." The lawsuit contends that this prevents them from operating, speaking, and associating within these cities, hindering their ability to provide abortion services. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, asserts that abortion is legal nationwide and cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for their work, especially when it violates the First Amendment. Mark Dickson, a prominent figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, defends the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law. He vows to provide legal defense for the towns and any other cities that enact similar laws. The lawsuit is seen as an attempt to deter and intimidate cities from protecting unborn life.
END OF SUMMARY.
