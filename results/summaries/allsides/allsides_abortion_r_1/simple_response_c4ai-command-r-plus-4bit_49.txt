SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of pro-abortion groups. The ACLU argues that the ordinances, which aim to outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, mislead residents about the legality of abortion and hinder pro-abortion entities from providing clarification and assistance. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, asserts that the ordinances are unconstitutional and infringe on the First Amendment rights of pro-abortion organizations. Mark Dickson, a pro-life advocate, defends the sanctuary cities, stating that the lawsuit is meritless and intended to intimidate, and pledges to provide legal defense for the cities at no charge. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between pro-life and pro-choice advocates, with the ACLU taking a stance against the protection of unborn life and in favor of abortion access and free expression. 

END OF SUMMARY.
