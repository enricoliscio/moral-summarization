Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user has specified that I should return the summary after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, the summary should be under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The ACLU is suing seven East Texas towns that declared themselves sanctuary cities for unborn children. The lawsuit is on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, claiming their rights are violated. The ordinances in these cities would ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, which the ACLU says misleads residents. They also argue that the cities label abortion providers as criminal organizations, hindering their operations.

I should include the key players: ACLU, the two pro-abortion groups, the seven cities, and the opposing side, Right to Life East Texas. Mark Dickson is their director, and he's defending the ordinances as constitutional. He's offering free legal defense to the cities.

I need to make sure the summary is concise. I'll mention the lawsuit, the reason behind it, the ordinances' content, the ACLU's arguments, and the opposing stance. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too detailed.

Now, putting it all together in a clear and concise manner. Start with the ACLU filing the lawsuit, the cities involved, the reason for the lawsuit, the content of the ordinances, the ACLU's arguments about misleading information and restrictions on providers, and the opposing side's defense. 

I should ensure that each sentence is clear and that the summary flows logically. Avoiding any jargon and keeping the language straightforward will make it accessible. Also, making sure to include all the key points without exceeding the word limit.

Finally, I'll structure it so that each main point is covered in a sentence or two, ensuring the summary is comprehensive yet brief. That should meet the user's requirements effectively.

SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund, claims the ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate. The ACLU argues that these measures are unconstitutional and infringe on free expression and association. Meanwhile, Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas defended the ordinances, calling the lawsuit meritless and offering free legal defense to the cities. The legal battle highlights ongoing tensions over abortion access and local governance in Texas. END OF SUMMARY.
