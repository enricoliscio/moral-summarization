Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and specific instructions on how to approach it. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. They want me to perform two main steps: identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a summary preserving those words. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and follow specific formatting with tokens.

Looking at the article, it's about the ACLU suing East Texas towns over their "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The article discusses the legal actions, the groups involved, their arguments, and the responses from both sides. The moral framing is evident in terms like "pro-abortion," "pro-life," "criminal organizations," "unconstitutional," and others that carry strong ethical connotations.

For Step 1, I need to extract each morally framed word. I'll go through the article and pick out words that have a clear moral or ethical implication. These include "pro-abortion," "sanctuary," "unborn," "violated," "criminal organizations," "unconstitutional," "intimidate," "valuable," and "consistent." Each of these words carries a specific moral weight in the context of the article.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll start by identifying the key points: the ACLU suing the towns, the groups involved, the arguments about free expression and association, the ordinances' impact, the ACLU's stance on the constitutionality, and the opposing views from the pro-life side. I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the moral terms without making it too lengthy.

I also need to ensure that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning the lawsuit, the plaintiffs, the ordinances' provisions, the ACLU's arguments, the pro-life response, and the legal teams involved. I'll make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate to preserve the original framing.

Finally, I'll format the response with the tokens as specified, starting with STEP 1, listing each moral word, then the SUMMARY section, and ending with END OF SUMMARY. I'll double-check to ensure all instructions are followed and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral perspective.

**STEP 1:**

* pro-abortion  
* sanctuary  
* unborn  
* violated  
* criminal organizations  
* unconstitutional  
* intimidate  
* valuable  
* consistent  

**SUMMARY:**  

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that the pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of pro-abortion groups. The lawsuit claims the ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate and clarify confusion. The ACLU argues the ordinances are unconstitutional, stating abortion is legal nationwide and cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations. Pro-life advocates, led by Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas, defend the ordinances as constitutional and necessary to protect unborn life, dismissing the lawsuit as meritless and aimed at intimidating cities. Dickson also offered free legal defense for the cities.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
