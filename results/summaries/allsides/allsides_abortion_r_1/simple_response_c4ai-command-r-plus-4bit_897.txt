SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, in a despicable attempt to infringe upon the rights of these cities to protect life. The ACLU, representing the heinous pro-abortion groups Lilith Fund and Texas Equal Access Fund, argues that their rights to free expression and association are being violated by the pro-life ordinances. The lawsuit claims that the ordinances, which aim to outlaw abortion within city limits and rightly designate abortion providers as criminal organizations, hamper the ability of pro-abortion entities to confuse and mislead residents regarding their so-called "right" to abortion. Anjali Salvador of the ACLU of Texas shamefully defends abortion as a legal right, disregarding the fundamental human right to life. Thankfully, Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas has courageously led the unborn sanctuary movement, recognizing the failure of legislators to protect unborn lives. Dickson rightfully dismisses the ACLU's lawsuit as a baseless attempt to intimidate cities from enacting moral and constitutional laws. He assures these cities that a legal team stands ready to defend these noble ordinances at no cost to taxpayers. It is appalling that the ACLU and pro-abortion groups would go to such lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn children, and it is essential that the brave efforts of Dickson and the sanctuary cities be supported and upheld.
END OF SUMMARY.
