SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of pro-abortion groups. The ACLU contends that the cities' ordinances, which outlaw abortion within city limits and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hamper the ability of pro-abortion entities to operate and provide clarification on abortion access. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas, stated that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. Meanwhile, Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, defended the cities' ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law, pledging to provide legal defense for the cities at no charge. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of pro-abortion litigation efforts by the ACLU.
END OF SUMMARY.
