SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of pro-abortion groups. The lawsuit contends that the ordinances, which aim to outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, mislead residents about the legality of abortion and hinder pro-abortion entities from providing assistance and clearing up confusion. The ACLU of Texas claims that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. In response, Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, has defended the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law. He has also stated that a legal team is ready to defend the cities against the ACLU's "meritless" lawsuit.
END OF SUMMARY.
