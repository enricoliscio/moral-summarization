SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of pro-abortion groups. The ACLU argues that the ordinances, which seek to outlaw abortion within city limits, mislead residents about the legality of abortion and hinder pro-abortion entities from providing assistance and clearing up confusion. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas, asserts that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment by targeting pro-abortion organizations. On the other hand, Mark Dickson, the director of Right to Life East Texas, defends the sanctuary cities' ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas laws. He characterizes the ACLU's lawsuit as an intimidation tactic and stands ready to defend the pro-life measures without cost to the cities or taxpayers. This dispute underscores the ongoing tension between pro-life and pro-choice advocates, with the ACLU taking legal action to challenge the efforts of the sanctuary cities to protect unborn life.
END OF SUMMARY.
