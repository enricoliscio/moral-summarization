SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of pro-abortion groups. The ACLU's lawsuit contends that the ordinances, which seek to outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, mislead residents about the legality of abortion and hinder pro-abortion entities from providing assistance and clearing up confusion. The lawsuit argues that designating abortion providers as "criminal organizations" prevents them from operating and associating within these cities, violating their First Amendment rights. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, asserts that abortion is legal nationwide and cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for their work. Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, has dismissed the ACLU's complaint as a meritless attempt to intimidate cities, stating that the ordinances are constitutional and that a legal team is ready to defend them at no cost to taxpayers.
END OF SUMMARY.
