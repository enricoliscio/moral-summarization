SUMMARY:
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of two pro-abortion groups. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion altogether within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, are deemed "unconstitutional" by the ACLU. The lawsuit argues that the ordinances mislead residents and dub abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate and clarify the legality of abortion services. Pro-life advocates, such as Mark Dickson, director of Right to Life East Texas, have vowed to defend the ordinances, calling the lawsuit "meritless" and aimed at intimidating cities from enacting similar laws. END OF SUMMARY.
