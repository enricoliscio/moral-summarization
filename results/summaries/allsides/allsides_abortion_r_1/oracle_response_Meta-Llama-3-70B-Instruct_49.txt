SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating, speaking, and associating within city limits. This, the ACLU claims, hampers their ability to counter and clarify the confusion created by the ordinances. The lawsuit contends that these ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. In response, pro-life advocates, such as Mark Dickson, have dismissed the lawsuit as "meritless" and vowed to defend the ordinances, which they believe protect unborn life and are consistent with Texas law.

END OF SUMMARY.
