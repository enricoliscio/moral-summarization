SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of two pro-abortion groups. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, have been deemed "unconstitutional" by the ACLU, which argues that cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their work. However, pro-life advocates, such as Mark Dickson, director of Right to Life East Texas, believe the ordinances are constitutional and consistent with Texas law. Dickson has vowed to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities, emphasizing the importance of protecting unborn life. The lawsuit is seen as an attempt to intimidate cities from enacting similar ordinances, but pro-life advocates remain resolute in their mission to safeguard the rights of the unborn.

END OF SUMMARY.
