SUMMARY:
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, claims that the towns' pro-life ordinances violate their rights to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, have dubbed abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations." The ACLU argues that this designation is unconstitutional and hampers the groups' ability to operate and provide abortion services. Pro-life advocates, however, see the ordinances as a necessary step to protect unborn life and are prepared to defend them in court. The lawsuit is seen as an attempt to intimidate cities from enacting similar ordinances. END OF SUMMARY.
