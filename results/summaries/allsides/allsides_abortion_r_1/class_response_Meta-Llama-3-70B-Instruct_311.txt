SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, violating the rights of two pro-abortion groups. The lawsuit argues that the towns' ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, mislead residents about their right to access abortion. The ordinances also designate abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating, speaking, and associating within the cities. This, the ACLU claims, hampers their ability to clarify the confusion created by the ordinances. The ACLU asserts that these ordinances are unconstitutional, violating the First Amendment, and are an attempt to punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their work. In response, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, Mark Dickson, has derided the lawsuit as "meritless" and vowed to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
