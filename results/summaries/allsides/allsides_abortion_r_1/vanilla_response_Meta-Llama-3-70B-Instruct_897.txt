SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, argues that the towns' pro-life ordinances violate the groups' rights to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, have been deemed unconstitutional by the ACLU. The lawsuit claims that the ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," preventing them from operating and speaking within the cities. The ACLU argues that cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their work. However, the director of Right to Life East Texas, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, has dismissed the lawsuit as "meritless" and vowed to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
