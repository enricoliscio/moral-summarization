SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, argues that the towns' pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association. The ordinances, which were passed in response to the possibility of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, would outlaw abortion within city limits. The ACLU claims that the ordinances mislead residents and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating and speaking within the cities. The ACLU argues that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. Pro-life advocates, however, believe the ordinances are constitutional and consistent with Texas law. They have offered to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities.
