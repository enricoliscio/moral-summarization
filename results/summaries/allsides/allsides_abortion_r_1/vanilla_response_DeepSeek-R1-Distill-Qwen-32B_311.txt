Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the ACLU filing a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. These towns have passed ordinances that, if Roe v. Wade is overturned, would outlaw abortion. The ACLU is suing on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, claiming their rights to free expression and association are violated.

Hmm, the key points here are the ACLU's lawsuit, the towns' ordinances, the potential impact if Roe is overturned, and the argument about misleading residents. Also, the ACLU argues that designating abortion providers as criminal organizations restricts their operations. The pro-life side, led by Mark Dickson, believes the lawsuit is meritless and intends to defend the ordinances without charging the cities.

I should structure the summary to include the lawsuit details, the towns involved, the main arguments from both sides, and the implications. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but cover all essential aspects. Let me make sure I include the ACLU's stance, the towns' response, and the broader context of the abortion debate.

Wait, the article mentions that the ordinances would outlaw abortion if Roe is overturned. That's a crucial point because it shows the towns are preparing for a potential future where abortion isn't legal. Also, the ACLU argues that this misleads residents about their rights, which is a significant legal argument.

On the pro-life side, Dickson is confident the ordinances are constitutional and that they have a legal team ready to defend them without cost. This shows the pro-life movement's determination to protect these laws.

I think I've got all the main points. Now, I'll condense this into a coherent summary, making sure to include the lawsuit, the towns, the legal arguments, and the opposing viewpoints. I'll also keep an eye on the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing their pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups. The ordinances, passed by Waskom, Naples, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Gary, and Wells, aim to outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, which the ACLU claims misleads residents about their rights. The lawsuit alleges the ordinances label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," restricting their ability to operate and clarify the legality of abortion services. The ACLU contends the ordinances are unconstitutional, as abortion remains legal nationwide, and cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations. Pro-life advocate Mark Dickson, director of Right to Life East Texas, dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating the ordinances are constitutional and his team is ready to defend them at no cost to the cities. END OF SUMMARY.
