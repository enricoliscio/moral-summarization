Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The ACLU filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves sanctuary cities for unborn children. The lawsuit was on behalf of pro-abortion groups, arguing that the towns' ordinances violate their rights to free expression and association. The ordinances would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, which the ACLU says misleads residents. They also claim the ordinances label abortion providers as criminal, hindering their ability to operate. The ACLU argues the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. On the other side, Mark Dickson supports the ordinances, calling the lawsuit meritless and intending to defend them without cost to the cities.

Now, I need to craft a summary using the moral terms. I'll start by stating the ACLU's action, using "filed a lawsuit" and "on behalf of." Then, mention the ordinances' effect, using "outlaw abortion" and "misleads residents." Next, note the ACLU's contention about the ordinances designating providers as criminal, hampering their work. Include Salvador's statement on unconstitutionality and First Amendment violation. Finally, mention Dickson's defense, using "enacting," "defend," and "meritless lawsuit." I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many moral terms as possible without making it too long.

SUMMARY:  
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, are accused of misleading residents about the legality of abortion services. The ACLU contends that the cities' designations of abortion providers as "criminal organizations" prohibit these groups from operating, speaking, and associating within the cities, thereby hampering their ability to clarify confusion. The lawsuit claims the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. Mark Dickson, a pro-life advocate, dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, stating that the ordinances are constitutional and intended to protect unborn life. He also offered to defend the cities at no cost. The ACLU's complaint aims to deter and intimidate cities from enacting such ordinances, while Dickson vows to defend them as part of a broader effort to protect unborn life across Texas.  
END OF SUMMARY.
