Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the ACLU suing some Texas towns over their "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

Okay, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns. These towns declared themselves sanctuary cities for unborn children, which probably means they have ordinances restricting abortion. The lawsuit is on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, Lilith Fund and TEA Fund. They're arguing that their rights to free expression and association are being violated by these pro-life ordinances.

The first ordinance was passed by Waskom in June, and others followed in Naples, Joaquin, Tenaha, Rusk, Gary, and Wells. The ACLU's complaint says these ordinances would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, which misleads residents about their right to access abortion. They also mention that the ordinances label abortion providers as criminal organizations, which stops them from helping people get abortions and clarifying the situation.

The lawsuit claims this is unconstitutional because abortion is legal everywhere, and cities can't punish pro-abortion groups for their work, especially if it violates the First Amendment. Anjali Salvador from the ACLU made that point.

On the other side, Mark Dickson from Right to Life East Texas supports these ordinances. He thinks the lawsuit is meritless and meant to intimidate cities from enacting such laws. He also mentioned they have a legal team ready to defend these ordinances without charging the cities.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the ACLU suing the towns, the reason being violation of free expression, the specific ordinances, the argument about misleading residents, the labeling as criminal organizations, the ACLU's stance on it being unconstitutional, and the opposing view from Dickson and their defense readiness.

I should structure it to first state the lawsuit, then the towns involved, the nature of the ordinances, the ACLU's arguments, the opposition's response, and the significance of the case.

Let me check the word count as I draft to make sure it's concise.

SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing the pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The lawsuit, on behalf of Lilith Fund and Texas Equal Access Fund, claims the ordinances mislead residents about abortion access and label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate. The ACLU argues the ordinances are unconstitutional, as abortion remains legal nationwide. Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas supports the ordinances, calling the lawsuit meritless and intended to intimidate cities. He stated his organization is prepared to defend the laws at no cost. END OF SUMMARY.
