SUMMARY:
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, claiming that their pro-abortion rights to free expression and association are being violated. The towns' pro-life ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, are deemed "unconstitutional" by the ACLU. The lawsuit argues that the ordinances mislead residents and dub abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate and assist people with aborting their unborn children. The ACLU claims that cities cannot punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their "important work." In contrast, the director of Right to Life East Texas, Mark Dickson, believes the ordinances are "entirely constitutional" and is prepared to defend them at no charge to the cities. The ACLU's lawsuit is seen as a "meritless" attempt to "intimidate" cities from enacting these ordinances. END OF SUMMARY.
