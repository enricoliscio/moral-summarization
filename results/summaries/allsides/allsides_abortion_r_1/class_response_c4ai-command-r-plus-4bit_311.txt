SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, alleging that the cities have violated the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ACLU argues that the cities' ordinances, which seek to outlaw abortion and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," mislead residents about the legality of abortion and prohibit pro-abortion entities from operating within city limits. The lawsuit contends that the ordinances are unconstitutional and hamper the ability of pro-abortion groups to assist people seeking abortions. The ACLU asserts that the cities cannot deter and intimidate pro-abortion organizations from exercising their First Amendment rights by enacting such laws. Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, has defended the cities' ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law. He has vowed to defend the cities against the ACLU's lawsuit, which he considers meritless.
END OF SUMMARY.
