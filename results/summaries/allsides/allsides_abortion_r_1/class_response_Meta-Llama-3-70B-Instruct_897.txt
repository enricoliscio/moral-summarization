SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, violating the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The lawsuit argues that the towns' ordinances, which outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, mislead residents about the legality of abortion services. The ordinances also designate abortion providers and pro-abortion entities as "criminal organizations," prohibiting them from operating, speaking, and associating within the cities. This, the ACLU claims, hampers their ability to counter or clarify the confusion created by the ordinances. The ACLU asserts that these ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. In response, the director of Right to Life East Texas, Mark Dickson, has dismissed the lawsuit as "meritless" and has offered to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
