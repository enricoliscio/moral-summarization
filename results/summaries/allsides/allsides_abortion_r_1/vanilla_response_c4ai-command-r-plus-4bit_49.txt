SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the free expression and association rights of pro-abortion groups. The ACLU contends that the ordinances, which seek to outlaw abortion within city limits, mislead residents about the legality of abortion and hinder pro-abortion organizations from providing assistance and clarification to those seeking abortions. Anjali Salvador, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, asserts that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. In response, Mark Dickson, the director of Right to Life East Texas, defends the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law, pledging to provide legal defense for the cities at no charge. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of pro-abortion litigation efforts by the ACLU, highlighting the ongoing tension between pro-life and pro-choice advocates in the state of Texas.
END OF SUMMARY.
