SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, argues that the towns' pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association. The ordinances, which aim to outlaw abortion within city limits if Roe v. Wade is overturned, allegedly mislead residents about their right to access abortion and label abortion providers as "criminal organizations." The ACLU claims this prevents pro-abortion entities from operating and clarifying the legality of abortion services. The director of Right to Life East Texas, Mark Dickson, has dismissed the lawsuit as "meritless" and promised to defend the ordinances at no charge to the cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
