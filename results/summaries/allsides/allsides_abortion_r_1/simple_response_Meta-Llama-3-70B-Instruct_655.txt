SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, effectively outlawing abortion within city limits. The ACLU argues that the pro-life ordinances violate the rights to free expression and association of two pro-abortion groups, the Lilith Fund and the Texas Equal Access Fund (TEA Fund). The lawsuit claims that the ordinances mislead residents about the legality of abortion and dub abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate and clarify the confusion. The ACLU asserts that these ordinances are unconstitutional and punish pro-abortion organizations for carrying out their work. In contrast, pro-life advocates, such as Mark Dickson, believe the ordinances are constitutional and consistent with Texas laws, and are prepared to defend them at no charge to the cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
