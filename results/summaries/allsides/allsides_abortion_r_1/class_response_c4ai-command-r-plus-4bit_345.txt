SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns, alleging that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ACLU claims that the ordinances, which seek to outlaw abortion and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," mislead residents and hamper pro-abortion groups from assisting those seeking abortions. The ACLU argues that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. The director of Right to Life East Texas, Mark Dickson, has defended the ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law, calling the ACLU's lawsuit meritless and intended to intimidate cities from enacting pro-life measures. He has vowed to defend the cities against the lawsuit at no charge to taxpayers.

END OF SUMMARY.
