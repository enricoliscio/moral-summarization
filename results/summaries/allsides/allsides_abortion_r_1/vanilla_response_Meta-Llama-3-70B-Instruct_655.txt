SUMMARY:

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, argues that the towns' pro-life ordinances violate the groups' rights to free expression and association. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, allegedly mislead residents about their right to access abortion and dub abortion providers as "criminal organizations." The ACLU claims that this prevents the groups from operating, speaking, and associating within the cities. The lawsuit contends that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. However, proponents of the ordinances argue that they are constitutional and consistent with Texas law, and are prepared to defend them at no cost to the cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
