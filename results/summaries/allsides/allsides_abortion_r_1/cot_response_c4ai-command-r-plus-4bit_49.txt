SUMMARY: 
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for the unborn. The ACLU argues that the pro-life ordinances passed by these cities violate the free expression and association rights of pro-abortion groups. The lawsuit contends that the ordinances criminalize abortion providers and pro-abortion entities, preventing them from operating and providing clarification on abortion access. Anjali Salvador of the ACLU of Texas stated that the ordinances are "unconstitutional" and that "abortion is legal in every state and city." The lawsuit is a response to the efforts of Mark Dickson, who has led the movement to establish unborn sanctuaries in Texas. Dickson has criticized the ACLU's lawsuit as meritless and intends to defend the ordinances, which he believes are consistent with Texas law. The lawsuit and the sanctuary movement reflect the ongoing debate and legal battles surrounding abortion rights in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
