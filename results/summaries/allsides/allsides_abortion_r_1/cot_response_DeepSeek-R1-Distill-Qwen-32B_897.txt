Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The article is about the ACLU filing a lawsuit against East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The lawsuit is on behalf of two pro-abortion groups, arguing that the towns' ordinances violate their rights to free expression and association. The ordinances would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, which the ACLU says misleads residents. They also claim the ordinances label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," preventing them from operating.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation related to the moral aspects of the issue. Words like "pro-abortion," "sanctuary cities," "unborn children," "misleads," "criminal organizations," "important work," "First Amendment," "constitutional," "deter," "intimidate," and "protecting unborn life" all carry moral weight. I'll list these out.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these morally charged words as possible. I'll start by stating the ACLU's action, mention the towns and the pro-abortion groups involved. I'll explain the ordinances' effect on abortion if Roe is overturned and the ACLU's argument about misleading residents. I'll include the part about labeling providers as criminal, affecting their ability to operate. Then, I'll mention the ACLU's stance on the unconstitutionality and the First Amendment. I'll also include the opposing viewpoint from Mark Dickson, the director of Right to Life East Texas, who supports the ordinances and criticizes the lawsuit as meritless and intimidating. Finally, I'll note his offer to defend the towns for free.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all main points without being too detailed. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to reflect the article's perspective accurately. Let me put this together concisely.

**SUMMARY:**
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing that their pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups. The ordinances, which would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, are accused of misleading residents and labeling abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate. The ACLU contends that these measures are unconstitutional and infringe on First Amendment rights. Meanwhile, Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas defends the ordinances, calling the lawsuit meritless and intended to intimidate cities from protecting unborn life. Dickson offers free legal defense for the towns. The dispute highlights conflicting moral and legal perspectives on abortion access and fetal protection.
