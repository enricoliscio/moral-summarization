Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user has provided a specific query where they want the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also specified that the summary should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the ACLU filing a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children. The ACLU is representing pro-abortion groups, arguing that the towns' ordinances violate their rights to free expression and association. The ordinances would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, which the ACLU claims misleads residents. They also mention that the ordinances label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their operations.

On the other side, Mark Dickson from Right to Life East Texas supports the ordinances, calling the lawsuit meritless and stating they have a legal team ready to defend the towns without cost.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll focus on the key elements: who filed the lawsuit, the towns involved, the ACLU's arguments, the content of the ordinances, the opposition's stance, and the legal implications. I'll make sure to include both perspectives to provide a balanced summary.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the ACLU filing the lawsuit, mention the towns, the pro-abortion groups involved, the main arguments about misleading residents and criminalizing providers. Then, include the opposing viewpoint from Dickson and his organization's stance. Keep each sentence clear and to the point to stay within the word limit.

I should avoid any jargon and keep the language straightforward. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, moving from the lawsuit details to the opposing arguments. Double-check the word count to make sure it doesn't exceed 200 words. 

Once the summary is drafted, I'll review it to ensure it captures all essential points without unnecessary details. Make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, arguing the pro-life ordinances violate the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ordinances, passed by cities like Waskom, Naples, and others, would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, misleading residents about abortion's legality. The ACLU claims the ordinances label abortion providers as "criminal organizations," hindering their ability to operate and clarify confusion. Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas defended the ordinances, calling the lawsuit meritless and stating his organization is ready to defend the towns at no cost. The lawsuit argues the ordinances are unconstitutional, as abortion is legal nationwide, and cities cannot penalize pro-abortion organizations for their work. END OF SUMMARY.
