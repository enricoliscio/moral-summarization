SUMMARY: The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against seven East Texas towns that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" for unborn children, alleging that the cities have violated the rights of pro-abortion groups to free expression and association. The ACLU argues that the cities' ordinances, which seek to outlaw abortion and designate abortion providers as "criminal organizations," mislead residents and hamper pro-abortion groups from assisting people seeking abortions. The ACLU contends that the ordinances are unconstitutional and violate the First Amendment. Mark Dickson, a leading figure in the unborn sanctuary movement, has defended the cities' ordinances as constitutional and consistent with Texas law. He has also criticized the ACLU's lawsuit as meritless and intended to deter and intimidate cities from enacting such laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
