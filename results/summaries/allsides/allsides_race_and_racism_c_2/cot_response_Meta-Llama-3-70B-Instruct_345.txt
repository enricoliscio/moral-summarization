SUMMARY:
President Trump unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The garden aims to preserve the memory of American heroes and stir a spirit of responsibility in citizens. The order also addresses the current calls to topple Confederate statues, underscoring that destroying monuments is to desecrate our common inheritance. Trump railed against the "far-left fascism" that demands absolute allegiance and seeks to overthrow the American Revolution, destroying the very civilization that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement. The garden is set to open prior to July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. END OF SUMMARY.
