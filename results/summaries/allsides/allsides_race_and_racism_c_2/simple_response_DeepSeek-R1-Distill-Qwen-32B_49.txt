Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump announcing an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes." This garden will feature statues of prominent Americans. He announced this during the Fourth of July at Mount Rushmore. The timing is interesting because the country is dealing with calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography. 

The executive order mentions that these statues are "silent teachers" preserving the American story and inspiring responsibility for the future. It also sets up a task force to handle the funding and location of the garden. The statues include a list of notable figures like Jefferson, Lincoln, MLK, Tubman, etc. The garden is supposed to be open by 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

Additionally, the order addresses the current movement to topple Confederate statues, arguing against destroying monuments as it's seen as desecrating the nation's heritage. Trump criticizes those who want to remove statues, calling it a form of far-left fascism that aims to overthrow the American Revolution and erase national heritage.

So, the moral framing here is about preserving history and heritage versus the movement to remove statues seen as symbols of racism. The executive order is presented as a positive step to honor heroes, while Trump is against the destruction of historical monuments, viewing it as an attack on the nation's identity.

I need to make sure the summary captures this tension: the creation of the garden as a celebration of heroes, the context of the current debates on statues, and Trump's stance against removing Confederate statues, framing it as a defense of heritage against a radical left movement.

I should also include key details like the list of statues, the task force, and the deadline for the garden's opening. Keeping it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all these elements without getting too wordy.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the announcement of the garden, mention the context of the current debates, include the task force and the list of statues, the opening date, and then address Trump's criticism of statue removal, tying it back to the moral argument about preserving heritage.

I should also make sure to highlight the contrast between honoring heroes and the opposing movement to remove statues, emphasizing the moral stance presented in the article.
