SUMMARY: The White House issued an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent Americans, amid ongoing debates about the removal of Confederate statues. The executive order emphasizes the educational and inspirational value of statues, referring to them as "silent teachers." It establishes a task force to oversee the project and sets a deadline for the garden to be opened by July 4, 2026. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman, among others. 

The executive order also addresses the recent calls to remove monuments of historical figures who owned slaves, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. President Trump strongly criticized these efforts during his speech at Mount Rushmore, equating them to a "left-wing cultural revolution" aimed at overthrowing American values and history. He characterized these actions as a desecration of America's common inheritance, which should be preserved for future generations.
