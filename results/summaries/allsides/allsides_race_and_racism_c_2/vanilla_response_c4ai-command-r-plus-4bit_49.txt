SUMMARY: President Trump unveiled an executive order on Friday to create a "National Garden of American Heroes," a site that will feature statues of prominent Americans. This announcement comes amid national debates over the removal of Confederate statues and other racist iconography. The executive order establishes a task force to identify potential locations and sources of funding for the garden, which is set to open by July 4, 2026. The garden will include statues of historical figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, and Harriet Tubman, among others. In his speech at Mount Rushmore, Trump criticized those who want to tear down Confederate statues, accusing them of attempting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and condemning "left-wing cultural revolution." He also emphasized the importance of preserving monuments as part of the nation's shared inheritance. The executive order addresses the controversy, stating that destroying monuments desecrates the country's common inheritance and history.
