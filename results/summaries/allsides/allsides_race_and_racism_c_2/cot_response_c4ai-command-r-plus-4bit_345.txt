SUMMARY: 
The White House issued an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes", featuring statues of prominent Americans. This comes amidst ongoing debates about removing Confederate statues and addressing racist iconography across the country. The executive order emphasizes the statues as teachers, preserving the memory and spirit of American history, and honoring the accomplishments and sacrifices of exceptional citizens. It establishes a task force to identify potential locations for the garden, which will include statues of notable figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman. The order also addresses recent calls to topple statues, including those of slave-owning founders like Washington and Jefferson, condemning such actions as desecration of our common inheritance. President Trump, in his speech at Mount Rushmore, passionately accused protesters of attempting to overthrow the American Revolution and impose a left-wing cultural fascism. He vowed to protect American heritage and history, condemning the destruction of monuments as an attack on our shared past and future. The executive order and Trump's speech reflect a moral framing of history, honoring service, virtues, and achievements while rejecting destructive acts of censorship and historical erasure.
