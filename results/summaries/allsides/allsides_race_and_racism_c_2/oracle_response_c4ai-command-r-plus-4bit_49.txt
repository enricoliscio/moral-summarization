SUMMARY: The White House announced an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes, featuring statues of prominent Americans. This order comes amidst nationwide debates about tearing down Confederate statues and addressing racist iconography. The executive order recognizes statues as teachers, preserving the memory and spirit of responsibility of our American story. It establishes a task force to propose options for the garden's creation, including potential locations. The garden will include statues of influential Americans such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman. 

The order also addresses the current movement to topple Confederate statues and monuments of slave-owning figures like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. It condemns the destruction of monuments as a desecration of our common inheritance. The order emphasizes that these statues belong to all generations and should not be discarded due to political passions. President Trump, in a speech at Mount Rushmore, accused those tearing down statues of wanting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. He characterized these actions as a left-wing cultural revolution, determined to tear down all symbols and memories of our national heritage. The National Garden of American Heroes aims to preserve the sacrifices and service of exceptional Americans, ensuring their memory endures for future generations.
