SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The move comes as the nation grapples with calls to remove Confederate statues and racist iconography. The order establishes a task force to create the garden, which will include statues of American heroes such as Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, and Harriet Tubman. The garden will be open by July 4, 2026. The order also condemns the destruction of monuments, stating that they belong to future generations and should not be discarded based on "fashionable political passions." President Trump has framed the issue as a battle against "far-left fascism" that seeks to "overthrow the American Revolution" and destroy the country's national heritage. He has accused those tearing down statues of wanting to fundamentally change the country and erase its history.
