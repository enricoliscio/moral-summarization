SUMMARY: The White House issued an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes," a site that will feature statues of prominent Americans, including Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Abraham Lincoln. This order comes amid a national debate over the presence of Confederate statues and other racist symbols in public spaces. The executive order emphasizes the importance of preserving the memory of American history and the sacrifices made by our fellow citizens. It also addresses the recent protests and calls to tear down monuments of historical figures who owned slaves, such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The order establishes a task force to identify potential locations for the garden, which is set to open by July 4, 2026. President Trump, in a speech at Mount Rushmore, strongly criticized the destruction and vandalization of statues, stating that these monuments are part of our common inheritance and should not be discarded. He denounced the "left-wing cultural revolution" that aims to overthrow the American Revolution and rewrite history. Trump emphasized the need to preserve our national heritage and the values of freedom and democracy it represents.
