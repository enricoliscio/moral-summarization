SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The order, announced by President Trump during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, comes as the nation grapples with calls to tear down Confederate statues. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. A task force will be established to submit a report on options for the garden's creation within 60 days. The order also addresses current calls to topple Confederate statues, emphasizing that monuments belong to generations past and future. Trump also railed against people tearing down statues, accusing them of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country.
