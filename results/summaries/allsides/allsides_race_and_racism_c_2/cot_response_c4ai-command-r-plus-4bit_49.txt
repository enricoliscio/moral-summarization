SUMMARY:
Amid calls for the removal of Confederate statues across the United States, President Trump unveiled an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes." The order, announced during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, emphasizes the moral significance of monuments as "silent teachers" preserving America's history and instilling a sense of responsibility. It condemns the destruction and vandalism of statues as desecration of a shared inheritance, accusing those who topple monuments of being inflamed by "fashionable political passions." The order also decries the rise of a "new far-left fascism" that seeks to overthrow the American Revolution and tear down symbols of national heritage. It establishes a task force to identify potential locations for the garden, which will feature statues of prominent Americans such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Abraham Lincoln, among others. The garden aims to honor American heroes and preserve their legacy for future generations, opening to the public before July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
