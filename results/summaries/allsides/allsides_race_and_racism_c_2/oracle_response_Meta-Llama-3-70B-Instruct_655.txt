SUMMARY:

President Trump has announced an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans, amidst calls to tear down Confederate statues across the country. The garden will preserve the memory of American heroes, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others. The executive order establishes a task force to submit a report on options for the garden's creation within 60 days. Trump emphasized that destroying monuments is to desecrate our common inheritance, and that these statues belong to generations past and future. He railed against the destruction of Confederate statues, accusing those responsible of wanting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. Trump warned that a left-wing cultural revolution seeks to destroy the very civilization that has lifted humanity to new heights of achievement and progress. The garden is set to open prior to July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
