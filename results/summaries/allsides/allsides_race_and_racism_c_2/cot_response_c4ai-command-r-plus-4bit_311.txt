SUMMARY: 
Amid calls to tear down Confederate statues, President Trump issued an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes". This garden will be a place where statues of prominent Americans will stand as "silent teachers", preserving the memory and spirit of our nation's history. The executive order emphasizes the moral responsibility of preserving these statues, condemning their destruction as a desecration of our common inheritance. It denounces the passionate and fashionable whims of those who would tear down monuments, calling it a form of censorship and persecution. The order also highlights the threat of a new far-left fascism that seeks to overthrow the American Revolution and the very foundations of our civilization. The garden, set to open by 2026, will showcase statues of American heroes such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman, among others. It will serve as a testament to the virtues and sacrifices of exceptional Americans, despite their flaws, and inspire future generations.
