SUMMARY: On Friday, July 3rd, President Trump announced an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" during his Fourth of July celebration speech at Mount Rushmore. This comes amidst nationwide debates about tearing down Confederate statues and addressing other racist symbols. The executive order establishes a task force to oversee the project and choose a site for the garden, which will feature statues of prominent Americans such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Abraham Lincoln. The garden aims to preserve the memory of exceptional Americans and their contributions to the nation. President Trump strongly criticized the destruction and removal of statues, calling it a "desecration of our common inheritance." He also accused activists of attempting to overthrow the American Revolution and impose a "new far-left fascism." The executive order underscores the importance of preserving historical monuments and plans to have the National Garden of American Heroes open by July 4, 2026, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
