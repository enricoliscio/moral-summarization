Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them step by step. First, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. Let me read through the text again to spot those words.

The article talks about the creation of the National Garden of American Heroes, which includes statues of prominent Americans. The executive order mentions that these statues are "silent teachers" and "preserve the memory" of the American story. They also "stir a spirit of responsibility" and "call forth gratitude." These words have a positive moral connotation.

Then, the order addresses the calls to tear down Confederate statues, describing it as "vandalized" or "destroyed" by "fashionable political passions." The president criticizes those actions, using terms like "desecrate," "discarded," and "left-wing cultural revolution." These words carry negative moral weight, implying that tearing down statues is wrong or destructive.

Next, the president's speech at Mount Rushmore is mentioned, where he accuses those who tear down statues of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and engage in "new far-left fascism." He warns against "censorship" and "persecution," which are strong moral terms indicating suppression and unfair treatment.

So, compiling all these, the morally framed words are: silent teachers, preserve, memory, spirit, responsibility, gratitude, desecrate, discarded, vandalized, destroyed, fashionable, passions, far-left, fascism, allegiance, censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, punished, cultural revolution, overthrown, civilization, rescued, poverty, disease, violence, hunger, achievement, discovery, progress, tear down, statues, symbols, memories, national heritage.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping these moral terms. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of these words as possible without losing the essence.

I'll start by stating the creation of the National Garden, highlighting the positive moral framing. Then, mention the criticism of removing Confederate statues, using the negative moral terms. Finally, include Trump's speech against the left-wing actions, emphasizing the preservation of heritage.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes the key points: the garden's purpose, the criticism of statue removal, and Trump's strong stance against it. I'll make sure to incorporate the identified moral words to preserve the author's framing.

Let me draft that. First, the garden's establishment, then the criticism, and Trump's speech. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. I think that covers all necessary points while preserving the moral language.

**SUMMARY:**  
The White House has unveiled an executive order to create the "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent Americans, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The order emphasizes that these statues are "silent teachers" preserving the "memory" of the American story and inspiring "gratitude" for the nation's heritage. It criticizes the recent calls to "tear down" Confederate statues, arguing that such actions "desecrate" the "common inheritance" of future generations. President Trump condemned the "left-wing cultural revolution" as an attempt to "overthrow the American Revolution" and destroy the "civilization" that has "rescued billions" from poverty and disease. The garden, set to open by July 4, 2026, aims to "preserve" the "memory" of American heroes while opposing the "vandalization" or "destruction" of historical symbols. The order underscores the importance of "national heritage" and warns against "fashionable political passions" that seek to "discard" the past. END OF SUMMARY.
