SUMMARY:
President Trump has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The garden is intended to preserve the memory of America's story and stir a spirit of responsibility in its citizens. The move comes as the nation grapples with calls to tear down Confederate statues and address racist iconography. Trump railed against those seeking to destroy monuments, calling it an attempt to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. He accused them of promoting a "far-left fascism" that demands absolute allegiance and seeks to destroy America's national heritage. The garden is set to open before July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. END OF SUMMARY.
