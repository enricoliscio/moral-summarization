SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The order, announced by President Trump during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, comes as the nation grapples with calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The executive order also addresses current calls to topple Confederate statues, emphasizing that monuments belong to generations past and future, not to be discarded at the whim of current passions. Trump also railed against people tearing down statues of Confederate leaders, accusing them of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country.
