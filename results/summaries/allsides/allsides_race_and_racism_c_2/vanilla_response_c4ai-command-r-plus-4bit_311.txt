SUMMARY: President Trump unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. This comes amid calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography across the country. The executive order establishes a task force to oversee the creation of the garden, which will include statues of historical figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others. The garden aims to preserve the memory of America's history and will be open by July 4, 2026. Trump's announcement at Mount Rushmore criticized those tearing down Confederate statues, accusing them of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and emphasized the importance of preserving America's heritage. He also condemned the "left-wing cultural revolution" and its attempts to dismantle monuments of historical figures. The executive order addresses the ongoing debate surrounding Confederate statues and highlights the destruction of monuments belonging to all generations of Americans.
