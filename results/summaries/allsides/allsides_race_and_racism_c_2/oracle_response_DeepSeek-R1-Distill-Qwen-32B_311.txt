Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's executive order creating a National Garden of American Heroes. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author used. They provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is announcing a new garden with statues of prominent Americans, aiming to counter the movement to remove Confederate statues. The executive order mentions preserving American heritage, the importance of statues as silent teachers, and criticizes the destruction of monuments as desecration. Trump also spoke against the left-wing cultural revolution, using strong language like "overthrow" and "fascism."

I need to make sure to include words like preserve, sacrifices, service, destroy, desecrate, protests, vandalized, etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the creation of the garden, its purpose, the criticism of removing statues, and Trump's rhetoric against the left. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear.

Let me start drafting: The White House introduced an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes with statues of notable figures. This move is in response to calls to remove Confederate statues. The order emphasizes preserving the American story and honoring sacrifices, while criticizing the destruction of monuments as desecration. Trump condemned the left-wing movement, calling it a cultural revolution aiming to overthrow American values. The garden is set to open by 2026, showcasing statues of various heroes, while addressing the debate over statues tied to slavery, like Washington and Jefferson. The summary needs to capture the tension between preserving heritage and the push to remove problematic symbols, using the specified moral terms.

I think that covers the main points and includes the necessary moral language. I'll make sure it's within the word limit and flows naturally.
