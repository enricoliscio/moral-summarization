Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump announcing an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes." He did this during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore. The garden will have statues of prominent Americans like John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and others. 

The article mentions that this comes at a time when there's a lot of discussion about removing Confederate statues and addressing racist symbols. Trump's order seems to be a response to that movement. The executive order establishes a task force to plan and build the garden, which is supposed to be ready by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

In the order, Trump argues against destroying statues, saying it's like desecrating the nation's heritage. He criticized those who want to remove statues, calling it a left-wing cultural revolution aimed at overthrowing the American Revolution. He also mentioned that some statues, like those of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, are under scrutiny despite not being Confederate figures.

The garden will have statues of various heroes, including some who were enslaved or fought for civil rights, like Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King Jr. It's interesting that the garden includes a mix of historical figures, some with controversial pasts, like Jefferson who owned slaves.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: the creation of the National Garden, the context of the current debate on statues, Trump's stance against removing statues, and the list of notable figures included. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and to the point.
