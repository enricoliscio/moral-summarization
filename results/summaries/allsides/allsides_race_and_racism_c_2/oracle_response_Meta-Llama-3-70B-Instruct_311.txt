SUMMARY:

President Trump has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans, amidst calls to tear down Confederate statues across the country. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others. The executive order emphasizes the importance of preserving the memory of our American story and stirring a spirit of responsibility for the chapters yet unwritten. It also addresses current calls to topple Confederate statues, underscoring that destroying monuments is to desecrate our common inheritance. Trump railed against people tearing down statues, accusing them of wanting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. He warned that this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to destroy our national heritage, and that they are determined to tear down every statue, symbol, and memory of it. The task force has 60 days to submit a report to the White House detailing options for the creation of the National Garden.
