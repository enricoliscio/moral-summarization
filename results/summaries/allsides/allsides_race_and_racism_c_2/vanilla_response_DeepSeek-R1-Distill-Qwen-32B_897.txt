Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the White House's new executive order. The article is quite detailed, so I'll start by identifying the main points. 

First, President Trump announced the creation of the National Garden of American Heroes, which includes statues of prominent Americans. This was during the Fourth of July at Mount Rushmore. The executive order mentions the task force and funding from the Interior Department, with a 60-day report deadline. The garden will include statues of notable figures like Jefferson, Lincoln, Tubman, etc., and also have a temporary display collection. It's supposed to be ready by July 4, 2026.

The article also touches on the current debate about Confederate statues and other monuments. The executive order addresses this by arguing against the removal of statues, stating they belong to all generations and that destroying them is desecrating history. Trump criticized the left-wing movement, calling it a cultural revolution aimed at overhauling the country.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the announcement, the purpose of the garden, the task force, the list of statues, and the opposition to removing other monuments. I should also include Trump's comments about cultural revolution and preserving history.

I'll structure it by first introducing the executive order, then the garden's details, followed by the response to the statue removal debates, and finally Trump's stance. I'll make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.
