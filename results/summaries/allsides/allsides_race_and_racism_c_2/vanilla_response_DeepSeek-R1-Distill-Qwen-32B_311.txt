Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Trump announcing an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes. It mentions the unveiling at Mount Rushmore during the Fourth of July celebration. The garden will have statues of prominent Americans like John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and others. 

Hmm, I need to note that this comes during a time when there's a lot of debate about Confederate statues and other racist symbols. The executive order also addresses that, saying that destroying monuments is wrong and that these statues belong to all generations. Trump criticized those tearing down statues, calling it a left-wing cultural revolution trying to overthrow the American Revolution.

I should keep the summary under 200 words. Let me make sure to include the key points: the creation of the garden, the list of statues, the 2026 deadline, and the context of the current debates about Confederate statues. Also, include Trump's criticism of the left-wing movement.

Wait, the task force has 60 days to submit a report on potential locations. That's important. And the garden will be open by July 4, 2026, for the 250th anniversary. I should mention that too.

I need to structure it clearly, starting with the announcement, the purpose, the statues included, the timeline, and the context of the debate. Also, highlight Trump's stance against removing statues as part of a cultural revolution.

Let me make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit. I'll start by stating the executive order's purpose, list some notable figures, mention the task force, the deadline, and then address the criticism of removing statues. Conclude with Trump's opposition to the left-wing movement.

Okay, that should cover all the main points succinctly. Let me put it together.
