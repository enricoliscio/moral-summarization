SUMMARY:

President Trump unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans, amidst calls to tear down Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr., and will be open prior to July 4, 2026. The executive order emphasizes the importance of preserving American history and heritage, stating that "to destroy a monument is to desecrate our common inheritance." Trump also railed against those tearing down statues, accusing them of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. He warned against a "left-wing cultural revolution" that seeks to "tear down every statue, symbol and memory of our national heritage," and instead emphasized the need to "preserve the memory of our American story" and "stir in us a spirit of responsibility" for future generations.
