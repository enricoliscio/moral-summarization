SUMMARY:

President Trump has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The garden will preserve the memory of America's story and stir a sense of responsibility for future generations. The executive order establishes a task force to submit a report on options for the garden's creation, including potential locations. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The order also addresses current calls to topple Confederate statues, emphasizing that destroying monuments is a desecration of our common inheritance. Trump railed against those tearing down statues, accusing them of wanting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. He warned that the left-wing cultural revolution seeks to destroy America's national heritage and erase its history. The garden is set to open prior to July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
