SUMMARY: In an effort to preserve the memory of prominent Americans and their sacrifices, President Trump has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes". This comes amid protests and calls to tear down Confederate statues and address racist iconography across the country. The executive order establishes a task force to oversee the creation of the garden, which will feature statues of notable Americans such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman, among others. The order also addresses the recent vandalism and destruction of monuments, stating that these statues belong to all Americans and should not be discarded at the whim of those inflamed by political passions. Trump, in an impassioned speech at Mount Rushmore, accused those tearing down Confederate statues of wanting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. He decried the "left-wing cultural revolution" as an attempt to destroy the common inheritance of American heritage. The garden, which will be open prior to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, aims to honor the virtues and talents of exceptional Americans who placed their lives in service to the nation.
