SUMMARY: President Trump has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes", a response to calls across the nation to tear down Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The executive order, announced during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, establishes a task force to build a garden featuring statues of prominent Americans, including Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman. The garden will preserve the memory of America's story and serve as a reminder of the responsibilities yet to come. It is a moral stand against the desecration of the nation's common inheritance, as many monuments have been vandalized or destroyed in recent protests. Trump's impassioned speech at Mount Rushmore accused activists of attempting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and impose a "new far-left fascism" that seeks to tear down all monuments, symbols, and memories of America's national heritage. The executive order underscores the importance of preserving the nation's history and the virtues and sacrifices of exceptional Americans, despite their flaws. It is a stand against the whims of fashionable political passions, preserving the past for future generations.
