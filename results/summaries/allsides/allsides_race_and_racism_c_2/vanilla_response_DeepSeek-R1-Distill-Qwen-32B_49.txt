Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's see what the article is about. It's about the White House unveiling an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes with statues of prominent Americans. President Trump announced this during the Fourth of July at Mount Rushmore. 

The article mentions that this comes at a time when the country is dealing with calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist symbols. The executive order talks about preserving the memory through statues as silent teachers. It establishes a task force to build the garden, which will include statues of people like John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and others. The garden needs to be ready by July 4, 2026, for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

The order also addresses the current movement to topple Confederate statues, arguing against destroying monuments as it's seen as desecrating the nation's inheritance. Trump criticized those tearing down statues, saying it's an attempt to overthrow the American Revolution and destroy the country's civilization. He also criticized left-wing cultural revolution as a new fascism.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the creation of the National Garden, the context of current statue removal movements, the list of notable figures, the deadline, and Trump's opposition to removing statues. I should make sure to mention that the garden will have statues of various heroes, the task force's role, and the opposition to dismantling historical monuments.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the announcement, the purpose, the task force, the list of statues, the deadline, and then the opposition to removing other statues. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit.
