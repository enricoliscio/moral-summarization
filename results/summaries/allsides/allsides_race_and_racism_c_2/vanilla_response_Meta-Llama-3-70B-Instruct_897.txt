SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The order, announced during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, comes as the nation grapples with calls to tear down Confederate statues. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The executive order also addresses current calls to topple Confederate statues, emphasizing that monuments belong to generations past and future. President Trump railed against people tearing down statues, accusing them of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. The task force has 60 days to submit a report detailing options for the creation of the National Garden, which is set to be open prior to July 4, 2026.
