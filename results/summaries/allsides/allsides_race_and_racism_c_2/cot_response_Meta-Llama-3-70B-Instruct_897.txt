SUMMARY:
The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The order establishes a task force to submit a report on the garden's creation within 60 days. The garden will be open prior to July 4, 2026. President Trump announced the order during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, where he railed against people tearing down statues of Confederate leaders, accusing them of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. He warned against a "far-left fascism" that demands "absolute allegiance" and seeks to "tear down every statue, symbol and memory of our national heritage." The order underscores that destroying monuments is to "desecrate our common inheritance" and that these statues belong to generations yet unborn. END OF SUMMARY.
