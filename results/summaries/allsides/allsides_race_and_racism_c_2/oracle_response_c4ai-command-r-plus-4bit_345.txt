SUMMARY: On Friday, the White House announced an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" that will feature statues of prominent Americans. This order comes amidst nationwide debates about tearing down Confederate statues and addressing other racist symbols. The executive order emphasizes the educational and inspirational value of statues, calling them "silent teachers." It establishes a task force to oversee the creation of the garden, which will include statues of influential Americans such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman, among others. The order also addresses the current movement to topple Confederate statues, noting that some activists have called for the removal of monuments to figures who owned slaves but were not Confederates, such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The order condemns the destruction of monuments as a desecration of our shared history and emphasizes that these statues belong to all generations. President Trump, in a speech at Mount Rushmore, strongly criticized those seeking to tear down statues, accusing them of attempting to overthrow the American Revolution and impose a "new far-left fascism." He vowed that this cultural revolution would not succeed in tearing down our national heritage. The National Garden of American Heroes is expected to open before July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
END OF SUMMARY.
