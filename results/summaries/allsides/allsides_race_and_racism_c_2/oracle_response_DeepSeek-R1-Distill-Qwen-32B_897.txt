Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. The article is about Trump's executive order creating a National Garden of American Heroes with statues of prominent figures. It's mentioned during a Fourth of July event at Mount Rushmore, which is interesting because Mount Rushmore itself is a site with statues of presidents, some of whom owned slaves, like Jefferson.

The author uses a lot of morally charged words, like "preserve," "sacrifices," "service," "destroy," "desecrate," and others. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these words as possible without losing the essence of the article.

The article talks about the context of the current movement to remove Confederate statues and other racist symbols. Trump is countering that by promoting this new garden, emphasizing the importance of preserving history and not discarding statues, which he sees as part of the national heritage. He argues against the destruction of statues, saying it's desecrating the common inheritance.

I should highlight the contrast between Trump's stance and the current protests. Also, the list of statues includes both celebrated figures and some controversial ones, like Jefferson, who owned slaves. The executive order also mentions that some local governments are taking down statues, which is part of the ongoing debate.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the creation of the garden, the list of statues, the context of the debate over Confederate statues, Trump's arguments against destruction, and the moral framing words.

Let me structure it: Start with the executive order and its purpose, mention the list of statues, the context of the debate, Trump's arguments using the moral words, and the goal of the garden to preserve heritage.

I should make sure to include words like "preserve," "sacrifices," "service," "destroy," "desecrate," "protests," "vandalized," "destroyed," "allegiance," "revolution," "tear," etc. 

Wait, the summary needs to be in the user's own words but using the moral terms. So, I'll paraphrase the key points, making sure those words are included naturally.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes the necessary moral framing words.

SUMMARY: The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent figures like John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others. This initiative, announced during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, aims to preserve the memory of the nation's story and honor the sacrifices and service of its heroes. The order emphasizes that these statues are not to be discarded but are part of the country's common inheritance, belonging to past and future generations. It condemns the destruction of statues, calling it an act of desecration, and criticizes recent protests where monuments were vandalized or destroyed. The executive order also addresses calls to remove Confederate statues and other symbols, arguing that tearing down such monuments would erase the nation's heritage. President Trump criticized those seeking to dismantle statues, accusing them of attempting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. The garden, set to open by July 4, 2026, will serve as a symbol of the nation's values and achievements, while also maintaining a collection of statues for temporary display. The order underscores the importance of preserving history and resisting the far-left push to erase the past. END OF SUMMARY.
