SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The order comes as the nation grapples with calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King Jr. The executive order also condemns the destruction of monuments, framing it as an attack on American heritage and a threat to the country's very foundation. President Trump accused those tearing down statues of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. He warned that this "left-wing cultural revolution" seeks to destroy the civilization that has lifted humanity to new heights of achievement and progress. The order establishes a task force to oversee the creation of the garden, which is set to open before July 4, 2026.
