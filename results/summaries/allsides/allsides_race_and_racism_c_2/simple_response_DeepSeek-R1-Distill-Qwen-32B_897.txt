Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's executive order for the National Garden of American Heroes. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, okay, so first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about Trump announcing the creation of a new monument garden featuring statues of prominent Americans. He's doing this during the Fourth of July at Mount Rushmore, which is symbolic. The context is that there's a movement to remove Confederate statues, and Trump is countering that by emphasizing the importance of preserving historical statues.

I notice that the executive order mentions the statues as "silent teachers" and talks about them preserving the American story. Trump is arguing against the destruction of statues, calling it a desecration of the nation's heritage. He's framing the current protests as a left-wing cultural revolution trying to overthrow the American Revolution, which he sees as a threat to national identity and progress.

So, the moral framing here is about preserving history and national identity versus the radical left's attempt to erase it. Trump is positioning himself as a defender of American heritage and against the so-called "cancel culture."

I need to make sure the summary captures this tension. It should mention the creation of the garden, the list of figures included, the criticism of removing statues, and Trump's argument against the left-wing movement. Also, I should keep it under 200 words and ensure it's concise but covers all key points.

Let me structure it: start with the announcement, mention the context of the statue removal debates, highlight the executive order's points about preserving history, list some notable figures, and then address Trump's criticism of the left. Make sure to include his view that tearing down statues is harmful to the nation's soul.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to summarizing the article's content, especially the moral arguments presented. Also, ensure that the summary flows well and is within the word limit.
