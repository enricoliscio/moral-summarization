SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The order, announced by President Trump during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, comes as the nation grapples with calls to remove Confederate statues and racist iconography. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The executive order also addresses the current controversy over Confederate statues, emphasizing that monuments belong to all generations and should not be destroyed. Trump railed against those tearing down statues, accusing them of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. The task force established by the order has 60 days to submit a report on options for the garden's creation, with the goal of opening the site prior to July 4, 2026.
