Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump announcing an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes with statues of prominent figures. It mentions that this comes during a time when there's a movement to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography. 

I need to capture the moral arguments presented. The executive order emphasizes preserving history and the importance of these statues as silent teachers, highlighting the virtues of the individuals despite their flaws. Trump is arguing against the destruction of statues, calling it a desecration of heritage and linking it to a far-left movement trying to erase history. 

I should make sure the summary reflects both the creation of the garden and the opposition to removing statues, including the moral stance that destroying monuments is harmful to the nation's identity. Also, the inclusion of various notable figures in the garden should be noted, as well as the mention of other statues like Washington and Jefferson, showing the broader context of the debate.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the creation of the garden, the moral defense of statues, the criticism of removing them, and the political context. I'll structure it to first introduce the executive order, then the moral framing, and finally the opposition's stance. That should cover the essential elements while staying within the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Trump has issued an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent historical figures, during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore. The move comes amid nationwide debates over the removal of Confederate statues and other symbols of racism. The order emphasizes the importance of preserving historical monuments as "silent teachers" that reflect the nation's story and inspire gratitude for the contributions of its heroes, despite their flaws. It also condemns the recent destruction of statues, calling it a desecration of the nation's shared heritage. Trump criticized efforts to remove Confederate statues, arguing that such actions are part of a "far-left cultural revolution" aiming to erase American history and identity. The garden, set to open by July 4, 2026, will include statues of figures like John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others. The executive order also addresses calls to dismantle monuments to slave owners like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, framing such actions as an attack on the nation's founding principles. Trump warned against this movement, claiming it seeks to "overthrow the American Revolution" and erase the achievements of Western civilization. END OF SUMMARY.
