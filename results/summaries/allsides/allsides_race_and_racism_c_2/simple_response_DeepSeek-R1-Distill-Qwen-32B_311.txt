Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's executive order creating a National Garden of American Heroes. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Trump announced an executive order during the Fourth of July at Mount Rushmore. The garden will have statues of prominent Americans, including some with controversial pasts like Jefferson and Washington. He's doing this while there are ongoing calls to remove Confederate statues and other symbols of racism.

The executive order talks about the statues as silent teachers preserving the American story and inspiring responsibility. It also addresses the current movement to topple Confederate statues, arguing that destroying them desecrates the nation's heritage. Trump criticizes the left for wanting to erase history and claims they're trying to overthrow the American Revolution.

I need to make sure the summary includes the creation of the garden, the list of figures included, the context of the current debates over statues, and Trump's argument against removing them. Also, I should highlight his moral stance against erasing history and his criticism of the left's actions.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral framing by emphasizing the preservation of heritage and the opposition to removing statues. Let me structure the summary to first introduce the executive order, then mention the context, the list of statues, and Trump's arguments against statue removal. I'll make sure to include his strong language about cultural revolution and the importance of heritage.

Wait, the user also mentioned that I'm a moral expert, so I should ensure that the summary not only presents the facts but also captures the moral perspective presented in the article. That means highlighting Trump's defense of historical monuments as part of the nation's identity and his criticism of those who want to remove them as trying to erase the past.

I should also note the specific figures included in the garden, like Jefferson and Washington, even though they had flaws, to show that the order acknowledges their contributions despite their imperfections. This ties into the moral framing of preserving the full American story, including both achievements and flaws.

Let me make sure the summary flows well, starting with the announcement, then the purpose, the context of the debate, the list of statues, and Trump's arguments against removal. I'll avoid getting bogged down in too many details but focus on the key moral points he's making.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the essential moral arguments presented.

SUMMARY: President Trump has issued an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent historical figures, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Jefferson. The order, announced during a Fourth of July event at Mount Rushmore, aims to preserve the nation's heritage and honor those who contributed to its history, despite their flaws. Trump criticized efforts to remove Confederate statues and other historical monuments, arguing that destroying them desecrates the nation's common inheritance and represents a "cultural revolution" seeking to erase America's founding principles. He warned against a "new far-left fascism" that seeks to dismantle symbols of national heritage, asserting that such actions aim to overthrow the American Revolution and erase the civilization that "rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence, and hunger." The garden, set to open by July 4, 2026, will also include a collection of statues for temporary display, emphasizing the importance of preserving historical memory. END OF SUMMARY.
