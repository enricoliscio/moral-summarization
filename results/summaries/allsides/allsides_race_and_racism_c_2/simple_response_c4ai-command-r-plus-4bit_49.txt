SUMMARY: On Friday, amidst the controversy surrounding the removal of Confederate statues, President Trump signed an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes." The garden will feature statues of prominent Americans, including Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King Jr., aiming to preserve the memory of the nation's history and inspire future generations. The executive order emphasizes the importance of monuments as teachers, preserving the country's shared inheritance. President Trump strongly condemned the destruction of statues, labeling it as a "new far-left fascism" that aims to overthrow the American Revolution and erase the nation's heritage. He argued that these monuments belong to all Americans and should not be discarded due to short-sighted political passions. The garden, scheduled to open before July 4, 2026, will be a testament to the virtues, talents, and sacrifices of exceptional Americans who shaped the nation's history. The executive order also establishes a task force to identify potential locations for the garden and oversee its creation.

END OF SUMMARY.
