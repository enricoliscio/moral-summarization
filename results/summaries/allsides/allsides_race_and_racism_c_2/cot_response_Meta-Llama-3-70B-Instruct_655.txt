SUMMARY:
The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The garden will include statues of figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The executive order establishes a task force to oversee the project, which aims to complete the garden by July 4, 2026. The order also addresses the current trend of toppling Confederate statues, with President Trump condemning the actions as "desecrating our common inheritance" and driven by "fashionable political passions." Trump warned against a "far-left fascism" that seeks to "overthrow the American Revolution" and "destroy our national heritage." The president's speech emphasized the importance of preserving American history and culture. END OF SUMMARY.
