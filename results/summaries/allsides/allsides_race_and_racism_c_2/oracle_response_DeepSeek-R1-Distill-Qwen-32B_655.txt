Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The White House introduced an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes with statues of prominent figures. This comes amid calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist symbols. The order emphasizes preserving history and the contributions of heroes, while criticizing those who want to destroy statues as desecrating the past. Trump also spoke against this, calling it an attack on American values.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words from the author's list: preserve, sacrifices, placed, service, owned, destroy, desecrate, protests, vandalized, destroyed, responded, taking, discarded, overthrow, allegiance, recite, follow, censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, punished, revolution, poverty, violence, hunger, determined, tear.

I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too long. I'll focus on the key actions and the moral arguments presented. The summary should mention the creation of the garden, the list of statues, the criticism of removing statues, and Trump's opposition. I'll make sure to use words like preserve, destroy, desecrate, protests, and tear to maintain the moral framing.

I'll start by stating the executive order's purpose, then mention the statues included. Next, I'll address the criticism of removing statues and Trump's response, using the appropriate moral terms. Finally, I'll conclude with the garden's opening date and its symbolic importance.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral language without being redundant. Once done, I'll format it with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The White House has issued an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of notable Americans like John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr., amid nationwide protests calling for the removal of Confederate statues. The order emphasizes preserving the "American story" and honoring the sacrifices and contributions of heroes, while criticizing those who seek to destroy or desecrate historical monuments. President Trump condemned the vandalizing and destruction of statues, arguing that such actions discard the nation's heritage and threaten to overthrow the American Revolution. He accused left-wing activists of seeking to erase the country's founding values, leading to censorship, persecution, and punishment for dissenters. The garden, set to open by July 4, 2026, aims to celebrate the virtues of American heroes and maintain a collection of statues for public display. The executive order also highlights the importance of protecting the nation's cultural and historical legacy, warning against the far-left's determination to tear down symbols of national heritage.
