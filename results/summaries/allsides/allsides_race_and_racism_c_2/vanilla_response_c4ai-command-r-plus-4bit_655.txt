SUMMARY: On Friday evening, the White House announced an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes, featuring statues of prominent Americans. This comes amid nationwide calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The executive order establishes a task force to oversee the project, with a report due in 60 days detailing potential locations for the garden. The garden will include statues of historical figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman, among others. It will also maintain a separate collection of statues for temporary display around the country. The order emphasizes the importance of preserving monuments as a way to honor America's history and condemns their destruction or removal. During a speech at Mount Rushmore, President Trump criticized the toppling of Confederate statues, accusing activists of attempting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and impose a "left-wing cultural revolution." He vowed that the National Garden of American Heroes will be open by July 4, 2026, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
