Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article. It's about Trump announcing a National Garden of American Heroes with statues of prominent figures. The context is the current debates about removing Confederate statues and other racist symbols. 

The article mentions the executive order, the task force, the list of statues, and Trump's speech against removing statues. He argues that destroying statues is desecrating heritage and that it's part of a left-wing cultural revolution trying to overthrow the American Revolution. 

For the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me read through the article again and pick out words that carry moral connotations.

"Unveiled" - maybe, but not strongly moral. "Executive order" - neutral. "National Garden of American Heroes" - positive framing. "Prominent Americans" - positive. "Calls to tear down Confederate statues" - negative framing towards tearing down. "Address other racist iconography" - negative. "Silent teachers" - positive. "Preserve memory" - positive. "American story" - positive. "Spirit of responsibility" - positive. "Chapters yet unwritten" - neutral. "Gratitude" - positive. "Exceptional fellow citizens" - positive. "Flaws" - neutral. "Virtues" - positive. "Talents" - positive. "Service" - positive. "Accomplishments" - positive. "Sacrifices" - positive. "Desecrate" - negative. "Common inheritance" - positive. "Vandalized" - negative. "Destroyed" - negative. "Discarded" - negative. "Fashionable political passions" - negative. "Belong to generations" - positive. "Overthrow the American Revolution" - negative. "New far-left fascism" - negative. "Absolute allegiance" - negative. "Censored" - negative. "Banished" - negative. "Blacklisted" - negative. "Persecuted" - negative. "Punished" - negative. "Cultural revolution" - negative. "Destroy" - negative. "Civilization" - positive. "Rescued" - positive. "Poverty" - negative. "Disease" - negative. "Violence" - negative. "Hunger" - negative. "Lifted" - positive. "Achievement" - positive. "Discovery" - positive. "Progress" - positive. "Tear down" - negative. "Statues" - neutral. "Symbols" - neutral. "Memories" - neutral. "National heritage" - positive.

Wait, I need to make sure I'm only picking single words that are morally framed. So words like "desecrate," "vandalized," "destroyed," "discarded," "fashionable," "censored," "banished," "blacklisted," "persecuted," "punished," "destroy," "rescued," "poverty," "disease," "violence," "hunger," "lifted," "achievement," "discovery," "progress," "tear down." Also, "heroes," "service," "gratitude," "virtues," "flaws," "exceptional," "inheritance," "revolution," "fascism," "allegiance," "cultural," "civilization."

I think I've got all the morally charged single words. Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these moral terms as much as possible.

The summary should mention the creation of the garden, the list of statues, the context of current debates, Trump's arguments against removing statues, and his opposition to the left-wing cultural revolution. I need to make sure to include the moral framing words like "desecrate," "vandalized," "fascism," "revolution," etc.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with Trump announcing the garden. Mention the statues. Then the context of debates about Confederate statues. Then Trump's argument that tearing down statues is desecrating heritage. Mention his criticism of the left-wing movement as fascism, trying to overthrow the American Revolution. Conclude with the garden's purpose to honor heroes and preserve history.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include the key points and the moral terms.
