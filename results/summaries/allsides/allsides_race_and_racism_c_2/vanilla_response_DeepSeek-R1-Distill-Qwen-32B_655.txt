Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Trump's executive order creating the National Garden of American Heroes. Let me read through the article carefully. 

The article mentions that the executive order was announced on July 4th at Mount Rushmore. It's interesting because it's coming up against the backdrop of people wanting to remove Confederate statues. Trump is proposing a new garden with statues of prominent Americans like Jefferson, Lincoln, and Tubman. 

I need to capture the key points: the creation of the garden, the list of statues, the task force, the deadline, and the opposition to removing Confederate statues. Also, Trump's speech where he criticized the left for trying to erase history.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating the announcement, then the purpose, the statues included, the task force's role, and then touch on the opposition to removing other statues. I should also mention Trump's criticism of the left's actions.

Wait, I need to ensure I include all important details without going over the word limit. Maybe combine some sentences to keep it brief. Also, mention the 2026 deadline for the garden's opening. 

Let me draft it: Start with the announcement, then the garden's purpose, list some notable statues, mention the task force and their deadline, then address the criticism of removing other statues, and conclude with Trump's stance against the left. 

I should check that I'm not missing any critical information. The garden includes a variety of historical figures, both heroes and those with controversial pasts. The executive order also responds to the current debate about Confederate statues, emphasizing preservation of history. 

Okay, I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll condense it into a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: The White House has announced an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent historical figures, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman. The order, unveiled during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, aims to honor American heroes while addressing the ongoing debate over Confederate statues. The garden will be funded by the Interior Department, and a task force has 60 days to propose locations and plans. The site is set to open by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The executive order also defends against the removal of historical statues, arguing that they are part of the nation's shared heritage. President Trump criticized efforts to topple statues, calling them an attack on American history and a push for a "left-wing cultural revolution." The garden will include statues of notable figures, both celebrated and controversial, and will maintain a collection for temporary displays nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
