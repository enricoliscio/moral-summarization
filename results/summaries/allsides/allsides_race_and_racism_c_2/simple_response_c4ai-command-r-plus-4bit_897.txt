SUMMARY: President Trump signed an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" in response to calls to tear down Confederate statues and address other racist iconography across the country. The order establishes a task force to oversee the creation of the garden, which will feature statues of prominent Americans such as Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, and Martin Luther King Jr. The garden aims to preserve the memory of America's history and stir a sense of responsibility for the future. It will be open to the public before July 4, 2026, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. In his speech at Mount Rushmore, Trump strongly criticized the toppling of Confederate statues, calling it a "new far-left fascism" that aims to overthrow the American Revolution and destroy American civilization. The executive order also acknowledges the controversy surrounding monuments to figures who owned slaves, such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and emphasizes the importance of preserving historical monuments as a common inheritance.
