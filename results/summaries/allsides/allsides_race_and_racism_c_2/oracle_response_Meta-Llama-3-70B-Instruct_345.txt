SUMMARY:

President Trump has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The garden will preserve the memory of our American story and stir a spirit of responsibility for the chapters yet unwritten. The executive order establishes a task force to submit a report on options for the creation of the National Garden, which will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The garden will be open prior to July 4, 2026, and will separately maintain a collection of statues for temporary display around the United States.

The order also addresses current calls to topple Confederate statues, emphasizing that destroying monuments is to desecrate our common inheritance. Trump railed against people tearing down statues, accusing them of wanting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. He warned that the left-wing cultural revolution is designed to destroy our national heritage and tear down every statue, symbol, and memory of our history.
