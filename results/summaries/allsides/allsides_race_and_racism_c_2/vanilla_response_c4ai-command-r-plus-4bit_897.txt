SUMMARY: The White House revealed an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent Americans, including Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, and Ronald Reagan. This announcement comes amid nationwide debates over Confederate statues and racist symbols. The executive order establishes a task force to oversee the garden's creation, aiming to open it by July 4, 2026. The order also addresses the recent toppling of Confederate statues, arguing that destroying monuments desecrates our shared history. President Trump, in a speech at Mount Rushmore, condemned those who tear down statues, accusing them of attempting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and imposing a "new far-left fascism." He pledged that such a cultural revolution would not happen in the United States.
