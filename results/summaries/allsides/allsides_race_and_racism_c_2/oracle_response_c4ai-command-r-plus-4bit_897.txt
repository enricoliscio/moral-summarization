SUMMARY: The White House issued an executive order to establish a "National Garden of American Heroes," which will feature statues of prominent Americans, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others. This order comes amid calls to tear down Confederate statues and address racist iconography across the country. The executive order emphasizes the importance of preserving the memory of our American story and the sacrifices made by exceptional Americans who placed their lives in the service of our nation. It also acknowledges the recent protests and the destruction of monuments, stating that these statues belong to our common inheritance and should not be discarded. The garden will be open to the public before July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. President Trump, in a speech at Mount Rushmore, strongly criticized those who want to tear down Confederate statues, accusing them of wanting to overthrow the American Revolution and fundamentally change the country. He also denounced the "new far-left fascism" that demands absolute allegiance and censors those who do not conform. Trump defended the American civilization that has lifted humanity out of poverty, violence, and hunger, stating that the current cultural revolution seeks to tear down every symbol and memory of our national heritage.
