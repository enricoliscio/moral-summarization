SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The move comes as the nation grapples with calls to tear down Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The executive order establishes a task force to create the garden, which will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman. The order also condemns the destruction of monuments, stating that they belong to future generations and should not be discarded based on "fashionable political passions." President Trump, in a speech at Mount Rushmore, railed against those tearing down statues, accusing them of seeking to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. He framed the debate as a struggle between preserving American heritage and a "left-wing cultural revolution" that seeks to destroy it.
