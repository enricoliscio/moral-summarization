SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The garden will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The executive order establishes a task force to oversee the project, which is expected to be completed by July 4, 2026. The order also addresses the current controversy surrounding Confederate statues, with President Trump condemning the destruction of monuments as an attack on American heritage. In a speech at Mount Rushmore, Trump accused those tearing down statues of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. The order aims to preserve American history and promote national pride, while also sparking debate about which figures should be honored and how to address the country's complex past.
