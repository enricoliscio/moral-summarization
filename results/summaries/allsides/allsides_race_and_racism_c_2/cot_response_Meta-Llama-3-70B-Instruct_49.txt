SUMMARY:
The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans, including John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The move comes as the nation grapples with calls to tear down Confederate statues and address racist iconography. President Trump condemned the destruction of monuments, calling it a "desecration" of our common inheritance. He railed against the "far-left fascism" that demands "absolute allegiance" and seeks to "overthrow the American Revolution" and "destroy" our national heritage. The executive order establishes a task force to create the garden, which will be open prior to July 4, 2026. The garden will "stir in us a spirit of responsibility" and "preserve the memory of our American story." END OF SUMMARY.
