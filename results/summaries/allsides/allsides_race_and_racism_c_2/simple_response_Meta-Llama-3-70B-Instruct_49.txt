SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. This move comes as the nation grapples with calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The order establishes a task force to create the garden, which will include statues of notable figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, and Martin Luther King Jr. The garden will also maintain a collection of statues for temporary display around the US. The order emphasizes the importance of preserving American history and heritage, warning that destroying monuments is a desecration of our common inheritance. President Trump has also spoken out against the destruction of Confederate statues, accusing those responsible of seeking to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. The order and Trump's speech frame the preservation of American history and heritage as a moral imperative, warning against the dangers of a "far-left fascism" that seeks to erase the country's cultural identity.
