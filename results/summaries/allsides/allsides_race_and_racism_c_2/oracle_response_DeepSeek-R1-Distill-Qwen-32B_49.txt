Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The White House has issued an executive order to create a National Garden of American Heroes with statues of prominent figures. They're responding to the movement to remove Confederate statues, emphasizing preservation of history and the importance of these statues as symbols of national heritage. The order mentions specific statues and a task force to establish the garden by 2026. Trump criticized the destruction of statues, calling it an attack on American values and a left-wing attempt to erase history. He used strong moral language like "preserve," "sacrifices," "destroy," "desecrate," and "revolution."

I should focus on including these morally charged words in the summary. I'll structure the summary to highlight the creation of the garden, the context of the statue removal movement, the list of figures, the task force's role, and Trump's criticism of statue destruction. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while retaining the moral framing.

I'll start by mentioning the executive order and its purpose, then the context of the current debates. I'll list some of the statues included and the task force's responsibility. Then, I'll address Trump's stance against statue destruction, using the moral terms he emphasized. I'll conclude by tying it to the broader cultural and political implications.

I should avoid adding my own opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article's content with the specified moral language. I'll make sure each sentence captures a key point without getting too detailed, keeping it within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The White House has issued an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes," featuring statues of prominent Americans, amid calls to remove Confederate statues. The order emphasizes preserving the "American story" through statues, which are described as "silent teachers" that inspire gratitude and responsibility. The garden will include statues of figures like John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman, among others. A task force will use Interior Department funds to establish the site, with plans to open it by July 4, 2026. The order also addresses the destruction of statues, calling it a desecration of "our common inheritance" and criticizes those who seek to discard historical symbols. President Trump condemned the removal of Confederate statues, accusing activists of attempting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and erase the nation's heritage. He warned against a "left-wing cultural revolution" aimed at dismantling statues and symbols of national heritage, asserting that such actions would "tear down every memory" of the country's history. The executive order underscores the importance of preserving historical figures, even those with flaws, as part of the nation's identity. END OF SUMMARY.
