Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about President Trump announcing an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" with statues of prominent Americans. He did this during the Fourth of July at Mount Rushmore. The context is the ongoing debates about removing Confederate statues and addressing racist symbols.

The executive order emphasizes that statues are important historical markers and should be preserved. It lists several notable figures to include in the garden. Trump criticized those who want to remove statues, calling it a form of cultural revolution aimed at overthrowing the American Revolution. He argues that destroying statues desecrates the nation's heritage and is driven by political passions.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, keeping the moral arguments intact. The summary should mention the creation of the garden, the context of statue removal debates, the list of honorees, and Trump's criticism of the movement to tear down statues, highlighting his view that it's an attack on American heritage.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the executive order, then the context, followed by the task force and the list of statues. Then, I'll address Trump's stance against removing statues, emphasizing his moral argument about preserving history and the threat of a cultural revolution.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows logically. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are included without exceeding the word limit.
