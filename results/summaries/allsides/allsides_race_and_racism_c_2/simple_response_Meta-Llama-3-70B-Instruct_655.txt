SUMMARY:

The White House has unveiled an executive order to create a "National Garden of American Heroes" featuring statues of prominent Americans. This move comes as the nation grapples with calls to remove Confederate statues and address racist iconography. The order establishes a task force to create the garden, which will include statues of notable figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., and Harriet Tubman. The garden is set to open before July 4, 2026. The order also addresses the current trend of toppling Confederate statues, with President Trump accusing those responsible of wanting to "overthrow the American Revolution" and fundamentally change the country. He warned that destroying monuments is a form of desecration, and that these statues belong to future generations. The president's speech at Mount Rushmore emphasized the importance of preserving American heritage and warned against a "left-wing cultural revolution" that seeks to destroy the country's national identity.
