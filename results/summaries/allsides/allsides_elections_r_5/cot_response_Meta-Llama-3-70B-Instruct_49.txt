SUMMARY:
President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, Obama insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, and Obama's cynical politics led to the murder of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi and Obama's refusal to order a military response led to the tragedy. The Benghazi atrocity was an act of war against America, and Obama's deception and manipulation campaign make him unfit to be president. END OF SUMMARY.
