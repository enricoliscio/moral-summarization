SUMMARY: President Obama's re-election campaign is facing challenges due to revelations about the Benghazi attack and his administration's handling of the incident. Emails and diplomatic cables indicate that the administration misled the public by blaming the attack on spontaneous protests and a controversial video. Testimonies and evidence show that the State Department and the CIA were aware that the attack was perpetrated by jihadists. An email sent to the White House Situation Room shortly after the attack began confirmed that a terrorist group affiliated with al Qaeda had claimed responsibility. Despite this knowledge, Obama continued to blame the video, attempting to cover up his administration's failure. The article suggests that the motivation behind the cover-up was political, as Obama wanted to maintain the narrative that al Qaeda was degraded under his presidency. The article further criticizes Obama's intervention in Libya, arguing that it has led to the rise of radical Islam and a failed state. It highlights the lack of security at the Benghazi compound and the administration's neglect of requests for enhanced security. The author concludes that Obama's inaction during the attack and his subsequent cover-up make him unfit to be president.
