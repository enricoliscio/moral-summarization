SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, deliberately misleading the public about the true nature of the event. Despite knowing that the attack was a terrorist assault, Obama insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video. The real reason for the cover-up is cynical politics, as the Benghazi attack contradicts Obama's central campaign narrative that he killed Osama bin Laden and degraded al Qaeda. In reality, al Qaeda is on the rise, and Obama's military intervention in Libya has been a disaster, making the country safe for radical Islam. The attack on the US compound was a preventable tragedy, and Obama's inaction and refusal to order a military response make him unfit to be president. The Benghazi atrocity was an act of war against America, and Obama's deception and manipulation campaign warrant his defeat in November.

END OF SUMMARY.
