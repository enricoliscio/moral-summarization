Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the author's perspective. The article is critical of President Obama's handling of the Benghazi attack, accusing him of deception and failure to protect American personnel.

The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words.

Starting with Step 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "deception," "eroding," "failure," "cynical," "atrocity," "blood on his hands," "sacrificed," "tragedy," "abandoned," "butchered," "unfit" stand out. These words are used to convey blame, criticism, and moral judgment against Obama.

For the summary, I should condense the article, highlighting the key accusations: Obama knew about the terrorist attack but lied, leading to the deaths of diplomatic personnel. The article also criticizes his foreign policy in Libya, leading to an increase in jihadist activity. The summary needs to reflect the moral framing by using those identified words and maintaining the critical tone.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: deception, failure to protect, Obama's responsibility, the consequences of his policies, and the moral judgment against him.

Let me structure the summary to include the key events and the moral implications. I'll mention the initial false claims, the evidence of a terrorist attack, the cover-up, the failure to respond, and the resulting loss of life. I'll use the morally framed words to emphasize the criticism.

I should also make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the deception, moving to the consequences, and ending with the judgment against Obama's fitness for office.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms without exceeding the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama is accused of deception and failure to protect American personnel during the Benghazi attack. Emails and cables reveal he knew it was a terrorist act but falsely blamed it on protests. Senior officials testified that the attack was a jihadist assault, and the State Department even received a claim of responsibility from Ansar al-Sharia. Obama allegedly covered up the truth to maintain his narrative of weakening al Qaeda. The article criticizes his Libyan intervention, claiming it enabled radical Islam to flourish. Ambassador Stevens and three others were killed because Obama refused to authorize a military response, prioritizing Libyan sovereignty over American lives. The attack was an act of war, and the author argues Obamaâ€™s actions make him unfit to lead. END OF SUMMARY.
