Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, and it needs to end with specific tokens. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is critical of President Obama's handling of the Benghazi attack in 2012. It accuses him of deception and mismanagement. The key points are:

1. The administration lied about the attack being spontaneous protests instead of a terrorist act.
2. Emails and cables show the State Department knew it was a terrorist attack but the White House didn't act.
3. The article argues that Obama's foreign policy failures in Libya allowed al-Qaeda to expand.
4. The attack could have been prevented with a military response, but Obama hesitated due to political reasons.
5. The author believes Obama is unfit to be president because of this.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I should make sure to include all these points but keep it concise. I have to maintain the moral tone, which is very critical of Obama. Words like "deception," "cover-up," "failure," and "unfit" are important to include.

I also need to structure the summary logically, starting with the deception, then the consequences, and ending with the conclusion about Obama's fitness for office. I'll make sure each sentence flows into the next without adding any personal opinions beyond what's in the article.

Let me check the word count as I go. I'll aim for around 200 words, so each sentence needs to be tight. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the main accusations and their implications.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified. I'll review it to ensure it's accurate and maintains the original moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article accuses President Obama of deception and mismanagement in the aftermath of the 2012 Benghazi attack, arguing that his administration misled the public by claiming the attack was a spontaneous protest rather than a terrorist act. Emails and diplomatic cables reveal that senior officials knew it was a terrorist assault, yet Obama insisted on blaming an anti-Muslim video. The article suggests that Obama’s foreign policy failures in Libya enabled al-Qaeda’s expansion, making the country a safe haven for jihadists. It claims that a military response could have prevented the attack, but Obama hesitated to act, prioritizing political optics over American lives. The author argues that Obama’s actions, including a cover-up and manipulation campaign, make him unfit to lead. END OF SUMMARY.
