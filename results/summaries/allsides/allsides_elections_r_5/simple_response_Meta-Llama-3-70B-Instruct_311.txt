SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, which threatens his re-election bid. Despite knowing the truth, Obama blamed a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video for the attack, instead of acknowledging it was a terrorist atrocity. The administration's central campaign narrative, that Obama killed Osama bin Laden and degraded al Qaeda, was contradicted by the Benghazi attack, which showed al Qaeda is on the rise. The president's military intervention in Libya has been a disaster, making the country a failed Islamist state. Obama's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the murder of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. diplomatic personnel. The president's inaction during the attack, prioritizing Libyan "sovereignty" over American lives, is a grave moral failure. Obama's deception and manipulation campaign render him unfit to be president.

END OF SUMMARY.
