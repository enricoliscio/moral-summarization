Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the query carefully. The user wants a summary of the provided article, making sure to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. They also specified that the summary should be under 200 words and follow a specific format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Obama's administration being accused of deception regarding the Benghazi attack. The key points are that the administration initially claimed the attack was spontaneous, but evidence shows it was a terrorist act. Emails and cables indicate that the State Department knew it was a terrorist group responsible. The article also criticizes Obama's foreign policy in Libya, suggesting it enabled radical Islam and led to the attack.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words used by the author. The list provided includes words like deceived, knew, terrorist, assault, cover-up, failure, etc. I should incorporate as many of these as possible without making the summary too wordy.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the deception, the terrorist nature of the attack, the cover-up, and the consequences. I'll mention the emails and cables, the initial false claims, the knowledge of the administration, the failure to respond adequately, and the political implications.

I also need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points. Maybe start by stating the deception, then the terrorist attack, the cover-up, the failure to protect, and the political motives. I'll make sure to include words like "deception," "terrorist assault," "cover-up," "failure," "murdered," and "American blood on his hands."

I should avoid adding any personal opinions beyond what's stated in the article. The summary should reflect the author's framing without introducing new perspectives.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft a concise summary that hits all these points, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the key morally charged terms.

SUMMARY: President Obama is accused of deception and failure in handling the Benghazi attack, which the administration initially blamed on "spontaneous protests" despite knowing it was a terrorist assault. Emails and cables reveal that the State Department identified Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist group, as responsible within hours of the attack, yet Obama misled the public to cover up the administration's failure. The article criticizes Obama's Libya intervention, claiming it enabled radical Islam and made the country unsafe. The consulate was attacked despite requests for enhanced security, and a U.S. drone monitored the compound while fighter jets were nearby, yet Obama refused to order a military response to avoid violating Libyan "sovereignty." The author argues that Obama's actions, including the cover-up and manipulation, make him unfit to lead, with American lives lost as a result. The attack is framed as an act of war against the U.S., and Obama is held accountable for the tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
