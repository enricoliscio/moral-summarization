SUMMARY: President Obama's re-election campaign is facing challenges due to revelations about the administration's handling of the Benghazi attack. Evidence suggests that the Obama administration misled the public by blaming the attack on spontaneous protests and a controversial video. Testimonies and documents indicate that the State Department and the CIA were aware that the attack was a premeditated terrorist act by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group. This incident raises concerns about the rise of al-Qaeda and the unstable situation in Libya, which contradicts Obama's campaign narrative of degrading al-Qaeda. The article also criticizes Obama's intervention in Libya, claiming it has led to a failed Islamist state with increasing jihadist activity. The security requests for the Benghazi compound were denied, resulting in the tragic deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans. The article concludes that Obama's inaction during the attack and subsequent cover-up are reasons for his defeat in the upcoming election.

END OF SUMMARY.
