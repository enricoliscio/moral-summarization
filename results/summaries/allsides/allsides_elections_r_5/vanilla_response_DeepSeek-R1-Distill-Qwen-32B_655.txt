Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about President Obama and the Benghazi attack. The user wants a concise summary of about 200 words, so I should focus on the key points without getting bogged down in details.

First, the article talks about how Obama's administration misled the public regarding the Benghazi attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest when it was actually a terrorist attack. That's a crucial point to include.

Next, the timeline: the administration's initial claim, the emails and cables showing they knew it was a terrorist act, and the cover-up. I should mention that senior officials testified that there were no protests and that Ansar al-Sharia claimed responsibility.

The article also connects this to Obama's foreign policy, particularly his claims about degrading al-Qaeda. The Benghazi attack contradicts that narrative, showing al-Qaeda's resurgence. That's another important point.

Additionally, the article discusses Libya's instability post-intervention, with jihadists gaining strength and stolen weapons. It's important to note that the consulate had been attacked before and that security requests were denied.

The failure to respond militarily is another key point. The drones and jets were available but not used because of sovereignty concerns, leading to the deaths of the diplomatic staff.

Finally, the article argues that Obama's actions make him unfit for office, which is a strong statement to include.

I should structure the summary to cover these points: the deception, the terrorist nature of the attack, the administration's cover-up, the implications for Obama's foreign policy, Libya's instability, the failure to respond, and the conclusion about Obama's fitness for office.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise and make sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: The article accuses President Obama of misleading the public regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest caused by an anti-Muslim video, despite knowing it was a terrorist assault. Emails and testimonies reveal that senior officials and the CIA identified Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaeda affiliate, as responsible within hours. The administration's cover-up aimed to protect Obama's narrative of defeating al-Qaeda, which the Benghazi attack contradicted. Libya, following Obama's intervention, became a haven for jihadists, with stolen weapons and rising violence. The consulate had been attacked twice before, and security requests were ignored. A U.S. drone monitored the attack, and military assets were nearby, but Obama hesitated to act due to sovereignty concerns, allowing the consulate to be overrun. The article argues that Obama's actions, including the cover-up and failure to protect American personnel, make him unfit for office. END OF SUMMARY.
