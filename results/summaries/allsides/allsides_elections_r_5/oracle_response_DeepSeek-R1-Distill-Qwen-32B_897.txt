Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words. 

First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about President Obama's administration being accused of deceiving the public regarding the Benghazi attack. The author uses strong terms like "deception," "terrorist assault," and "cover-up." 

I should identify the key points: the administration lied about the cause, knew it was a terrorist attack, failed to protect the consulate, and didn't respond adequately. The moral framing is about Obama's responsibility and failure.

Next, I need to summarize this in under 200 words, using as many of the listed words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main events: the attack, the initial false claims, the knowledge of the administration, the cover-up, and the consequences.

I should make sure to include words like "deception," "terrorist," "cover-up," "failure," and "murdered." I need to maintain the tone of criticism towards Obama's actions and their implications.

I'll structure the summary to flow from the event to the administration's response and the moral implications. I'll also highlight the consequences, like the loss of lives and the impact on Obama's credibility.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary is concise, sticks to the facts, and uses the moral language effectively without adding personal opinions beyond what's in the article.

SUMMARY: President Obama is accused of deception and cover-up regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others. Despite knowing it was a terrorist assault, the administration falsely blamed it on protests and an anti-Muslim video. Evidence shows the State Department and CIA identified Ansar al-Sharia, an al Qaeda affiliate, as responsible within hours. Obama allegedly misled the public to protect his narrative of combating terrorism, as Libya had become a haven for jihadists due to his intervention. The consulate was repeatedly attacked, with requests for enhanced security denied. A U.S. drone monitored the attack, but no military response was ordered, allegedly to avoid violating Libyan sovereignty. The author argues Obama's inaction and cover-up make him unfit for office, as he prioritized political optics over American lives. The attack was an act of war, and Obama's failure to act or admit the truth is seen as a moral failure. END OF SUMMARY.
