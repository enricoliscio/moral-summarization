SUMMARY: President Obama finds himself entangled in a web of deception, as the Libyagate scandal threatens to ensnare his re-election bid. Multiple emails and diplomatic cables reveal a deliberate attempt to deceive the public, eroding the credibility and trustworthiness of the Obama administration. The scandal revolves around the Benghazi attack, which the administration initially blamed on spontaneous protests and an anti-Muslim video. However, evidence shows that Mr. Obama knew the attack was perpetrated by jihadists affiliated with al Qaeda. The administration's cover-up was a desperate attempt to conceal its failure and maintain its cynical political narratives. The truth is that al Qaeda is not in retreat but on the rise, and Mr. Obama's intervention in Libya has been a disaster, sacrificing American lives on the altar of his political ambitions. The Benghazi atrocity was an act of war, an invasion of American soil, and Mr. Obama's refusal to order a military response amounts to an unfitting manipulation of the truth. This scandal alone should defeat him in the upcoming election. END OF SUMMARY.
