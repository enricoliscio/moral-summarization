SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a web of deception that may hurt his re-election bid. Emails and cables reveal that he deceived the public about the Benghazi attack, insisting it was a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video. In reality, the attack was a premeditated terrorist assault by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, Ansar al-Sharia. The administration knew this within 24 hours of the attack and had evidence of it, yet Mr. Obama misled the public to cover up his failures. This was a cynical political move to maintain the narrative that al Qaeda was in retreat. In truth, Libya has become a failed state, with jihadists roaming free and American officials requesting enhanced security. Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans were murdered, and their deaths could have been prevented with a rapid military response. Mr. Obama refused to order such a response, sacrificing American lives to uphold Libyan sovereignty. This atrocity was an act of war, and Mr. Obama's cover-up and manipulation of the truth are unfitting of a president.

END OF SUMMARY.
