Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is pretty intense, criticizing Obama's handling of the Benghazi attack. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the article talks about how Obama's administration deceived the public about the Benghazi attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest when it was actually a terrorist attack. The author uses words like "deception," "deliberately deceived," "false," and "cover-up." I need to make sure these strong moral terms are included.

The article mentions that senior officials knew it was a terrorist attack but Obama still misled the public. Words like "knew," "blamed," "misled," and "cover" are important here. I should highlight that Obama was aware of the truth but didn't act on it.

Then, the article connects this to Obama's foreign policy, especially his claims about weakening al-Qaeda. The Benghazi attack contradicts that narrative, showing al-Qaeda is actually on the rise. Terms like "contradicts," "rise," and "failed" are key. I need to convey that Obama's policies didn't work as intended.

The author also criticizes Obama's intervention in Libya, calling it a disaster. Words like "disaster," "failed," "expanded," and "safe havens" are part of the moral framing. I should mention how Libya became a safe haven for jihadists because of Obama's actions.

Another point is the failure to protect the consulate. The article says requests for enhanced security were denied, and even though a drone was overhead, no help was sent. Terms like "sacrificed," "abandoned," "butchered," and "response" are used here. I need to show that Obama's inaction led to the deaths of the diplomats.

Lastly, the author uses strong language like "murdered," "American blood on his hands," and "unfit to be president." These are clear moral condemnations. I should include these to reflect the author's stance.

Putting it all together, I need a concise summary that hits all these points with the moral terms intact. I'll structure it to first talk about the deception, then the failure of foreign policy, followed by the security failure, and end with the moral judgment against Obama.

Let me check the word count to make sure it's under 200. I'll need to be concise but include all the key morally charged words. Maybe start with the deception, move to the administration's knowledge, then the foreign policy failure, security negligence, and conclude with the moral judgment.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring all the important moral terms are included without making it too lengthy.

SUMMARY: President Obama is accused of deception and cover-up regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was falsely blamed on a protest instead of being acknowledged as a terrorist assault by Ansar al-Sharia, linked to al-Qaeda. Senior officials knew it was a terrorist attack, yet Obama misled the public to hide his administration's failure. The attack contradicts Obama's claim of degrading al-Qaeda, as the group is expanding in Libya and other regions. Obama's intervention in Libya is criticized as a disaster, enabling jihadists to thrive and steal weapons. Despite warnings and requests for enhanced security, the consulate was left vulnerable. A U.S. drone monitored the attack, but no military response was ordered, allegedly to avoid violating Libyan sovereignty. The author argues that Obama's actions, including the cover-up and failure to protect U.S. personnel, make him unfit for office, with American lives lost on his watch. END OF SUMMARY.
