SUMMARY: President Obama has been accused of deception and misleading the public regarding the Benghazi attack, which has haunted his presidency. Evidence suggests he knew the attack was perpetrated by jihadists affiliated with al Qaeda, yet he falsely claimed it was a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video. This deception was aimed at covering up his administration's failure and preserving his political narrative of degrading al Qaeda. Obama's intervention in Libya has been a disaster, with jihadists targeting minorities and imposing their rule. The attack on the consulate, which resulted in the sacrifice of American lives, was an act of war against America. Obama's refusal to order a military response and his systematic cover-up and manipulation campaign show his unfitness for the presidency. He has American blood on his hands, and his cynical politics and multilateral interventionism have led to tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
