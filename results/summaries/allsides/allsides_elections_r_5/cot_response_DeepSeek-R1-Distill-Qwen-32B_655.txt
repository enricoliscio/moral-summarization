Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all the single words that are morally framed, and then writing a concise summary using those words.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "deception," "eroding," "failure," "cynical," "disaster," "sacrificed," "butchered," "unfit" stand out as they express negative judgments about Obama's actions. I'll list each of these under STEP 1 with asterisks.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include the identified moral terms. The article accuses Obama of misleading the public about the Benghazi attack, knowing it was a terrorist act. It also criticizes his Libyan intervention as a failure, leading to increased jihadist activity. The summary should highlight these points, emphasizing the moral failings and the consequences of his actions.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the deception and cover-up, then the consequences of the Libyan intervention, and finally the failure to protect the consulate. I'll make sure to use the moral words to maintain the original tone.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point without unnecessary details. Keeping it concise while preserving the moral framing is key. I'll avoid any markdown and stick to plain text as per the instructions.

Double-checking to make sure all the moral words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's critical stance towards Obama's handling of the Benghazi attack and Libyan policy.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama is accused of deception and cover-up regarding the Benghazi attack, knowing it was a terrorist act but falsely blaming it on protests. The administration's failure to acknowledge the threat of al Qaeda and its affiliates in Libya is criticized, with the article arguing that Obama's intervention in Libya has worsened the situation, enabling jihadist expansion. The consulate attack, which lasted over six hours, could have been prevented, but Obama refused to order a military response, prioritizing Libyan sovereignty over American lives. The article concludes that Obama's actions, including the systematic cover-up, make him unfit for office and deserve defeat. END OF SUMMARY.
