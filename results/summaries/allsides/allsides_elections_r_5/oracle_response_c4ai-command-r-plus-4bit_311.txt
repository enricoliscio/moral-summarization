SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a deception scandal that could hurt his re-election chances. Emails and cables reveal that the administration knowingly misled the public about the Benghazi attack, falsely claiming it was a response to protests and a video. Evidence shows that Mr. Obama knew it was a terrorist attack perpetrated by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, Ansar al-Sharia, yet he insisted on blaming a non-existent protest and a video. This cover-up was a desperate attempt to hide his administration's failure and maintain his campaign narrative of degrading al Qaeda. The truth is that al Qaeda is on the rise, and Libya, due to Mr. Obama's intervention, has become a safe haven for radical Islam. The attack on the Benghazi compound was an act of war, with jihadists invading American soil and shedding American blood. Mr. Obama's inaction and refusal to order a military response resulted in the murder of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans. The administration's willful blindness to the growing jihadist violence in Benghazi and denial of enhanced security requests led to the sacrifice of American lives. Mr. Obama systematically perpetrated a cover-up and manipulation campaign, which makes him unfit to be president.
