SUMMARY: President Obama has been accused of deception in the Libyagate scandal, eroding his credibility and trustworthiness. Evidence suggests that he misled the public about the Benghazi attack, insisting it was a spontaneous protest against a video when, in fact, it was a terrorist atrocity. The administration's cynical politics is exposed as it attempted to cover up its failure and protect its narrative of degrading al Qaeda. Mr. Obama's intervention in Libya has been a disaster, with jihadists targeting minorities and imposing Shariah law. The country has become a safe haven for radical Islam, and the president's multilateral interventionism and political ambitions have led to the sacrifice of American lives. The Benghazi attack was an act of war, with jihadists invading American soil and shedding American blood. Mr. Obama's refusal to order a military response and his systematic cover-up and manipulation campaign make him unfit to be president. He abandoned our personnel to be butchered by rampaging Islamists. The real tragedy is that the dead Americans could have been saved. END OF SUMMARY.
