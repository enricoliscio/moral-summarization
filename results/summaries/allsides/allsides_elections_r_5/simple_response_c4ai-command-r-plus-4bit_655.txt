SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a scandal, Libyagate, where emails and diplomatic cables reveal that his administration deceived the public about the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi. Despite knowing it was a terrorist attack by Ansar al-Sharia, an affiliate of al Qaeda, Obama claimed it was a spontaneous protest in response to an anti-Muslim video. This was a cynical political move to cover up his administration's failure and maintain the narrative that al Qaeda was in retreat. Obama's intervention in Libya has been a disaster, with the country becoming a failed Islamist state and the president's multilateral interventionism and political ambitions leading to the sacrifice of American lives. The Benghazi attack was an act of war against America, and Obama's refusal to order a military response and subsequent cover-up make him unfit to be president. He has American blood on his hands, and he deserves to be defeated in the upcoming election.
END OF SUMMARY.
