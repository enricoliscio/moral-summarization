Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is quite detailed and critical of Obama's handling of the Benghazi attack. I should focus on the key points: deception, the administration's cover-up, the failure to protect the consulate, and the broader implications for Obama's credibility and presidency.

First, the article mentions that emails and cables show the administration deceived the public, claiming the attack was a spontaneous protest when it was actually a terrorist act. I need to highlight that Obama knew it was a terrorist attack but misled the public to cover up the administration's failure.

Next, the article discusses the political motivations behind the cover-up. Obama's narrative of weakening al-Qaeda was contradicted by the attack, and Libya had become a haven for jihadists due to his intervention. This is an important point to include as it ties into the moral failure.

The article also details the failure to respond adequately, mentioning that military assets were nearby but not used because of concerns over Libyan sovereignty. This shows a lack of action and prioritization of political correctness over American lives.

Lastly, the author argues that Obama's actions make him unfit to be president, emphasizing the moral failure and the consequences of his decisions. I need to capture this sentiment in the summary.

I should structure the summary to flow from the deception, through the political motivations, to the failure to act, and conclude with the moral judgment against Obama. Keeping it under 200 words while covering all these points is crucial.

SUMMARY: The article accuses President Obama of deception and mismanagement regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, arguing that his administration misled the public by claiming the attack was a spontaneous protest rather than a terrorist act. Emails and testimonies reveal that the State Department and CIA knew Ansar al-Sharia, a jihadist group, was responsible, yet Obama falsely blamed an anti-Muslim video. The article criticizes Obama for failing to protect the consulate, noting that U.S. military assets were nearby but not deployed due to concerns over Libyan sovereignty. It argues that Obama's intervention in Libya enabled jihadist growth, making the country unsafe and leading to the attack. The article concludes that Obama's actions, including a cover-up and failure to act, demonstrate a moral failure and unfitness for office, deserving defeat in the election. END OF SUMMARY.
