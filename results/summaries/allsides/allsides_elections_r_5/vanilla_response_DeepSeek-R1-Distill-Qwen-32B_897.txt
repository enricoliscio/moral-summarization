Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama and the Benghazi attack. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about how Obama's administration allegedly misled the public regarding the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. It mentions that the administration initially claimed the attack was due to spontaneous protests, but evidence shows it was a terrorist act by Ansar al-Sharia, a group linked to al-Qaeda. Emails and cables indicate that the White House knew about the terrorist involvement early on but covered it up to protect their narrative about degrading al-Qaeda.

The article also discusses how Obama's military intervention in Libya led to the country becoming a safe haven for jihadists, which contributed to the attack. It criticizes Obama's inaction in responding to the attack, as military assets were nearby but not deployed. The piece argues that Obama's policies and decisions led to the deaths of American personnel and that he should be held accountable.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the deception, the terrorist nature of the attack, the administration's cover-up, the consequences of the Libya intervention, and the criticism of Obama's handling of the situation.

Let me structure the summary to include these elements, making sure it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start by stating the main issue, then outline the deception, the evidence, the implications, and the criticism. I'll avoid getting bogged down in too many details to keep it concise.
