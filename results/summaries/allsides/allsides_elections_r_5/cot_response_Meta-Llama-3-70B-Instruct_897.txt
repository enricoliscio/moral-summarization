SUMMARY:
President Obama has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, he insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, and Obama's cynical politics led to the tragic deaths of four Americans. His war in Libya has been a disaster, making the country safe for radical Islam. The administration engaged in willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi, sacrificing American lives on the altar of Obama's multilateral interventionism and political ambitions. Obama's refusal to order a military response and his subsequent cover-up make him unfit to be president. END OF SUMMARY.
