SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, Obama insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, with Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist group affiliated with al Qaeda, claiming responsibility just two hours after the assault began. The administration's cynical politics motivated this deception, as the truth would contradict Obama's campaign narrative that he killed Osama bin Laden and degraded al Qaeda. In reality, al Qaeda is on the rise, and Libya has been transformed into a failed Islamist state. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the murder of four U.S. diplomatic personnel, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Obama's refusal to order a military response, citing Libyan "sovereignty," abandoned our personnel to be butchered by rampaging Islamists. This act of war against America itself makes Obama unfit to be our president.
