Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone. The article is quite critical of President Obama, accusing him of deception regarding the Benghazi attack. It mentions that the administration misled the public, claiming the attack was due to protests, but it was actually a terrorist act. The author uses strong moral language, so I need to identify those words first.

Step 1: Identify morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a strong moral judgment. Words like "deception," "deceived," "haunts," "eroding," "false," "knew," "concluded," "bombshell," "cynical," "failure," "disaster," "sacrificed," "tragedy," "murdered," "blood on his hands," "atrocity," "butchered," "unfit." These words convey blame, wrongdoing, and moral failure.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into a concise version, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article's criticism against Obama. I'll structure it to highlight the deception, the cover-up, the consequences, and the moral judgment against the administration.

I should start by stating the main accusation: Obama's administration deceived the public about Benghazi. Then, mention the evidence they had about it being a terrorist attack but lied. Include the political motivations, the expansion of jihadist groups, the failed intervention, and the refusal to act to save the consulate. Conclude with the moral judgment that Obama is unfit.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, each sentence building on the previous one, while keeping it concise. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article and stick strictly to the facts and moral framing provided.

Let me draft the summary: Start with the deception, mention the emails and cables, the false claims, the evidence of a terrorist attack, the cover-up, the political spin, the failed intervention, the consequences, the refusal to act, and end with the moral judgment.

I think that covers all the key points. Now, I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. If it's over, I'll trim any unnecessary details but keep the moral words intact.

**SUMMARY:**  

President Obama is accused of deception and misleading the public about the Benghazi attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest instead of a terrorist act. Evidence shows the administration knew it was a terrorist attack but lied to cover up their failure. The attack was carried out by Ansar al-Sharia, a group linked to al Qaeda, and the State Department sent an email to the White House confirming this. Obama's administration allegedly manipulated the narrative to protect their political agenda, including the false claim that al Qaeda was in retreat. The article argues that Obama's intervention in Libya has failed, leading to a surge in jihadist activity and making the country a safe haven for radical Islam. The author criticizes Obama for not responding to the attack, sacrificing American lives, and blames him for the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three others. The article concludes that Obama's actions make him unfit to be president.
