SUMMARY:

President Obama has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, he insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, with Ansar al-Sharia claiming responsibility just two hours after it began. The administration's cynical politics led to the tragic event, as Obama's Libyan intervention has made the country safe for radical Islam. The president's war has resulted in American blood being shed, with Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. diplomatic personnel being murdered. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the tragedy, with repeated requests for enhanced security being denied. The attack was an act of war against America itself, and Obama's refusal to order a military response makes him unfit to be president.

END OF SUMMARY.
