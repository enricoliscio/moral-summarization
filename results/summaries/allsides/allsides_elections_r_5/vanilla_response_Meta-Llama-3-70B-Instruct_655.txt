SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, which threatens to harm his re-election bid. Despite knowing the truth, the administration claimed the attack resulted from "spontaneous protests" in response to an anti-Muslim video. However, senior State Department officials testified that there were no protests, and the State Department was monitoring the compound in real-time. An email sent to the White House Situation Room two hours after the attack began revealed that Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist group affiliated with al Qaeda, had claimed responsibility. The administration's motivation for the cover-up was to conceal their failure to prevent the attack and to maintain the narrative that al Qaeda was in retreat. In reality, al Qaeda has been expanding its safe havens and jihadist activity in several countries, including Libya, which has become a failed Islamist state.
