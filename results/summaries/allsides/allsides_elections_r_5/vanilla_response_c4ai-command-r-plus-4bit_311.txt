SUMMARY: President Obama's re-election campaign is facing scrutiny over the administration's handling of the Benghazi attack. Emails and testimony reveal that the administration knew the attack was a premeditated terrorist act, despite initially blaming it on spontaneous protests and a controversial video. The attack highlights the rise of al Qaeda and the failure of Obama's intervention in Libya, which has led to a surge in jihadist activity and the proliferation of weapons. The administration's failure to provide adequate security and respond to the attack has resulted in the deaths of American diplomatic personnel. The article argues that Obama prioritized his political ambitions over American lives and engaged in a cover-up to mislead the public, which warrants his defeat in the upcoming election.
