Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first to understand the context. It's about President Obama and the Benghazi attack, where the administration is accused of deception. The author uses strong moral terms like "deception," "terrorist attack," and "cover-up." 

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll identify the main points: the administration's deception, the terrorist nature of the attack, the cover-up, and the failure to protect the consulate. I should include words like "deception," "terrorist," "cover-up," "atrocity," and "failure." 

I'll structure the summary to highlight that Obama knew about the attack's nature but misled the public. Also, mention the refusal to act to protect the consulate due to political reasons, leading to American deaths. 

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the deception, then the facts about the attack, the cover-up, and the consequences. I'll make sure to use the key moral terms without making the summary too lengthy.

Let me draft a version and check the word count. I'll make sure each sentence contributes to the moral framing and sticks to the facts presented in the article. 

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all important points are covered and that the moral language is preserved effectively. That should meet the user's requirements.

SUMMARY: President Obama is accused of deception and misleading the public regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which he initially blamed on "spontaneous protests" caused by an anti-Muslim video. However, evidence revealed it was a terrorist assault by Ansar al-Sharia, a group affiliated with al Qaeda. Despite knowing the truth, Obama persisted in blaming a phantom protest to cover up his administration's failure. The article highlights the administration's cynical politics, as Obama's narrative of degrading al Qaeda was contradicted by the attack, which demonstrated the group's rise and expansion in Libya. The failure to secure the consulate and the refusal to order a military response, despite the presence of U.S. forces nearby, led to the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others. The author argues that Obama's intervention in Libya created a safe haven for radicals, making the attack possible. The administration's willful blindness and refusal to act left American personnel vulnerable, resulting in a tragic atrocity. The article concludes that Obama's cover-up and manipulation make him unfit to lead, deserving defeat for his failure to protect American lives. END OF SUMMARY.
