Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is quite detailed and has a strong tone against Obama's handling of the Benghazi attack. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author accuses Obama of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, claiming it was a terrorist act, not a spontaneous protest. They mention that the administration knew it was a terrorist attack but lied to the public to cover up their failure. 

The article also discusses the broader implications, like Obama's foreign policy and the expansion of al-Qaeda in various regions. It's critical of his intervention in Libya, suggesting it made the country a safe haven for radicals, leading to the attack. The author argues that Obama's refusal to send military aid to the consulate was a failure, resulting in the deaths of American personnel.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll start by stating the main accusation: Obama's administration misled the public about the attack's nature. Then, mention the evidence, like the email to the White House. Highlight the failure to protect the consulate despite knowing it was a terrorist act. Also, touch on the political motivation and the consequences of the administration's policies in Libya.

I should keep the moral tone intact, emphasizing the deception, the cover-up, and the resulting tragedy. I'll make sure to include key details without going into too much depth, keeping it concise.

Let me structure the summary: start with the accusation, then the evidence, the cover-up, the political reasons, the failure to act, and the consequences. Make sure each sentence flows logically to the next, maintaining the critical perspective of the original article.

I need to be careful with word choice to keep it under 200 words. Maybe combine some points where possible. For example, mention the failed policies and their impact on Libya's stability in one sentence.

Finally, ensure that the summary ends by tying the moral failing to Obama's fitness for office, as the original article does. That should cover all the necessary points while preserving the author's framing.
