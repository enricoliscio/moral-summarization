SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, which threatens to harm his re-election bid. Despite knowing the truth, Obama claimed the attack resulted from "spontaneous protests" in response to an anti-Muslim video. However, emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the administration knew it was a terrorist attack by Ansar al-Sharia, a group affiliated with al Qaeda, from the beginning. The attack was a result of Obama's failed Libyan intervention, which has turned the country into a failed Islamist state. The administration's failure to provide adequate security and respond to the attack in a timely manner led to the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The article argues that Obama's actions were motivated by cynical politics and a desire to cover up his administration's failures. As a result, Obama is unfit to be president and deserves to be defeated in November.
