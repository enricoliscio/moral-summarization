SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a web of deception that may hurt his re-election bid. Emails and cables reveal that he deceived the public about the Benghazi attack, insisting it was a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video. In reality, it was a terrorist assault perpetrated by jihadists. The State Department and the CIA knew this within 24 hours of the attack, and an email sent to the White House Situation Room two hours after the breach confirmed that Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, had claimed responsibility. Despite this knowledge, Mr. Obama misled the public to cover up his administration's failure. This cynical politics puts his political ambitions above American lives, as the attack resulted in the murder of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other diplomatic personnel. The administration ignored previous attacks on the consulate and requests for enhanced security, sacrificing American lives on the altar of Mr. Obama's interventionism. Mr. Obama also refused to order a military response during the attack, citing respect for Libyan sovereignty. This systematic cover-up and manipulation campaign show that Mr. Obama is unfit to be president and deserves to be defeated in the upcoming election.
END OF SUMMARY.
