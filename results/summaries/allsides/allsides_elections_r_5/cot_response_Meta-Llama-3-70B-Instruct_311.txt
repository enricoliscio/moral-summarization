SUMMARY:
President Obama has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, he insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, and Obama's cynical politics led to the murder of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The president's war in Libya has been a disaster, making the country safe for radical Islam and allowing jihadists to roam free. Obama's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the tragedy, and his refusal to order a military response was an act of war against America itself. He is unfit to be our president. END OF SUMMARY.
