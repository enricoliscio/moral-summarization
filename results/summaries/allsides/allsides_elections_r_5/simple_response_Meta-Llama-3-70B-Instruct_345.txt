SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, deliberately misleading the public about the true nature of the incident. Despite knowing that the attack was a terrorist assault, Obama insisted on blaming a spontaneous protest and an anti-Muslim video. This deception was motivated by cynical politics, as the truth would have contradicted his campaign narrative that al Qaeda was in retreat. In reality, al Qaeda has been expanding its safe havens and jihadist activity in several countries, including Libya, which has become a failed Islamist state. The Benghazi attack was a direct result of Obama's military intervention in Libya, which has made the country safe for radical Islam. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the murder of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. diplomatic personnel. Obama's refusal to order a military response and subsequent cover-up make him unfit to be president.
