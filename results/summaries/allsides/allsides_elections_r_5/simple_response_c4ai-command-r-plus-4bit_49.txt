SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a web of deception that stains his integrity and calls into question his fitness for office. Emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the Obama administration deliberately misled the public about the Benghazi attack, falsely attributing it to "spontaneous protests" and an anti-Muslim video. Evidence shows that the State Department and the CIA knew it was a terrorist attack by Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group. Mr. Obama's deception was motivated by cynical politics: to maintain the narrative that al-Qaeda was in retreat and to cover up his administration's failure in Libya, where his intervention has led to a failed Islamist state. The result of this deception was the murder of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Mr. Obama's inaction during the attack, due to his concern for Libyan sovereignty, amounts to a betrayal of American lives and soil. The Benghazi atrocity was an act of war, and Mr. Obama's cover-up and manipulation campaign make him unfit to lead the nation. He must be defeated in the upcoming election to uphold moral standards and hold him accountable for his actions. END OF SUMMARY.
