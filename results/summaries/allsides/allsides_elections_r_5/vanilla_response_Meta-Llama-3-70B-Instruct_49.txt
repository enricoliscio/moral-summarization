SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, which threatens his re-election bid. Despite knowing the truth, Obama blamed the attack on a spontaneous protest sparked by an anti-Muslim video, when in fact it was a terrorist assault. Emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the State Department knew Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist group affiliated with al Qaeda, had claimed responsibility for the attack. Obama's motive for the cover-up was to protect his campaign narrative that he had degraded al Qaeda, when in reality the group is on the rise. The Benghazi attack was a result of Obama's failed military intervention in Libya, which has made the country safe for radical Islam. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the deaths of four American diplomats, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Obama's inaction during the attack and subsequent cover-up make him unfit to be president.
