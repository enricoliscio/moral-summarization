SUMMARY: Emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the Obama administration was aware that the 2012 Benghazi attack was a premeditated terrorist act by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group but falsely attributed it to spontaneous protests and a controversial video. This deception was aimed at concealing the administration's failure and preserving Obama's narrative of degrading al-Qaeda. The attack highlighted the rise of al-Qaeda and the instability in Libya, where jihadists were gaining power and targeting minorities. Despite warnings and requests for enhanced security, Obama refused to take decisive military action, resulting in the deaths of American diplomatic personnel. The attack was an act of war, yet Obama chose to mislead the public and cover up the truth, putting his political ambitions above American lives. This scandal, known as Libyagate, has severely damaged Obama's credibility and calls into question his fitness for the presidency.
