Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama and the Benghazi attack. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about how Obama's administration allegedly deceived the public regarding the Benghazi attack. They initially claimed it was a spontaneous protest, but evidence shows it was a terrorist attack. Emails and cables reveal that the State Department knew it was Ansar al-Sharia, linked to al-Qaeda, who were responsible. The administration didn't act to protect the consulate, leading to the deaths of four Americans. The article criticizes Obama's foreign policy in Libya, suggesting it enabled jihadists. The main points are deception, failure to protect, and political cover-up.

I need to condense this into a clear, concise summary. I'll mention the deception, the terrorist group, the administration's knowledge, failure to respond, and the political implications. Keep it under 200 words, using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

Make sure to highlight the key points: the initial false claims, the evidence showing it was a terrorist attack, the administration's cover-up, the consequences, and the criticism of Obama's policies leading to the attack. Avoid getting bogged down in every detail, focus on the main narrative.
