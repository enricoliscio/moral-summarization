SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, Obama insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, with Ansar al-Sharia claiming responsibility just two hours after it began. Obama's cynical politics drove his deception, as the attack contradicted his campaign narrative that al Qaeda was in retreat. In reality, al Qaeda is on the rise, and Libya has been transformed into a failed Islamist state. Obama's military intervention in Libya has been a disaster, making the country safe for radical Islam. The result is that Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. diplomatic personnel were murdered, with American blood on Obama's hands. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the tragedy, and Obama's refusal to order a military response made him unfit to be president.
