Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is pretty critical of Obama, so I need to make sure the summary reflects that tone. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Benghazi attack, how the administration initially blamed it on protests, but it was actually a terrorist act. The emails and cables show the administration knew it was a terrorist attack but covered it up. 

I need to highlight the deception and the cover-up, as that's the moral issue here. The article also connects this to Obama's foreign policy failures in Libya, leading to more jihadist activity. 

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the attack, the initial false claims, the emails showing awareness of the terrorist group's involvement, the cover-up, and the consequences like the loss of American lives. Also, mention how it undermines Obama's credibility and his campaign narrative about fighting terrorism.

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all critical elements. I'll start by stating the administration's deception, then the facts that contradict their claims, the cover-up, and the implications. 

Make sure the summary flows logically and maintains the critical tone. Avoid any neutral language since the original article is quite harsh. 

Let me draft it, ensuring each sentence adds value and sticks to the main points without unnecessary details. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. 

Finally, I'll review to ensure the moral framing is preserved, emphasizing the administration's deceit and the negative outcomes for American credibility and lives.

SUMMARY: The article accuses the Obama administration of deliberately deceiving the public regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest rather than a terrorist assault. Emails and cables reveal that senior officials, including the president, knew the attack was carried out by Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda. The administration's cover-up is seen as an attempt to protect Obama's narrative of weakening al Qaeda, despite evidence of its resurgence in Libya and other regions. The article criticizes Obama's foreign policy, arguing that his intervention in Libya created a safe haven for jihadists, leading to the consulate attack. The failure to provide adequate security or a military response is portrayed as a tragic consequence of Obama's political ambitions and disregard for American lives. The piece concludes that Obama's actions, including the cover-up, make him unfit for office. END OF SUMMARY.
