SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a deception scandal that could hurt his re-election chances. Emails and cables reveal that the administration knowingly misled the public about the Benghazi attack, falsely blaming it on protests and a video. Evidence shows that the State Department and the CIA knew it was a terrorist attack perpetrated by jihadists affiliated with al Qaeda. Mr. Obama's team covered up the truth to protect his campaign narrative of degrading al Qaeda, while the reality is that jihadists are expanding their safe havens and Libya, in particular, has become a failed Islamist state. The administration ignored previous attacks on the consulate and denied requests for enhanced security, resulting in the sacrifice of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans. Mr. Obama did not order a military response during the six-hour attack and refused to violate Libyan sovereignty, abandoning our personnel to be butchered by Islamists. This act of war against America and the subsequent cover-up show Mr. Obama is unfit to be president.
END OF SUMMARY.
