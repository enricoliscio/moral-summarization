SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a web of deception that may derail his re-election bid. Emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the administration deliberately deceived the public about the Benghazi attack, falsely claiming it was a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video. Evidence shows that Mr. Obama knew it was a terrorist attack perpetrated by jihadists. The president misled the public in a desperate attempt to cover up his administrationâ€™s failure and preserve his cynical political narrative of degrading al Qaeda. Libya has become a safe haven for radical Islam, with jihadists roaming the countryside, imposing Sharia law, and stealing weapons. The Benghazi attack was a result of Mr. Obama's interventionist policies, and he withheld military aid during the assault, sacrificing American lives on the altar of his political ambitions. Mr. Obama's deception, cover-up, and manipulation are unfit for a president and warrant his defeat in the upcoming election. END OF SUMMARY.
