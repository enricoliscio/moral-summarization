SUMMARY:

President Obama has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, he insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, with Ansar al-Sharia claiming responsibility just two hours after it began. The president's cynical politics motivated the deception, as the truth would contradict his campaign narrative that al Qaeda is in retreat. In reality, al Qaeda is on the rise, and Libya has been transformed into a failed Islamist state. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the murder of four U.S. diplomatic personnel, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The president's inaction during the six-hour attack, refusing to order a military response, is a stark example of his failure to defend American lives and sovereignty. His cover-up and manipulation campaign render him unfit to be president.
