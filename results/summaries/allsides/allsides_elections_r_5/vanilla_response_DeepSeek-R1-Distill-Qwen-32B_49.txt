Okay, I need to summarize the given article about President Obama and the Benghazi attack. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should be returned after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about how Obama's administration allegedly deceived the public regarding the Benghazi attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest when it was actually a terrorist attack by Ansar al-Sharia. Emails and cables show the administration knew about the terrorist group's involvement early on but misled the public to cover up their failures.

The article also discusses how Obama's foreign policy in Libya led to the country becoming a safe haven for jihadists, which contributed to the attack. The administration ignored security requests and didn't respond militarily to protect the consulate, resulting in the deaths of four Americans.

I need to capture these key points: the deception, the terrorist group's role, the administration's knowledge, the failure to act, and the consequences. I'll make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. I'll structure it to highlight the main accusations without getting bogged down in too many details.

I should start by stating the main issue: the administration's alleged deception. Then mention the terrorist group and the emails showing their awareness. Next, explain the consequences of the administration's actions, including the lack of response and the loss of life. Finally, conclude with the political implications and the call for Obama's defeat.

I'll need to keep each sentence concise and avoid jargon. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll check the word count after drafting to make sure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The article accuses President Obama of deceiving the public regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest when it was actually a terrorist assault by Ansar al-Sharia, a group linked to al-Qaeda. Emails and cables reveal the administration knew of the terrorist involvement early on but misled the public to cover up failures. The article argues that Obama's intervention in Libya, which led to the country becoming a haven for jihadists, directly contributed to the attack. Despite requests for enhanced security, the consulate was left vulnerable, and a military response was delayed due to concerns over Libyan sovereignty. The article concludes that Obama's actions, including the cover-up, make him unfit for office and deserving of defeat. END OF SUMMARY.
