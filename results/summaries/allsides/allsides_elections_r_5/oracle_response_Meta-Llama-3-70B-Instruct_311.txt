SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, Obama insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, with Ansar al-Sharia claiming responsibility just two hours after it began. Obama's cynical politics motivated the cover-up, as the truth would contradict his campaign narrative that al Qaeda is in retreat. In reality, al Qaeda is on the rise, and Libya has been transformed into a failed Islamist state. The Benghazi attack was a direct result of Obama's military intervention, which made Libya safe for radical Islam. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the murder of four U.S. diplomatic personnel, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Obama's refusal to order a military response, citing Libyan "sovereignty," abandoned American personnel to be butchered by rampaging Islamists. The Benghazi atrocity was an act of war against America, and Obama's actions make him unfit to be president.
