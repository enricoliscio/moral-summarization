SUMMARY: President Obama's re-election bid is threatened by revelations that his administration deceived the public about the Benghazi attack. Emails and cables show that the administration knew the attack was a premeditated terrorist act by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, Ansar al-Sharia, but falsely blamed it on spontaneous protests and a video. This was done to cover up the administration's failure and to maintain the narrative that al-Qaeda was degraded. The truth is that Libya has become a failed state, with jihadists roaming free and al-Qaeda gaining strength. The attack could have been prevented, but Obama did nothing due to concerns about Libyan sovereignty. This was not an isolated incident, as previous attacks on the consulate had been ignored, and security requests denied. Obama's inaction and cover-up amount to an unfit president who deserves to be defeated in the upcoming election. 

END OF SUMMARY.
