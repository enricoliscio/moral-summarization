SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a web of deception that may hurt his re-election bid. Evidence reveals that the administration knowingly deceived the public about the nature of the Benghazi attack, which was a terrorist assault. Emails and testimonies show that the Obama team falsely claimed the attack resulted from spontaneous protests and blamed it on an anti-Muslim video, despite knowing it was a premeditated terrorist attack. The real motive behind the cover-up was cynical politics: to maintain the narrative that al Qaeda was in retreat and to hide the failure of his Libyan intervention, which had made Libya safe for radical Islam. The administration ignored previous attacks on the consulate and denied requests for enhanced security, leading to the sacrifice of American lives. Mr. Obama did not order a military response during the six-hour attack and refused to violate Libyan sovereignty, effectively abandoning our personnel to be butchered. This act of war against America and the subsequent cover-up and manipulation campaign demonstrate Mr. Obama's unfitness for the presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
