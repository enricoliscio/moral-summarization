SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, which threatens to harm his re-election bid. Despite knowing the truth, Obama claimed the attack was a "spontaneous protest" in response to an anti-Muslim video, when in fact it was a terrorist assault. Emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the State Department was monitoring the compound in real-time and witnessed the attack, and the CIA's station chief in Libya reported that jihadists perpetrated the attack. The administration's motive for the cover-up was to conceal the failure of Obama's Libyan intervention, which has led to the rise of al Qaeda and the transformation of Libya into a failed Islamist state. The article argues that Obama's actions led to the death of four American diplomats and that he is unfit to be president.
