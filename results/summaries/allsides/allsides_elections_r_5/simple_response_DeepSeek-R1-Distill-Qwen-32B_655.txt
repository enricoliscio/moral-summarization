Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone.

The article talks about President Obama and the Benghazi attack. It says that the administration misled the public by claiming it was a spontaneous protest when it was actually a terrorist attack. They knew about Ansar al-Sharia's involvement early on but blamed it on an anti-Muslim video instead. The author is critical, saying Obama's policies in Libya led to the country becoming a safe haven for jihadists, which caused the attack. They also mention that the administration didn't respond militarily because they didn't want to violate Libyan sovereignty, leading to the deaths of diplomats.

I need to make sure the summary captures the deception, the cover-up, the failure in Libya, and the moral judgment against Obama. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points without adding my own opinions.

Let me outline the main points:
1. Obama administration misled the public about the Benghazi attack, blaming a protest instead of acknowledging it as a terrorist act.
2. Emails and cables show the administration knew it was a terrorist attack but covered it up.
3. The attack was due to Obama's failed intervention in Libya, which allowed jihadists to operate.
4. The administration didn't send help because of sovereignty concerns, leading to the deaths.
5. The author argues Obama is unfit due to this cover-up and policy failures.

Now, I'll craft a summary that includes these points in a clear, concise manner, preserving the critical tone.
