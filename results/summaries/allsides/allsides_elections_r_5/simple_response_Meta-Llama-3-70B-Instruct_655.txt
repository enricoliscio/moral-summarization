SUMMARY:

President Obama has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, deliberately misleading the public about the true nature of the event. Despite knowing that the attack was a terrorist atrocity, Obama insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video. The administration's central campaign narrative that al Qaeda is in retreat is contradicted by the Benghazi attack, which reveals that al Qaeda is actually on the rise. The Obama administration's military intervention in Libya has been a disaster, creating a failed Islamist state where jihadists roam free. The Benghazi attack was a result of Obama's war, which made Libya safe for radical Islam. The president's refusal to order a military response and subsequent cover-up make him unfit to be president. The blood of four American diplomats is on his hands, and he deserves to be defeated in November.
