Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about President Obama and the Benghazi attack. It accuses him of deception regarding the incident. The author uses strong moral terms like "deception," "terrorist," "cover-up," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, the main points are that Obama's administration misled the public about the attack, claiming it was a spontaneous protest when it was actually a terrorist act. They knew about Ansar al-Sharia's involvement early on but covered it up. The article also criticizes Obama's Libyan intervention, saying it led to the rise of jihadists, making Libya unsafe.

I should structure the summary to include these points, using the moral words. I'll start by stating the administration's deception, mention the terrorist group, the cover-up, and the consequences like the loss of lives. Then, I'll touch on the failed intervention and the broader implications.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Let me make sure to include all the key moral terms without making the summary too long. I'll also ensure the flow logically from deception to the attack details, then to the intervention failure, and finally the call for Obama's defeat.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include words like "deception," "terrorist," "cover-up," "failure," "murdered," etc. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll review to ensure it captures the moral framing accurately.

SUMMARY:  
The article accuses President Obama of deception and failure in handling the 2012 Benghazi attack, which was a terrorist assault by Ansar al-Sharia, a group linked to al Qaeda. Despite knowing the truth, Obama falsely blamed it on a protest and an anti-Muslim video, misleading the public to cover up the administration's failure. The attack, which resulted in the murder of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others, was not spontaneous but part of a broader jihadist surge in Libya, fueled by Obama's intervention. The administration ignored warnings and denied requests for enhanced security, sacrificing embassy personnel. A U.S. drone monitored the attack, and military assets were nearby, but Obama refused to order a response, prioritizing Libyan sovereignty over American lives. The article frames this as a tragedy of Obama's interventionism, arguing his policies enabled radical Islam and failed to protect U.S. interests. The author concludes Obama's actions, including the cover-up and manipulation, make him unfit for office.  
END OF SUMMARY.
