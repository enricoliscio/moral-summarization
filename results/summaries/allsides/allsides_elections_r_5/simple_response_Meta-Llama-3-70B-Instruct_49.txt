SUMMARY:

President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, deliberately misleading the public about the true nature of the incident. Despite knowing that the attack was a terrorist assault, Obama blamed a spontaneous protest and an anti-Muslim video, covering up his administration's failure. The real reason behind the cover-up is cynical politics, as the attack contradicts Obama's campaign narrative that he killed Osama bin Laden and degraded al Qaeda. In reality, al Qaeda is on the rise, and Obama's military intervention in Libya has been a disaster, creating a failed Islamist state. The Benghazi attack occurred due to Obama's war making Libya safe for radical Islam. The administration's willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the murder of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. diplomatic personnel. Obama's inaction during the attack, prioritizing Libyan sovereignty over American lives, makes him unfit to be president.
