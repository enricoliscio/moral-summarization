SUMMARY:
President Obama's administration has been caught in a web of deception, deliberately misleading the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing the truth, Obama insisted on blaming a phantom protest and an obscure YouTube video, covering up his administration's colossal failure. The attack was a terrorist atrocity, and Obama's cynical politics led to the tragic deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The president's war in Libya has made the country safe for radical Islam, and his willful blindness to the Islamist reality in Benghazi led to the tragedy. Obama's refusal to order a military response and his subsequent cover-up make him unfit to be president. His administration's failures have American blood on their hands, and the Benghazi atrocity was an act of war against America itself. END OF SUMMARY.
