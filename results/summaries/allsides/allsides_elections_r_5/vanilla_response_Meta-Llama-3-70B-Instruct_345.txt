SUMMARY:

The Obama administration has been caught in a web of deception regarding the Benghazi attack, which threatens to harm his re-election bid. Emails and diplomatic cables reveal that the administration deliberately misled the public, claiming the attack resulted from "spontaneous protests" in response to an anti-Muslim video. However, senior State Department officials testified that there were no protests, and the State Department was monitoring the compound in real-time, witnessing the terrorist assault. The CIA's station chief in Libya also reported that jihadists perpetrated the attack. The administration knew the truth but insisted on blaming the video to cover up their failure. The Benghazi attack contradicts the administration's position that al Qaeda is in retreat, and instead, it has been expanding its safe havens and jihadist activity in several countries. The president's inaction during the attack, prioritizing Libyan "sovereignty" over American lives, makes him unfit to be president.
