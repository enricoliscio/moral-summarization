SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a scandal, Libyagate, where emails and diplomatic cables reveal that his administration deliberately deceived the public about the Benghazi attack. Despite knowing it was a terrorist attack by Ansar al-Sharia, affiliated with al Qaeda, Obama blamed it on protests and a YouTube video. This was a cynical political move to cover up his administration's failure and maintain the narrative that al Qaeda was degraded. Obama's intervention in Libya has been a disaster, with the country becoming a failed Islamist state and jihadists targeting minorities and seeking to impose Shariah law. The attack on the US compound, which resulted in the murder of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, was an act of war. Obama's refusal to order a military response and his subsequent cover-up demonstrate his unfitness for presidency and justify his defeat in the upcoming election. His inaction led to the sacrifice of American lives, as a massive, rapid response could have potentially saved the victims. Obama put his political ambitions above American lives, and his deceit and manipulation are a stain on his presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
