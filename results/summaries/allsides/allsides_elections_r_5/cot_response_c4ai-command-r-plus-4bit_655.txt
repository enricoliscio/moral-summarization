SUMMARY: President Obama has been caught in a web of deception that may ensnarl his re-election bid. Emails and cables reveal that the administration deliberately deceived the public about the Benghazi attack, which directly contradicts Obama's claims of degrading al Qaeda. Evidence shows that the White House knew the attack was perpetrated by jihadists affiliated with al Qaeda, yet they falsely blamed it on protests and a YouTube video. This manipulation was a cynical attempt to cover up the administration's colossal failure in Libya, where Obama's intervention has led to a disaster. The country has become a safe haven for radical Islam, with jihadists targeting minorities and stealing weapons. The real tragedy is that the attack, which lasted over six hours, could have been prevented. American lives were sacrificed and butchered by rampaging Islamists, and Mr. Obama refused to order a military response, systematically perpetrating a cover-up. For this cynical manipulation and deception, he deserves to be defeated in the upcoming election. He is unfit to be our president. END OF SUMMARY.
