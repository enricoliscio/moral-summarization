Okay, I need to summarize this news article about a shooting in Springfield, Mo. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the shooting happened on March 15, 2020, at a gas station. Police Chief Paul Williams provided details. The gunman fired randomly from his vehicle, moving through the city, then crashed into a Kum & Go store. Inside, he shot five people, including a police officer and himself. The dead were a store employee, two men in the store, the officer, and the gunman. Another officer was injured, along with another person.

The gunman's motives are unclear. The police received multiple shooting reports, indicating he was an active shooter moving through the city. When he crashed into the store, he started shooting. Officers arriving were shot, and others had to take cover. The first two officers were shot, then others pulled them out and found three dead inside. The gunman died from a self-inflicted wound.

The shooter was identified as Joaquin S. Roman, 31. Officer Christopher Walsh, 32, was killed while trying to rescue a victim. He was an Army veteran and left a wife and daughter. Another officer, Josiah Overton, was injured but not critically.

A witness, Casey Parrish, saw the gunman firing at her as she drove home. She heard shots, saw muzzle flashes, but wasn't hit. She called 911 and was told others were reporting similar incidents.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should include the main facts: the shooting incident, the gunman's actions, casualties, the officers' bravery, and the impact on the community.

I'll structure it by mentioning the date, location, the gunman's actions, the number of dead and injured, the officers involved, their backgrounds, and the witness account. I'll keep it clear and factual without unnecessary details.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure to cover all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200 words.
