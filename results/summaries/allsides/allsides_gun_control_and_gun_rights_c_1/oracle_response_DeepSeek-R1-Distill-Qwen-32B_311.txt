Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about a shooting incident in Springfield, Mo, where a gunman killed several people, including a police officer, before dying himself. 

The author used words like "shooting," "killed," "fired," "opened fire," "dead," "injured," "shot," "rescue," "died," "rushing," "protect," "actions," "injuries," "shock," "sorrow," "shots," and "loss." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key events: the gunman fired randomly from his car, crashed into a gas station, entered the store, and killed five people, including himself and an officer. The police responded, and two officers were injured, one fatally. The article also mentions the impact on the community and the bravery of the officers.

I need to structure the summary to include all these elements, using the morally charged words. I should mention the number of deaths, the injured, the gunman's actions, the police's response, and the emotional impact. I also need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with the incident, mention the gunman's actions, the victims, the police response, the injured officers, the emotional impact, and the community's reaction. Make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral framing.
