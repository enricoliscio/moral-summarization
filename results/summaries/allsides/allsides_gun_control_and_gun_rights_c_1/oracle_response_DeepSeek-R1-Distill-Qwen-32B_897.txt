Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. A gunman went on a shooting spree in Springfield, killing several people including a police officer. The police responded courageously, and there's a lot of emphasis on the tragedy and heroism.

I should start by identifying the key events: the shooting, the number of deaths, the injured, the gunman's actions, and the police response. I need to use words like "killed," "fired," "dead," "injured," "shot," "rescue," "died," "protect," "actions," "loss," "shock," "sorrow."

I'll structure the summary to highlight the tragedy and the heroic actions of the officers. I should mention the victims and the gunman's identity. I'll also include the emotional impact on the community and the police department.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it concise, focusing on the moral elements. I'll check each sentence to ensure it includes the necessary framed words without overcrowding.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the essence of the article and the moral framing intended by the author.
