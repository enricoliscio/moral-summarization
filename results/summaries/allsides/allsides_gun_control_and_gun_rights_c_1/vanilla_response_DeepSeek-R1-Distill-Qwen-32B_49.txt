Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about a shooting in Springfield, Mo. They specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it needs to be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The shooting happened on March 15, 2020, at a gas station. A gunman fired randomly from his car, moving through the city, then crashed into a convenience store. He killed five people, including a police officer and himself. The victims were a store employee, two customers, and the officer. Another officer and a civilian were injured.

I need to capture the key details: when, where, who was involved, what happened, and the consequences. I should mention the gunman's name, Joaquin S. Roman, and the police officer Christopher Walsh, highlighting his heroism. Also, note the other victims and the impact on the community.

I should keep the summary concise, making sure to include all important elements without going over 200 words. I'll structure it to start with the event, then the gunman's actions, the casualties, the officers' bravery, and the aftermath.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.
