Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article is about a shooting incident in Springfield, Mo, where a gunman killed several people, including a police officer. The police chief, Paul Williams, provided details about the incident. The gunman fired randomly from his vehicle, crashed into a convenience store, and then opened fire inside, resulting in five deaths. The gunman also died from a self-inflicted wound. 

I notice the author uses words like "shooting," "killed," "fired," "opened," "dead," "injured," "shot," "rescue," "died," "rushing," "protect," "actions," "injuries," "shock," "sorrow," "shots," and "loss." These words carry moral weight, so I need to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

I should start by identifying the main events: the gunman's actions, the police response, the casualties, and the impact on the community. I need to mention the names of the victims and the officers involved, as they add a personal touch and highlight the tragedy.

I should also include the police chief's statement about the officers' bravery and the community's shock and sorrow. It's important to convey the heroism of the officers who rushed to protect others, even at the cost of their lives.

I'll structure the summary to first describe the gunman's actions, then the police response, followed by the casualties, and end with the community's reaction. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the tone set by the author.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll need to be concise but include all the essential details. I'll avoid any unnecessary information to keep the summary tight.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the user's request. I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the moral framing of the original article.
