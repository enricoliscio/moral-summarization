Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what moral framing means. It's about the language used to convey values or judgments, like heroism, bravery, or sorrow. 

Looking at the article, there are several words that carry moral weight. I'll start by identifying those. Words like "randomly," "roving," "hero," "courageous," "bravery," "sorrow," "grateful," "surreal," "normal," and "grieving" stand out. These words aren't just factual; they carry emotional or evaluative meanings.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these morally framed words. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key events: the shooter's actions, the casualties, the officers' bravery, and the community's reaction.

I should structure the summary to highlight the gunman's random actions, the officers' heroic efforts, and the impact on the community. Including details about the injured officer and the victims adds depth. Also, mentioning the shooter's self-inflicted death and the department's grief wraps up the summary effectively.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use words like "hero," "courageous," and "sorrow" as they appear in the original text. This will maintain the author's intended emotional tone.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and covers all critical points without exceeding the word limit. I'll double-check to include all identified moral words and ensure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone.
