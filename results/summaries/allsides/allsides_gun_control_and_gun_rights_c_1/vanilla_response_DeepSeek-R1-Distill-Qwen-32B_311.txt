Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about a shooting in Springfield, Mo. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that police responded to a shooting at a gas station on March 15, 2020. The police chief, Paul Williams, reported that an officer, three citizens, and the gunman were killed. 

The gunman fired randomly from his vehicle, driving through the city, then crashed into a convenience store. Inside, he opened fire, killing five people, including the police officer and himself. The dead include a store employee and two men in the store. Another officer was injured, along with another person.

The gunman's motives are unclear. Police received multiple shooting reports, starting in the south and moving north. The gunman crashed into the Kum & Go store, then began shooting as police arrived. Officers took cover, and the first two officers were shot. Others pulled them out and found three dead, including the gunman, who died from a self-inflicted wound.

The shooter was identified as Joaquin S. Roman, 31. Officer Christopher Walsh, 32, was killed trying to rescue a victim. He was an Army veteran and leaves a wife and daughter. Williams praised Walsh as a hero. The other dead were Troy Rapp, Shannon Perkins, and Matthew Hicks-Morris, all from Springfield. Officer Josiah Overton was injured but not life-threateningly.

Kum & Go's spokesman expressed shock and gratitude for first responders. A witness, Casey Parrish, said the gunman fired at her car but didn't hit her. She called 911, and others had reported similar incidents.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points: the shooting incident, the gunman's actions, casualties, the officer's heroism, and the aftermath.

I should structure it to cover the main events: the gunman's rampage, the crash, the deaths, the injured, the identification of the gunman and victims, the officers' bravery, and the community's reaction.

I need to make sure to include all the essential details without going over the word limit. I'll start by stating the incident, then the gunman's actions, the casualties, the officers' roles, and the aftermath.

Let me draft the summary:

A gunman drove through Springfield, Mo., firing randomly, crashing into a convenience store, and killing five people, including himself and an officer. The victims were a store employee and two customers. Another officer and a bystander were injured. The gunman's motives remain unclear. Officer Christopher Walsh was killed while rescuing a victim; he was praised as a hero. The shooter, Joaquin Roman, died from a self-inflicted wound. The community mourns the loss, with the store expressing gratitude to first responders.

Wait, that's a bit too short. I need to include more details without exceeding 200 words. Let me try again, adding more specifics:

That's about 100 words. I can add more details, like the witness's account and the police response.
