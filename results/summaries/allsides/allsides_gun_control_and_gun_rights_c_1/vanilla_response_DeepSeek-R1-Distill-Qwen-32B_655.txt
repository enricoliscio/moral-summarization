Okay, I need to summarize this news article about a shooting in Springfield, Mo. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that police responded to a shooting at a gas station on March 15, 2020. Police Chief Paul Williams reported that a police officer, three citizens, and the gunman were killed. 

So, the main event is a shooting incident where a gunman fired randomly from his vehicle, causing multiple deaths. The gunman crashed into a convenience store, entered it, and started shooting, resulting in five deaths, including the officer and himself. 

I should note the details: the gunman's name is Joaquin S. Roman, 31 years old. The victims include a store employee, two men in the store, and the officer. Another officer was injured, as well as another person. 

The police chief described the gunman as a roving active shooter moving through the city. The gunman opened fire as police arrived, and officers had to take cover. The first two officers were shot, but others managed to rescue them and found three dead inside. The gunman died from a self-inflicted wound.

The officer killed was Christopher Walsh, a 32-year-old Army veteran, who died trying to rescue a victim. He left behind a wife and daughter. Another officer, Josiah Overton, was injured but not life-threateningly.

The article also mentions a witness, Casey Parrish, who saw the gunman firing at her as she was driving home. She wasn't hit but reported the incident to 911.

I need to condense all this information into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main events, the number of casualties, the gunman's identity, the officers involved, and the impact on the community.

I should structure it to first state the event, then the details of the gunman's actions, the casualties, the officers' bravery, and the aftermath.

Let me make sure to include the key points without going into too much detail. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

So, the summary should mention the shooting incident, the gunman's actions, the casualties, the officers' heroism, and the impact on the community.
