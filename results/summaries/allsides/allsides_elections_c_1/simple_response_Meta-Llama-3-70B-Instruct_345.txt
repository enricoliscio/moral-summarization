SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump has consistently proven his critics wrong. From the Russian collusion scandal to the COVID-19 crisis and the killing of George Floyd, Trump's approval ratings have remained strong. The author suggests that Trump's durability is due in part to the hyperbole of his critics, who consistently overstate the severity of the crises and predict his demise. The article cites numerous examples of pundits and experts who have been wrong in their predictions, including Peter Wehner, who wrote that Trump's presidency was "over" in mid-March, only to see his approval ratings reach a record high. The author concludes that Trump's best reelection guarantee is if Democrats continue to push a radical progressive agenda, and that the media should impose an editorial moratorium on "Trump is finished" pieces until after his reelection.
