SUMMARY:
Critics of President Donald Trump have repeatedly declared his political demise since the beginning of his presidential campaign. They have cited various events such as the Russian collusion story, impeachment, and the COVID-19 crisis as reasons for his downfall. However, Trump has consistently proven them wrong, maintaining positive approval ratings and even seeing his administration achieve economic successes. The recent protests following the death of George Floyd have once again sparked predictions of Trump's political demise, with critics accusing him of dictatorial tendencies and defending far-left militant groups like antifa. Despite these attacks, Trump remains durable, and his reelection chances are strong. The exaggerated claims of his critics only serve to benefit him, and their track record of inaccurate predictions should be noted. The narrative of Trump's inevitable downfall should be treated with skepticism until after the 2020 election.
