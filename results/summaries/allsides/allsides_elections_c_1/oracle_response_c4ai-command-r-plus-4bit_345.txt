SUMMARY: Once again, pundits and prognosticators are declaring that Donald Trump's presidency is over. This time, they point to the COVID-19 crisis, the economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown, and the crisis following the killing of George Floyd as events that will finally bring about Trump's political downfall. However, as the author points out, similar predictions have been made numerous times in the past, only for Trump to emerge unscathed. Despite the hyperbole of his critics, Trump's approval ratings remain resilient, and his reelection prospects look strong. The author argues that the durability of Trump's support is due in part to the exaggerated and apocalyptic rhetoric of his opponents, who have declared him "finished" so many times that their words have lost all credibility. While Trump's critics rush to defend far-left militants and paint him as a dictator, Trump's best reelection guarantee may be the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America pushed by his opponents. The author calls for an end to the "Trump is finished" narrative until after the 2024 election, when it may finally ring true.
END OF SUMMARY.
