SUMMARY: Despite predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump has proven his durability as President of the United States. Critics have repeatedly claimed that various events, such as the COVID-19 crisis, the economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown, and the George Floyd protests, would be the end of his presidency. However, Trump's approval ratings have remained relatively stable, and he continues to defy expectations. The hyperbole of his critics often works in Trump's favor, as they rush to defend far-left militant groups and attack his support for law enforcement. Trump's best chance for reelection may be if Democrats embrace the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America. Given the inaccurate predictions of Trump's critics in the past, it is suggested that there should be a moratorium on declaring "Trump is finished" until after the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
