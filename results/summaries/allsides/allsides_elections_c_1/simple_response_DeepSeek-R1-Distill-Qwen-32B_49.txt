Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about how Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political downfall. The author points out that despite numerous crises—like the COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturns, and social unrest—Trump's approval ratings and political standing remain resilient.

First, I should identify the main points. The article starts by mentioning how Trump has been declared politically dead multiple times, from his campaign to various crises. It then goes into specific examples: the COVID-19 response, where Trump's approval peaked; the economic recovery that was expected to hurt him but didn't; and the recent protests following George Floyd's death, which critics hoped would end his presidency. Despite these events, Trump's numbers haven't collapsed as predicted.

The author also critiques the hyperbole of Trump's critics, suggesting that their over-the-top claims might be backfiring. They argue that Trump's durability is a result of his critics' inability to accept his resilience, and they even suggest that the American experiment is at risk if the narrative continues.

I need to keep the moral framing, which seems to be that Trump's opponents are overestimating his vulnerabilities and underestimating his political strength. The author is critical of the media and political commentators for their persistent negativity towards Trump, which hasn't been borne out by events.

So, the summary should highlight Trump's resilience, the repeated failures of predictions against him, and the critique of his critics' hyperbole. It should also touch on the potential consequences for the political discourse if this narrative continues.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and clearly conveys the author's perspective that Trump's political strength is underestimated and that his critics' predictions have consistently been wrong.

The author critiques the hyperbole of Trump's critics, arguing their predictions of his downfall have consistently failed.
