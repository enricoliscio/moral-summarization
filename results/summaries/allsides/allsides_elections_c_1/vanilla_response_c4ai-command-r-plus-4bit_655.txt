SUMMARY: Despite numerous predictions of his political demise, Donald Trump has proven to be a durable and resilient president. Critics have repeatedly claimed that various scandals, crises, and unfavorable events would bring an end to Trump's presidency, but he has consistently defied these expectations.

The article highlights the hyperbole and exaggerated claims of Trump's critics, arguing that their overconfidence and biased interpretations of events have consistently proven to be wrong.

The article concludes by recommending an editorial moratorium on "Trump is finished" pieces until after the 2020 election.
