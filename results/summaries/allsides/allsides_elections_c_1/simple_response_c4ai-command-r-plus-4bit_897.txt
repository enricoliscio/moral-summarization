SUMMARY: Despite numerous predictions of his demise, Donald Trump has proven resilient and continues to defy expectations. Critics have repeatedly claimed that Trump's presidency is over, citing various issues such as the COVID-19 crisis, economic downturn, and recent protests. However, Trump's approval ratings remain strong, and he continues to make gains. The exaggerated claims of Trump's critics only serve to benefit him, as they are often proven wrong. Trump's durability is underscored by polling data, which shows him performing better than previous one-term presidents. The narrative of Trump's demise is premature and should be approached with caution, given the consistent failure of such predictions in the past. The article concludes by suggesting an editorial moratorium on declaring Trump's political death until after his reelection, which may finally validate such claims in 2025.
