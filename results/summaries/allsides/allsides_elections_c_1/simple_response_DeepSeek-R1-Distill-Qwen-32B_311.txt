Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. The article talks about how Donald Trump has repeatedly defied predictions of his political downfall. It mentions various crises, like COVID-19, economic downturns, and the George Floyd protests, where Trump's approval ratings didn't drop as expected. The author seems to criticize the media and pundits for constantly declaring Trump's political death, only to be proven wrong each time. 

I should focus on the key points: Trump's resilience, the incorrect predictions by critics, and the moral implication that the constant negative framing might be counterproductive. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include the main arguments without losing the original's critical tone towards the media.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Trump's consistent defying of predictions, then outline the specific crises mentioned, his approval ratings, and the critique of the media's hyperbole. Finally, I'll highlight the potential negative impact of the critics' narrative on the American experiment.

Let me make sure to include all these elements while keeping the language clear and within the word limit. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.
