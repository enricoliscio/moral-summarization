SUMMARY:

Despite numerous predictions of his demise, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. Critics have repeatedly written him off, from the "phony Russian collusion story" to his handling of the COVID-19 crisis, only to be proven wrong. The economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown was supposed to spell the end, but Trump's approval numbers on handling the economy have remained in positive territory. The stock market has rebounded strongly, and the unexpected gain of 2.5 million jobs pushed unemployment down to 13.3%, the largest monthly gain ever on record. Now, the crisis following the killing of George Floyd has become the latest hoped-for tectonic event that critics believe will finally do Trump in politically. However, the hyperbole of his critics, including accusations of brutality and racism, may ultimately work in Trump's favor. The author argues that Trump's durability is a testament to his ability to weather the storms, and that his critics' constant predictions of his downfall may ultimately prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
