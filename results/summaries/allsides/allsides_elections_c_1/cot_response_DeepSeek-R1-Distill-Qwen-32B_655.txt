Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about how many times Trump has been declared finished by pundits, but he keeps defying those predictions. Words like "scornful," "phony," "obituaries," "wrong," "hollow shell," "death sentence," "wrong yet again," "rebound," "unexpected," "killing," "protesters," "bunker," "darkened," "doctored," "agitated," "defunct," "defections," "apocalyptic," "dictator," "innocent civilians," "shot," "hyperbole," "failed," "extremist," "morally bankrupt," "experiment," "failing," "save," "dismal," "moratorium," "narrative," "until," "true," "2025."

Now, I need to write a summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the article, which is that Trump keeps surviving politically despite many predictions of his downfall, and his critics' hyperbole.

I'll start by stating that Trump has been declared finished many times, but he's still standing. Mention the COVID-19 response, economic rebound, and George Floyd protests as crises that were supposed to bring him down. Highlight his critics' hyperbole and how their predictions have been wrong. Conclude by noting that the American experiment is at risk and that a moratorium on declaring Trump finished is needed until after the election.

I should make sure to include words like "scornful," "phony," "obituaries," "wrong," "hollow shell," "death sentence," "wrong yet again," "rebound," "unexpected," "killing," "protesters," "bunker," "darkened," "doctored," "agitated," "defunct," "defections," "apocalyptic," "dictator," "innocent civilians," "shot," "hyperbole," "failed," "extremist," "morally bankrupt," "experiment," "failing," "save," "dismal," "moratorium," "narrative," "until," "true," "2025."

Wait, that's a lot of words. I need to make sure the summary flows well and isn't just a list. Maybe focus on the main points and use the most impactful morally charged words. Words like "scornful," "phony," "obituaries," "wrong," "hollow shell," "rebound," "unexpected," "killing," "protesters," "bunker," "darkened," "doctored," "agitated," "defunct," "defections," "apocalyptic," "dictator," "innocent civilians," "shot," "hyperbole," "failed," "extremist," "morally bankrupt," "experiment," "failing," "save," "dismal," "moratorium," "narrative," "until," "true," "2025." Hmm, maybe some can be grouped together.

I think I can structure it as: Trump has been declared finished many times (scornful, phony, obituaries) but keeps defying predictions. His COVID response, economy, and Floyd protests were supposed to end him (hollow shell, death sentence), but he rebounded (unexpected, rebound). Critics' hyperbole (agitated, defunct, apocalyptic, dictator) has been wrong, and their predictions failed. The American experiment is at risk (failing, save), and a moratorium on declaring Trump finished is needed until 2025.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of the identified words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me try drafting it now.

The article highlights how Donald Trump has repeatedly defied predictions of his political demise, despite being declared "finished" numerous times by critics. Words like "scornful," "phony," and "obituaries" underscore the dismissive and exaggerated nature of these claims. Trump's administration weathered crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where his response was initially condemned as a "hollow shell" but later saw a rebound in approval ratings. Similarly, the economic downturn and the protests following George Floyd's killing were expected to be his downfall, yet his approval numbers remained resilient. Critics' hyperbole, including claims of an "apocalyptic" scenario and comparisons to a "dictator," contrast with the reality of his political durability. The article suggests that the American experiment is at risk of failing due to such extremist narratives, advocating for a moratorium on declaring Trump's political death until after the 2025 election. END OF SUMMARY.
