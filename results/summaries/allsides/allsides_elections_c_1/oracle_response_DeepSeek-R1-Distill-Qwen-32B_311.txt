Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and should capture the main points of the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main arguments. The author is arguing that Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political demise. They mention several instances where pundits and experts were wrong about his presidency, such as his response to COVID-19, the economic recovery, and the George Floyd protests. The author also criticizes the hyperbole used by Trump's critics and suggests that their narratives might backfire, helping Trump's reelection.

I need to structure the summary to highlight Trump's durability, the incorrect predictions, and the moral framing elements. I should use words like "collusion," "response," "rebounded," "record," etc., as provided.

I'll start by stating that Trump has defied predictions, then mention the COVID-19 response and economic rebound, including the stock market and job numbers. Next, I'll address the George Floyd protests and the criticisms, using terms like "killing," "occupied," "doctored," "fire," "justice," and "brutality." Then, I'll note the claims of Trump relinquishing duties and defections, using "hyperbole" and "shot" as moral terms. Finally, I'll conclude with the author's view that the critics' hyperbole benefits Trump and the potential impact of their narratives on the election.

I should make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check to include all the key points without getting too detailed. Also, I'll ensure that the morally framed words are naturally integrated into the summary.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's political durability, despite repeated predictions of his downfall. Critics have long claimed Trump's presidency is over, citing issues like the COVID-19 response, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. However, Trump's approval ratings have rebounded, with the stock market reaching record highs and unemployment dropping significantly. The killing of George Floyd sparked protests, with critics framing Trump's actions as a political crisis. However, the author argues that Trump's critics have used hyperbole, such as claiming he has relinquished presidential duties or that his ship is sinking. Polling data shows Trump's approval numbers remain strong compared to recent presidents. The author suggests that the hyperbole of Trump's critics, including claims of justice and police brutality, may ultimately backfire, as their narratives could cave to extremist progressive demands, potentially harming the American experiment. END OF SUMMARY.
