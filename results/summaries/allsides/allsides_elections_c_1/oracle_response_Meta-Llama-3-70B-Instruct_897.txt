SUMMARY:

Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has proven to be resilient. Critics have been wrong time and again, from the Russian "collusion" story to the COVID-19 crisis, which was supposed to be a "death sentence" for his reelection hopes. Instead, Trump's approval ratings have remained strong, and the economy has "rebounded" with a record 2.5 million jobs gained in a single month. The recent crisis following the "killing" of George Floyd has sparked a new wave of anti-Trump narratives, with critics claiming he has "relinquished" his presidential duties. However, Trump's durability is evident, and his critics' "hyperbole" has only served to strengthen his position. The author argues that the president's critics should refrain from writing him off until after his reelection, as their track record of predictions has been dismal. END OF SUMMARY.
