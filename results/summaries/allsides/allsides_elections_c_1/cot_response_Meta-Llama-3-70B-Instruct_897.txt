SUMMARY:
Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has proven to be more resilient than expected. Critics have consistently been wrong about his demise, from the Russian collusion story to the COVID-19 crisis and the Ukrainian phone call impeachment. The Atlantic even declared "The Trump presidency is over" in mid-March, but his approval ratings have remained strong. The economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown was supposed to be a "death sentence" for his reelection hopes, but the stock market has rebounded strongly and unemployment has dropped to 13.3%. The crisis following George Floyd's killing has sparked yet another wave of "Trump is finished" narratives, but his critics' hyperbole and extremist views may ultimately work in his favor. Given their dismal track record, it's time to put a moratorium on "Trump is finished" pieces until after his reelection. END OF SUMMARY.
