SUMMARY: This article discusses the numerous predictions of Donald Trump's political demise, from the early days of his presidential campaign to the present, and how these predictions have consistently been proven wrong. Despite criticism over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic downturn, and the recent protests following the killing of George Floyd, Trump's approval ratings have remained relatively strong. The author argues that the hyperbole of Trump's critics and their inaccurate predictions work in Trump's favor, and that efforts to paint him as "finished" only serve to strengthen his position. The article also compares Trump's approval ratings to those of previous presidents and finds that Trump is faring better than both one-term and two-term presidents at similar points in their presidencies. The article concludes by suggesting that a more accurate prediction would be that Trump's reelection is guaranteed if Democrats embrace the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America.
