SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. From the Russian collusion scandal to the COVID-19 crisis, Trump's approval ratings have remained strong, and the economy has rebounded quickly. The recent crisis following George Floyd's killing has sparked a new wave of anti-Trump narratives, but the author contends that these criticisms are hyperbolic and misguided. The article cites examples of Trump's critics making exaggerated claims, such as Robert Reich declaring that Trump is "no longer president" and Paul Krugman predicting that Republicans would be happy with Trump as dictator. The author suggests that Trump's durability is due in part to the over-the-top reactions of his critics, and that Democrats' embrace of radical progressive change could ultimately guarantee Trump's reelection. The article concludes that the media should refrain from writing "Trump is finished" pieces until after his reelection.
