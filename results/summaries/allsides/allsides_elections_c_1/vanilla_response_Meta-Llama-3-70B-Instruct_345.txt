SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. From the Russian collusion scandal to the COVID-19 crisis and the killing of George Floyd, Trump's critics have been wrong in their assessments of his political demise. The article cites examples of pundits and experts who have written off Trump's chances, only to be proven wrong. Trump's approval ratings have remained strong, the economy has rebounded, and the stock market has reached record highs. The article suggests that Trump's durability is due in part to the hyperbole of his critics, who often overstate their case and alienate moderate voters. The author concludes that given the track record of Trump's critics, there should be a moratorium on "Trump is finished" pieces until after the election.
