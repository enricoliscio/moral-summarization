Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Donald Trump's political resilience. The article talks about how many times people have predicted Trump's downfall, but he keeps defying those predictions. Let me break it down.

First, the article mentions various events where Trump was thought to be finished: the primaries, the 2016 election predictions, the Russian collusion story, the impeachment, COVID-19 response, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each time, experts and pundits said he was doomed, but his approval ratings didn't drop as expected.

For example, during COVID-19, his approval went up, contrary to predictions. The economy also rebounded faster than expected, with job gains and a strong stock market. Then, during the protests after George Floyd's death, critics tried to paint Trump negatively, but his critics' hyperbole might actually help him.

The article also points out that Trump's approval numbers are comparable to past presidents, and his critics' constant negativity might backfire, making him more resilient. The author suggests that until Trump is actually defeated, it's premature to say he's finished.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Trump's resilience, the failed predictions, key events, and the impact of critics' hyperbole. Make sure to mention his approval ratings, economic recovery, and how his critics' actions might help him politically.
