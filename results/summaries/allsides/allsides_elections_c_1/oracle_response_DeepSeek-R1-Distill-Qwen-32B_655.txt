Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article talks about how Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political downfall. It mentions several instances where experts and pundits claimed he was finished, but he's still in the game. The author uses words like "collusion," "response," "rebounded," "record," etc., which carry moral connotations. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting Trump's resilience against various crises: COVID-19, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each section should mention how the critics' predictions were wrong. Also, I should include the hyperbole used by his critics and how it might backfire, especially with the mention of Joe Biden's civil rights record.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start with the overall theme of Trump defying obituaries, then go into each crisis, use the moral words appropriately, and conclude with the implications of the critics' hyperbole.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I should ensure each point is clear and that the moral framing is evident. Also, I need to end with the note about the editorial moratorium on "Trump is finished" narratives until after the election.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral words without making it too long.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's political durability, despite repeated predictions of his downfall. Critics have long claimed Trump's presidency is over, citing issues like the COVID-19 response, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. However, Trump's approval ratings have rebounded, with his economic handling remaining positive and the stock market reaching record highs. The killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests were seen as a potential turning point, but Trump's critics' hyperbole—such as claims of a "hollow shell" administration or threats of violence—has backfired. Trump's numbers remain comparable to past presidents, and his durability is aided by the hyperbole of his critics, who often overstate their case. The author suggests that Trump's reelection could be secured if Democrats adopt extremist narratives about systemic racism. The article concludes that the American experiment is at risk, and a moratorium on "Trump is finished" narratives is needed until after the election. END OF SUMMARY.
