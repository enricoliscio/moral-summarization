SUMMARY: The article discusses the recurring narrative that Donald Trump's presidency is over, and how this narrative has been proven wrong time and again. It highlights how critics have predicted Trump's downfall in response to various events, from the COVID-19 crisis to the George Floyd protests, yet Trump's approval ratings have remained relatively stable. The article also points out the hyperbole and exaggeration of Trump's critics, and how their predictions of his demise have consistently failed to materialize. It argues that Trump's durability is due in part to the overreactions and extreme positions of his opponents, and suggests that a more moderate approach would be more effective in defeating him. The article concludes by recommending an editorial moratorium on declaring Trump's presidency over until after he has been reelected.
