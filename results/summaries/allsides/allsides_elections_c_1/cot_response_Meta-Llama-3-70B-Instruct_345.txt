SUMMARY:
Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has proven to be remarkably resilient. Critics have consistently been wrong, from the "phony" Russian collusion story to the "hollow" response to the COVID-19 crisis. The economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown was supposed to be a "death sentence" for his reelection hopes, but Trump's approval numbers have remained strong. The killing of George Floyd has sparked a new wave of criticism, with some claiming Trump has "relinquished" his presidential duties and is now a "dictator" threatening innocent civilians. However, Trump's durability has been underestimated, and his critics' "hyperbole" may ultimately work in his favor. With his approval numbers still strong, it's possible that Trump will emerge victorious in the next election. END OF SUMMARY.
