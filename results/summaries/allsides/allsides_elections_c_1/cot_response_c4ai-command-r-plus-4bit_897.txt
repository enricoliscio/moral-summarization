SUMMARY:
Once again, the narrative that Donald Trump's presidency is over is being pushed, despite numerous past failures of this prediction. Critics point to the COVID-19 crisis, the economic shock of the lockdown, and the recent protests following the killing of George Floyd as reasons for Trump's impending downfall. However, Trump's approval ratings remain strong, and his response to these challenges has not significantly impacted his support. The exaggerated claims of Trump's critics and their defense of controversial groups like antifa work in Trump's favor. Biden's backers attempt to paint him as a unifier, despite his questionable civil rights record. Trump's reelection chances are bolstered by the overblown rhetoric of his opponents and their failure to acknowledge his durability. The American experiment feels like it is failing, and the exaggerated claims and biased narratives of Trump's critics only contribute to this sense of crisis.
END OF SUMMARY.
