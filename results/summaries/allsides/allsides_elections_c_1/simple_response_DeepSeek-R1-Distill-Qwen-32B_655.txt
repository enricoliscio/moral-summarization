Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. The article is about how Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political demise. The author is critical of the media and pundits who have repeatedly declared Trump's downfall, only to be proven wrong each time.

First, I should identify the main points. The article mentions several instances where Trump's approval ratings went up despite negative predictions, like during the COVID-19 crisis and the economic downturn. It also talks about the George Floyd protests and how Trump's critics tried to use that as a downfall moment, but he remained resilient.

The moral framing here is that the media and critics are hyperbolic and inaccurate in their assessments. The author suggests that these constant negative predictions are not just wrong but also ignore Trump's actual performance and the bigger picture, like the role of law enforcement and the importance of addressing systemic issues.

I need to make sure the summary captures this criticism of the media and the hyperbole used against Trump. Also, the conclusion about the American experiment and the call for a moratorium on declaring Trump's failure until after the election adds a moral angle about responsible journalism and analysis.

I should structure the summary to first state that Trump has defied predictions, then mention the specific events (COVID, economy, protests), the critics' hyperbole, and end with the author's call for responsible analysis. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each key point is included without going over the word limit. I'll start with the main idea, then list the events, mention the media's role, and conclude with the author's perspective on the American experiment and responsible reporting.
