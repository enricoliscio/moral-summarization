SUMMARY:
Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has proven resilient. Critics have repeatedly declared Trump finished, from the Russian collusion narrative to the COVID-19 crisis and economic shock. Yet Trump's approval ratings have remained resilient, and he continues to defy expectations. The recent events following George Floyd's killing have sparked new hopes among critics that Trump's presidency is finally ending. However, the author argues that Trump's durability stems from the hyperbole of his critics. When Trump denounces far-left militant groups or praises law enforcement, his critics rush to defend or defund them respectively. The author suggests that Trump's reelection is most guaranteed if Democrats embrace the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America requiring radical progressive change. The article concludes by mocking the critics' track record and suggesting an editorial moratorium on "Trump is finished" pieces until his reelection.
