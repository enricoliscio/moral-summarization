Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about how Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political downfall, despite various crises and challenges. The author is critical of the media and pundits who keep declaring Trump's political death, only to be proven wrong each time. 

First, I should identify the main points. The article mentions several instances where Trump was predicted to fail, like the COVID-19 response, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each time, Trump's approval ratings or political standing didn't collapse as predicted. The author points out that Trump's critics often use hyperbole, which might actually help Trump by creating a narrative that he's under siege, making him more resilient.

I also notice that the author compares Trump's approval numbers to those of previous presidents, showing that he's performing better than some one-term presidents. This is part of the moral framing, suggesting that the media's constant negative coverage is unfair and inaccurate.

I need to make sure the summary captures the main arguments: Trump's resilience, the inaccuracy of media predictions, and the potential negative impact of hyperbolic criticism on Trump's political standing. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the original tone, which is critical of the media and supportive of Trump's durability.

I'll structure the summary by first stating that Trump has defied predictions, then mention the specific crises, the inaccuracy of expert opinions, and the impact of hyperbole. Finally, I'll include the comparison to other presidents and the author's suggestion to stop the "Trump is finished" narrative.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. I'll make sure each point is clear and that the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political downfall, despite numerous crises. From the COVID-19 pandemic to the economic downturn and the George Floyd protests, Trump's approval ratings and political standing have not collapsed as critics predicted. Experts and media outlets, such as The Atlantic, Yahoo Finance, and The New York Times, have repeatedly declared Trump's presidency over, only to be proven wrong. Trump's approval numbers on handling the economy and crisis have remained resilient, with the stock market rebounding and unemployment improving. The article criticizes the hyperbole of Trump's critics, suggesting that their extreme narratives may反而 bolster Trump's durability. Comparing Trump's approval ratings to those of past presidents, the author notes that he fares better than one-term presidents like George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. The article concludes that the constant narrative of Trump's political death is premature and suggests a moratorium on such claims until after the election. END OF SUMMARY.
