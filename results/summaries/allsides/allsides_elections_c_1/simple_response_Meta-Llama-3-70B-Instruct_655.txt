SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. Critics have been wrong about his demise, from the Russian collusion story to the COVID-19 crisis and the economic downturn. Trump's approval ratings have remained strong, and the stock market has rebounded. The latest crisis, following the killing of George Floyd, has sparked a new wave of anti-Trump narratives, but the article suggests that these will ultimately prove unfounded. The hyperbole of Trump's critics, including claims that he is no longer president or that he will become a dictator, only serve to bolster his support. The article concludes that Trump's durability is a testament to his ability to weather criticism and that his critics should refrain from writing him off until after the election.
