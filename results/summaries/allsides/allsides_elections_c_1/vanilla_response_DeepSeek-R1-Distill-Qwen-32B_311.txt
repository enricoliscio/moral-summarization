Okay, I need to summarize this article about Donald Trump and how his critics have been predicting his downfall, but he's still holding strong. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article starts by saying that Trump has been declared finished multiple times, from his campaign to various political crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each time, his approval ratings didn't drop as expected. For example, during the pandemic, his ratings actually went up, and the economy rebounded faster than experts predicted.

Then, during the George Floyd protests, critics thought this would be the end for Trump, but he's still managing to stay relevant. The article also mentions how some media outlets have been circulating false information, like the doctored picture of the White House. 

Another point is that Trump's approval numbers are similar to past presidents like Obama and George W. Bush, and higher than one-term presidents like Carter and George H.W. Bush. The critics' hyperbole might be working in Trump's favor because people are reacting against the extreme narratives.

Finally, the article suggests that the American experiment is at risk, and the constant negative predictions about Trump might not be helpful. It advises waiting until after the election to see if he's truly finished.

So, putting it all together, the summary should highlight Trump's resilience despite constant predictions of his downfall, the specific crises he's weathered, the impact of critics' hyperbole, and the comparison to other presidents. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures all these elements clearly.
