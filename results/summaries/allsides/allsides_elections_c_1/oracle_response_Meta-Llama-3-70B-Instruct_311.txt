SUMMARY:

Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump has consistently proven his critics wrong. From the Russian "collusion" story to the Ukrainian phone call impeachment, Trump has defied expectations. Recently, pundits claimed his response to the COVID-19 crisis would be his demise, but his approval ratings reached a record high. The economic shock of the lockdown was supposed to spell disaster, but the stock market has rebounded strongly, and unemployment has pushed down to 13.3%. Now, critics hope the crisis following George Floyd's killing will finally do Trump in, but their narratives are filled with hyperbole. They claim Trump has relinquished his presidential duties and is threatening the nation, but polls show his numbers are comparable to his predecessors. The hyperbole of his critics works in Trump's favor, as they rush to defend antifa and defund law enforcement. If Democrats cave to the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America, it will only guarantee Trump's reelection. END OF SUMMARY.
