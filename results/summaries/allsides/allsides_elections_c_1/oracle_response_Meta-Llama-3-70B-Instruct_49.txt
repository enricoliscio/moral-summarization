SUMMARY:

Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. Critics have been wrong about his demise, from the Russian "collusion" story to the COVID-19 crisis response. Trump's approval ratings have remained strong, even reaching a record high during the pandemic. The economy has "rebounded" strongly, with the stock market back in record territory and a historic gain of 2.5 million jobs. The killing of George Floyd has sparked a new wave of criticism, but Trump's durability remains unshaken. His critics have resorted to "doctored" photos and exaggerated claims, accusing him of "relinquishing" his presidential duties. The hyperbole of his critics, including predictions of him becoming a dictator, has only served to strengthen his position. As the election approaches, Trump's chances of reelection look increasingly strong, despite his critics' continued attempts to "push" a narrative of his demise. END OF SUMMARY.
