Okay, so I'm trying to summarize this news article. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article is about how Donald Trump has been declared finished multiple times by critics, but he's still in the game. The author seems to be defending Trump by pointing out how wrong the critics have been each time. 

First, I need to identify the key points. The article mentions several instances where Trump was predicted to fail: the COVID-19 response, the economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each time, the critics were wrong, and Trump's approval ratings didn't drop as expected. The author also criticizes the hyperbole from Trump's critics, suggesting that their extreme claims backfire and help Trump. 

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's resilience and the repeated failures of the critics' predictions. It's important to mention the specific events and the contrasting views between the critics and Trump's actual performance. Also, the author's point about the hyperbole and its effect on Trump's standing should be included.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear—that Trump's critics are overstepping with their claims, which might actually help Trump. I'll start by stating that Trump has repeatedly defied predictions of his downfall, then list the main events where this happened, and conclude with the impact of the critics' hyperbole. 

Let me make sure I'm not adding any personal opinions, just summarizing the article's points. Also, I should use the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed. Okay, I think I have a good structure in mind. Time to put it all together succinctly.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how Donald Trump has repeatedly defied predictions of his political downfall, despite numerous attempts by critics to declare his presidency over. From the COVID-19 crisis to the economic downturn and the George Floyd protests, Trump's approval ratings have not collapsed as predicted. Critics' hyperbole, such as claims of a "hollow shell" administration or a "death sentence" for reelection, have consistently been proven wrong. Trump's durability is underscored by his sustained positive approval ratings, economic recovery, and job market rebound. The article also critiques the extreme rhetoric of Trump's opponents, suggesting that their over-the-top claims may反而 strengthen Trump's position. The author argues that the American experiment remains viable, and the repeated failure of anti-Trump narratives should prompt a moratorium on declaring Trump's political death until after the election. END OF SUMMARY.
