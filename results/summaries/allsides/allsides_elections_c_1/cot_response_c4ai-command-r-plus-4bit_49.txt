SUMMARY:
The article discusses the repeated predictions of Donald Trump's political demise and how these predictions have consistently been proven wrong. The author argues that the hyperbolic and biased nature of Trump's critics works in his favor, as they often rush to defend or justify actions and positions that are unpopular with the general public. The article gives examples of how Trump has been criticized for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown, and the crisis following the killing of George Floyd. In each case, the predictions of Trump's downfall proved to be exaggerated or simply incorrect. The author also notes that Trump's durability is often underestimated, and his critics go as far as to pretend he doesn't exist or is no longer president. The article concludes by suggesting that the critics' track record is so dismal that there should be a moratorium on "Trump is finished" narratives until after his reelection. The moral framing of the article emphasizes the scornful, faulty, and hyperbolic nature of Trump's critics, while also highlighting the durability and resilience of Trump's presidency in the face of these attacks.
