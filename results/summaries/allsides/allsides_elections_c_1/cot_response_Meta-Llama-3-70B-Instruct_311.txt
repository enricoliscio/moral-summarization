SUMMARY:
Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied critics' expectations. From the "phony" Russian collusion story to the COVID-19 crisis, Trump's approval ratings have remained strong. The economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown was supposed to be a "death sentence" for his reelection hopes, but the stock market has rebounded strongly, and unemployment has decreased to 13.3%. Critics' "hyperbole" has worked in Trump's favor, as they rush to defend militant antifa and defund law enforcement. The "dismal" track record of Trump's critics suggests that their predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. In fact, Trump's durability has been consistently underestimated, and his critics' "extremist" narrative may ultimately guarantee his reelection. END OF SUMMARY.
