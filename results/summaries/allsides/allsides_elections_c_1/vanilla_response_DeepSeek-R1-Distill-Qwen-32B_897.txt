Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The article talks about how Donald Trump has been declared finished many times by pundits and the media, but he keeps defying those predictions. Let me break it down.

First, the article mentions several instances where Trump was thought to be on his way out. Like during the COVID-19 crisis, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each time, the media predicted his downfall, but his approval ratings and the actual events didn't support that.

For example, after The Atlantic's article saying his presidency was over due to COVID, his approval ratings actually went up. Similarly, the economic recovery was faster than expected, with job gains and a strong stock market. The protests following George Floyd's death were another supposed crisis, but again, the media's predictions didn't hold up.

The article also points out that Trump's critics often use hyperbole, which might be backfiring. They argue that their extreme claims might actually help Trump by making him look like a victim of a biased media. The piece suggests that the narrative of Trump's imminent defeat is overused and not based on reality, as his approval ratings are still comparable to past presidents.

So, the main points are: Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political demise, media and critics have repeatedly been wrong, and their hyperbole might be counterproductive. The summary should capture these points succinctly within 200 words.
