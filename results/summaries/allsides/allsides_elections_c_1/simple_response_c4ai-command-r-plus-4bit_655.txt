SUMMARY: How many times have we heard that Trump is finished? Despite the constant predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump has proven his durability time and again. From the Russian collusion narrative to the impeachment attempt, Trump has always come out on top. Now, as the nation faces the COVID-19 crisis, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests, his critics are once again declaring his presidency over. Yet Trump's approval ratings remain strong, and his response to these challenges has even boosted his support in some areas. The hyperbole of his critics only works in Trump's favor, and the narrative of a fundamentally racist America pushed by extremists could be Trump's best reelection guarantee. Given the track record of those who predict his demise, it is safe to assume that Trump is far from finished.

END OF SUMMARY.
