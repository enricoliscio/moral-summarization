Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about how Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions that his presidency is over. It mentions various events like the COVID-19 crisis, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests, where experts and critics predicted his downfall, but his approval ratings remained stable or even improved.

I should note the key points: Trump's resilience despite negative predictions, the COVID response leading to higher approval, economic recovery despite expert forecasts, and the George Floyd protests not harming his standing as expected.

Also, the article contrasts Trump's approval numbers with past presidents, showing he's performing similarly or better. It ends by suggesting that Trump's critics' hyperbole might actually help his reelection chances.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures these main ideas without getting too detailed.
