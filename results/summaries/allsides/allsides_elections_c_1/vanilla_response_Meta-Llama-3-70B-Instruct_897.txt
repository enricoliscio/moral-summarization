SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. From the Russian collusion story to the COVID-19 crisis, Trump's critics have been wrong, and his approval ratings have remained strong. The latest crisis following the killing of George Floyd has sparked new predictions of his political demise, but the article suggests that these claims are exaggerated. Trump's durability is attributed to the hyperbole of his critics, who often defend extremist groups and rush to defund law enforcement. The article cites polling data showing Trump's approval ratings are comparable to those of his predecessors, and that his critics' track record of predicting his downfall is dismal. The author concludes that Trump's reelection is likely, and that his critics should refrain from writing "Trump is finished" pieces until after the election.
