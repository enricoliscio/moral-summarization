SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. Critics have written him off multiple times, from the Russian collusion story to the COVID-19 crisis, but Trump's approval ratings have remained strong. The economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown was supposed to spell the end of his reelection hopes, but the stock market has rebounded strongly and unemployment has dropped to 13.3%. The article suggests that Trump's durability is due in part to the hyperbole of his critics, who have repeatedly underestimated him. Despite recent protests and criticisms, Trump's approval numbers remain in positive territory, and his critics' predictions of his demise have been consistently wrong. The article concludes that Trump's best reelection guarantee may be if Democrats continue to push a radical progressive narrative.
