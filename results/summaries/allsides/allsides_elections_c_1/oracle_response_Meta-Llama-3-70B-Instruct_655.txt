SUMMARY:

Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. Critics have repeatedly written his political obituary, only to be proven wrong. From the Russian collusion story to the COVID-19 crisis, Trump's approval ratings have remained resilient. The economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown was supposed to spell the end, but the stock market has rebounded strongly, and the unexpected gain of 2.5 million jobs pushed unemployment down to 13.3%. The crisis following the killing of George Floyd has become the latest hoped-for tectonic event that critics believe will finally do Trump in politically. However, Trump's durability has been underestimated, and his critics' hyperbole has worked in his favor. If Trump denounces far-left militant antifa as terrorists, some rush to defend them, and if Trump praises law enforcement, progressives rush to defund them. The American experiment is not failing, and Trump's reelection is still a possibility.

END OF SUMMARY.
