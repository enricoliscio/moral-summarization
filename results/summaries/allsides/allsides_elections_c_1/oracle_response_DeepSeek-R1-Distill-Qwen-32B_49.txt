Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is talking about how Donald Trump has consistently defied predictions of his political downfall. He's been underestimated many times, from the primaries to the COVID-19 response, economic recovery, and the George Floyd protests.

I notice the author uses a lot of morally charged words like "collusion," "response," "rebounded," and "record." I need to make sure these are included in the summary. The key events are the COVID-19 crisis, the economic rebound, and the protests. Each time, Trump's approval ratings didn't drop as predicted.

The author also criticizes the media and critics for hyperbole and inaccurate predictions. They mention how Trump's critics often overstate their case, which ends up helping Trump. I should highlight that dynamic.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start by stating Trump's resilience, mention the specific events and how he defied expectations, and then touch on the role of hyperbole from his critics. Finally, I'll conclude with the author's point about the American experiment and the moratorium on declaring Trump finished.

Let me structure this step by step. First, introduce Trump's consistent defying of predictions. Then, outline each major event where he was thought to fail but didn't. Next, discuss the critics' hyperbole and how it benefits Trump. Finally, wrap up with the author's suggestion about saving the American experiment and waiting to declare Trump's defeat.

I should ensure that all the morally framed words are included where appropriate. Words like "response" when talking about COVID, "rebounded" for the economy, "killing" for George Floyd, and "hyperbole" for the critics' overstatements. I'll make sure these are seamlessly integrated into the summary without making it sound forced.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, keeping it within the word limit and making sure it captures the essence of the article while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's political resilience, despite repeated predictions of his downfall. From the COVID-19 crisis to the economic downturn and the protests following George Floyd's killing, Trump has defied expectations. His approval ratings for handling the crisis peaked, and the economy rebounded faster than experts predicted, with the stock market reaching record highs and unemployment dropping significantly. Critics have hyped crises as opportunities to politically destroy Trump, but his durability persists. The author notes that Trump's critics often overstate their case, with hyperbole working in his favor. For example, when Trump condemns far-left groups like antifa, progressives rush to defend them, while his praise for law enforcement sparks calls to defund it. The article suggests that Trump's reelection could be secured if Democrats adopt an extremist narrative of a racist America. The author argues that the American experiment can still succeed, but only if critics stop prematurely declaring Trump "finished." Until then, the narrative should wait for the 2024 election results. END OF SUMMARY.
