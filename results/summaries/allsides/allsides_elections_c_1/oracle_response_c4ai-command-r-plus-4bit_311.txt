SUMMARY: Once again, critics are claiming that Donald Trump's presidency is over, citing the COVID-19 pandemic response, the economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown, and the recent protests following the killing of George Floyd. However, Trump has proven his durability time and time again, with his approval ratings remaining relatively stable despite negative predictions. The hyperbole of his critics often works in Trump's favor, and his reelection chances may be strengthened if Democrats embrace the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America. Trump's response to the COVID-19 crisis reached a record high, and his approval ratings on handling the economy have remained positive despite the temporary downturn. The stock market has rebounded, and unemployment has decreased. Trump's critics have been wrong in the past and continue to be wrong, as his numbers compare favorably with previous two-term presidents. The media's exaggerated claims and biased narratives only serve to bolster Trump's position. The American experiment feels like it is failing, but there is still a chance to save it. We should be cautious of declaring Trump's political demise until after his reelection.
END OF SUMMARY.
