SUMMARY: How many times has the media falsely declared Donald Trump's political career over? From the "phony" Russian collusion narrative to the Ukraine impeachment attempt, the media has consistently underestimated Trump's durability. Despite predictions that the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn would be his downfall, Trump's approval ratings have remained positive. The recent protests and criticism over his response have again sparked claims that Trump's presidency is finished. However, his critics' hyperbole works in his favor, and polls show Trump is in a comparable or better position than his two-term predecessors at this stage. The narrative of Trump's demise is premature and should be avoided until his reelection in 2025. Trump's critics' track record of incorrect predictions should prompt an editorial moratorium on such claims.
END OF SUMMARY.
