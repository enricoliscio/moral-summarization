SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump has consistently proven his critics wrong. From the Russian collusion story to the COVID-19 crisis, and now the George Floyd protests, Trump's approval ratings have remained strong. The article cites various opinion pieces and polls that have incorrectly predicted Trump's demise, and notes that his critics' hyperbole has actually worked in his favor. The author suggests that Trump's durability is due in part to the extreme narratives of his critics, who have repeatedly declared him "finished" only to be proven wrong. The article concludes that given the track record of Trump's critics, there should be a moratorium on "Trump is finished" pieces until after his reelection.
