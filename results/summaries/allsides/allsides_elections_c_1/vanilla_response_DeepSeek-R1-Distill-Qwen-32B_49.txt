Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about how Donald Trump has been declared "finished" multiple times by critics and pundits, but he keeps defying those predictions. It mentions various events like the COVID-19 crisis, economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each time, Trump's approval ratings didn't drop as expected. The article also points out that experts were wrong about the economy, with a strong stock market rebound and job gains. The author criticizes the hyperbole from Trump's critics, suggesting their over-the-top claims backfire. They also mention that Trump's approval numbers are comparable to past presidents and argue that the "Trump is finished" narrative is premature. The conclusion is that the American experiment is still viable and that Trump's critics should wait until after the election to declare him finished.

So, the summary should include the main points: Trump's consistent defying of being "finished," key events where his ratings didn't drop, economic rebounds, criticism of hyperbole, comparison to past presidents, and the argument against premature declarations. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.
