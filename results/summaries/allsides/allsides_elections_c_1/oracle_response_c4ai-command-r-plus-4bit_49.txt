SUMMARY: How many times have we heard that Donald Trump is finished? Despite scornful predictions, faulty polls, and the phony Russian collusion story, Trump has consistently defied expectations. Critics continue to claim that Trump is politically doomed, citing the COVID-19 crisis, the economic shock of the lockdown, and now the killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests. However, Trump's approval ratings remain strong, and his durability frustrates his critics. The hyperbole of Trump's critics often backfires, and their track record of predicting his demise is dismal. Trump's best reelection guarantee may be if Democrats embrace the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America requiring radical progressive change. Given the failure of past predictions, perhaps there should be a moratorium on "Trump is finished" narratives until after the 2020 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
