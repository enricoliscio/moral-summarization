SUMMARY: The media and pundits have been consistently wrong about President Donald Trump's political demise since the beginning of his presidential campaign. Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Trump has proven to be resilient and continues to defy expectations. The recent events, including the COVID-19 crisis, the economic shock, and the George Floyd protests, have been touted as potential tipping points, but Trump's approval ratings remain relatively stable. His critics' hyperbole and exaggerated narratives only serve to strengthen Trump's position. The article challenges the notion that Trump is finished, highlighting the disconnect between media narratives and reality. It suggests that Trump's durability is often underestimated, and his critics' hyperbolic predictions only play into his hands. The author calls for a more nuanced and realistic assessment of Trump's presidency, arguing that the "Trump is finished" narrative should be retired until his reelection in 2025.

END OF SUMMARY.
