Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the task. The user provided an article that's quite lengthy, and they want a summary that keeps the moral words intact. 

Looking at the article, it's about how Donald Trump has defied expectations and predictions of his downfall. The author is critical of the media and pundits who keep claiming Trump is finished, only to be proven wrong each time. The article uses strong moral language to highlight the over-the-top reactions from Trump's critics.

For step one, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. These are words that express judgment or evaluation. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "scornful," "phony," "wrong," "hollow," "death sentence," "wrong," "positive," "rebound," "strongly," "record," "unexpected," "gained," "pushed," "largest," "judges," "hunkered," "darkened," "doctored," "agitated," "defund," "defunct," "apocalyptic," "dictator," "innocent," "hyperbole," "failed," "dismal," "moratorium," "narrative," "fundamentally," "racist," "radical," "progressive," "experiment," "save."

Next, I have to write a concise summary. I need to make sure to include as many of these moral words as possible without making it too long. The summary should capture the main points: Trump's resilience, the repeated failures of predictions against him, the hyperbole from critics, and the overall narrative that he's still a viable candidate despite attempts to discredit him.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's defiance of negative predictions, the incorrect expert opinions, the strong performance in key areas like the economy, and the overblown reactions from his critics. I'll also mention the comparison to other presidents and the conclusion about the American experiment.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the key moral terms. Let me make sure each point flows logically and the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

### SUMMARY:  
The article highlights Donald Trump's resilience despite repeated predictions of his political downfall. Critics, including pundits and experts, have consistently underestimated Trump, as his approval ratings and political standing have defied expectations. During the COVID-19 crisis, his ratings reached a record high, and the economy rebounded faster than anticipated, with the stock market and job market showing strong recovery. The killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests were seen as a potential turning point, but Trump's critics' hyperbolic claims—such as calling him a "dictator"—have not materialized. Polls suggest Trump's support remains stable, comparable to past presidents, and his critics' dismal track record of predictions suggests their narrative of his political demise is premature. The article argues that Trump's durability is a testament to the American experiment, and his reelection could hinge on the Democrats' embrace of extremist narratives. END OF SUMMARY.
