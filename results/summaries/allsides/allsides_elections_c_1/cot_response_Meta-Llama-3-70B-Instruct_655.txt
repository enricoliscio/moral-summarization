SUMMARY:
Despite numerous predictions of his demise, Donald Trump's presidency has proven to be more durable than expected. Critics have been consistently wrong in their assessments, from the "phony" Russian collusion story to the "hollow" response to the COVID-19 crisis. The economic downturn was supposed to be a "death sentence" for his reelection hopes, but Trump's approval numbers have remained in positive territory. The crisis following George Floyd's killing has sparked a new wave of "agitated" responses, with critics predicting his downfall. However, Trump's numbers compare favorably with his predecessors, and his critics' "hyperbole" may ultimately work in his favor. If Democrats cave to the "extremist" narrative of a fundamentally racist America, it may guarantee Trump's reelection. END OF SUMMARY.
