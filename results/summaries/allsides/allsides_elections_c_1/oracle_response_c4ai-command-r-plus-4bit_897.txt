SUMMARY: Once again, the mainstream media has declared that Donald Trump's presidency is over. From the phony Russian collusion story to the impeachment over a phone call, Trump has repeatedly defied predictions of his political demise. Despite the COVID-19 crisis and the economic lockdown, Trump's approval ratings have remained strong, with his response to the pandemic even reaching a record high. Now, critics are hoping that the George Floyd protests will be the event that finally sinks Trump. However, the hyperbole of Trump's critics consistently fails to materialize. Trump's durability is evident in his polling numbers, which compare favorably to his two-term predecessors and are significantly higher than those of our most recent one-term presidents. The exaggerated claims of Trump's critics only serve to strengthen his position. The best guarantee for Trump's reelection may be if Democrats embrace the extremist narrative of a fundamentally racist America. It seems the American experiment is failing, but there is still a chance to save it.
END OF SUMMARY.
