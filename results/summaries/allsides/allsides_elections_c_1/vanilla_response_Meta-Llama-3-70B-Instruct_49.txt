SUMMARY:

The article argues that despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump's presidency has consistently defied expectations. Critics have been wrong about his chances in the primaries, the Russian collusion story, the Ukrainian phone call impeachment, and his handling of the COVID-19 crisis. Recently, they predicted that the economic shock of the coronavirus lockdown and the crisis following the killing of George Floyd would be the final nails in his political coffin. However, Trump's approval ratings have remained strong, the stock market has rebounded, and unemployment has decreased. The article suggests that the hyperbole of Trump's critics, who have repeatedly declared him "finished," has actually worked in his favor. It concludes that given the dismal track record of Trump's critics, there should be a moratorium on "Trump is finished" pieces until after his reelection.
