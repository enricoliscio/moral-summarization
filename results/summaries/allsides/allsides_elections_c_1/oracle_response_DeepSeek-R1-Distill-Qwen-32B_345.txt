Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The author is talking about how Donald Trump has been declared "finished" multiple times by critics, but each time, he's managed to stay relevant or even gain approval. They mention several instances like the COVID-19 response, the economic downturn, and the George Floyd protests. Each time, Trump's approval didn't drop as predicted, and in some cases, it went up. 

The author uses a lot of morally charged words like "collusion," "response," "killing," "fire," "justice," "brutality," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's durability despite critics' predictions. Start by mentioning how often Trump has been declared finished, then go through each event (COVID, economy, protests) and how Trump's approval held up. Also, note the hyperbole from critics and the impact on public perception. 

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but include the key moral terms. Let me outline the points: 

1. Introduction about Trump being declared finished multiple times.
2. COVID response: critics thought it would bring him down, but his approval went up.
3. Economic downturn: experts predicted a long recovery, but it rebounded quickly.
4. George Floyd protests: critics hoped this would end his presidency, but his numbers stayed positive.
5. Critics' hyperbole and how it backfires, helping Trump.
6. Conclusion about Trump's durability and the impact of critics' narratives.

Now, I'll draft the summary using the moral words and keeping each point brief.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how Donald Trump has repeatedly defied predictions of his political demise. Despite claims of "collusion," a poor "response" to COVID-19, an economic "rebound," and the "killing" of George Floyd sparking protests, Trump's approval ratings remained resilient. Critics' hyperbole, such as accusing him of "brutality" and "defending" far-left groups, often backfired. Trump's durability is evident as his numbers stayed positive, even during the "fire" of protests and "justice" debates. The article suggests that Trump's reelection could hinge on Democrats embracing an "extremist" narrative of a "racist" America. END OF SUMMARY.
