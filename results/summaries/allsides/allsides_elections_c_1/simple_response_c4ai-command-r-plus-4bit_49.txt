SUMMARY: Once again, critics are declaring Donald Trump's presidency over in response to recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic crisis, and the protests following the killing of George Floyd. However, Trump has repeatedly defied these predictions and remains resilient in the face of adversity. Despite negative media narratives and pundit predictions, Trump's approval ratings remain relatively stable, and he continues to make gains in certain areas. The exaggerated claims and hyperbolic reactions of Trump's critics only serve to strengthen his position. The track record of these critics in predicting Trump's downfall has been consistently wrong, and their latest declarations should be taken with a grain of salt. The moral framing of this article emphasizes the perceived hypocrisy and overreaction of Trump's critics, suggesting that their extreme responses play into Trump's hands and contribute to his durability.
