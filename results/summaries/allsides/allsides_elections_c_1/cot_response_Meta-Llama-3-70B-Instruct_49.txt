SUMMARY:
Despite numerous predictions of his downfall, Donald Trump has consistently proven his critics wrong. From the "phony" Russian collusion story to the Ukrainian phone call impeachment and acquittal, Trump has had more obituaries written about him than deceased presidents. The Atlantic and Yahoo Finance predicted his demise due to the COVID-19 crisis and economic downturn, but Trump's approval ratings have remained strong. Now, critics claim the crisis following George Floyd's killing will be the final nail in his political coffin. However, Trump's durability is evident, and his critics' "hyperbole" and "apocalyptic" visions only serve to boost his chances. With his approval numbers comparable to his predecessors, Trump's reelection seems likely, especially if Democrats cave to the "extremist" narrative of a fundamentally racist America. END OF SUMMARY.
