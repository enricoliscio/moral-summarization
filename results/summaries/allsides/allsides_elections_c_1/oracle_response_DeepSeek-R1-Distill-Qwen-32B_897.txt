Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words the author used. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible. 

First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about how Donald Trump has defied multiple predictions of his political downfall, from his campaign to the COVID-19 response, economic recovery, and the George Floyd protests. The author criticizes the media and critics for consistently claiming Trump is finished, only to be proven wrong each time. The key is to highlight Trump's resilience and the hyperbole from his critics.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article. The list includes words like collusion, response, record, pushed, killing, occupied, doctored, fire, justice, brutality, relinquished, defections, threatening, shot, killed, hyperbole, heal, cave, racist. I should incorporate as many of these as possible without making the summary sound forced.

I'll start by outlining the main events: the COVID-19 response, the economic rebound, the George Floyd protests, and the critics' reactions. Each of these sections should include the relevant moral words. For example, the COVID response can use "response" and "record." The economic part can mention "rebounded" and "record." The protests can include "killing," "occupied," "doctored," "fire," "justice," "brutality." 

I should also address the critics' hyperbole, using words like "hyperbole," "relinquished," "defections," "threatening," "shot," "killed," "heal," "cave," and "racist." It's important to show how the critics' exaggerated claims haven't panned out, as the article emphasizes.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure each key point is covered. I'll structure it by first stating Trump's resilience, then each event with the relevant moral words, and finally the critics' hyperbole and the call for a moratorium on declaring Trump finished.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and make sure the summary flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's political durability despite repeated claims that he is "finished." From the COVID-19 crisis to the economic rebound and the protests following the killing of George Floyd, Trump has defied predictions of his political demise. Critics' claims of a "hollow shell" administration or a "death sentence" for reelection have been proven wrong, as Trump's approval ratings remain resilient. The response to the COVID-19 crisis saw a record high in his approval, and the economy rebounded strongly, with unemployment dropping to 13.3% after a record gain of 2.5 million jobs. The protests, which occupied public spaces and involved acts of fire and violence, were framed as a potential political downfall for Trump. However, his critics' hyperbole, including claims of "relinquished" presidential duties and "defections" from his base, have not panned out. Polls show Trump's numbers are comparable to his predecessors, and his critics' apocalyptic visions, such as claims of a "dictator" or "racist" America, have been met with skepticism. The article concludes that Trump's durability is a testament to the hyperbole of his critics, and the American experiment remains intact. END OF SUMMARY.
