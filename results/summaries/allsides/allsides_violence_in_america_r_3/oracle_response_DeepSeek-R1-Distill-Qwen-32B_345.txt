Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump addressed the Las Vegas attack, calling it an act of pure evil. He mentioned the number of casualties, his plans to visit, and the flags at half-staff. He focused on unity, faith, and offered prayers. He also mentioned the suspect, Stephen Paddock, and the ongoing investigations.

I need to include the morally charged words like attack, evil, shooting, dead, hospitalized, died, praying, etc. I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's response, the impact of the attack, and the moral themes he emphasized. I'll make sure to mention the unity, the role of faith, and the hope for safety and peace. I also need to include the details about the suspect and the law enforcement's condition.

I should start by stating Trump's address, then the casualties, his actions, the moral framing words, and the broader implications. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it, making sure to incorporate as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump condemned the Las Vegas attack as an "act of pure evil," expressing condolences for the 58 dead and 515 hospitalized victims. He vowed to visit Las Vegas, ordered flags to fly at half-staff, and offered prayers for the nation, emphasizing unity, faith, and shared values. Trump described the event as a "very dark period," seeking solace in scripture and urging hope amid chaos and violence. He acknowledged the difficulty of finding meaning in such tragedy, stating, "Our unity cannot be shattered by evil." The suspect, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was killed, and authorities were confident in locating his roommate, Marilou Danley. Law enforcement noted the attack was well-planned, involving automatic weapons, though the motive remained unclear. Trump and Melania Trump extended their condolences, with the latter tweeting, "My heart and prayers go out to victims, families & loved ones! #PrayForLasVegas." The attack left two off-duty police officers dead and one on-duty officer in critical condition. END OF SUMMARY.
