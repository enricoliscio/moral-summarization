SUMMARY:

President Trump addressed the nation, calling the Las Vegas attack an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. He announced a visit to Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims. The president ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor those who died. In a unifying speech, Trump offered prayers and comfort to the families, citing scripture that "the Lord is close to the broken hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit." He emphasized the importance of unity, faith, and shared values, stating "our unity cannot be shattered by evil" and "our bonds cannot be broken by violence." Trump and the First Lady prayed for the nation, seeking a day when "evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and fear." The suspect, Stephen Paddock, was killed, and authorities are investigating his motive.
