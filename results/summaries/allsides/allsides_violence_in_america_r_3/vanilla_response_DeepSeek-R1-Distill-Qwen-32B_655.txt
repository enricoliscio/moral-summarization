Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. Let me read through the article carefully to extract the key points.

First, the article mentions that President Trump called the attack an "act of pure evil" in a somber address. He announced he'll visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement and victims' families. He also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. 

In his speech, Trump focused on unity and faith, offering prayers to the victims' families. He mentioned seeking comfort in religious teachings and emphasized that unity and bonds can't be broken by evil. He acknowledged the difficulty in finding meaning in such chaos but expressed hope for the future.

The article also provides details about the attack: 58 dead, 515 hospitalized. The suspect, Stephen Paddock, was killed, and his roommate, Marilou Danley, was identified as a person of interest. Authorities are still determining the motive, but it's noted that the attack was well-planned and involved automatic weapons.

Additionally, Trump and Melania offered their condolences on Twitter. The White House Press Secretary mentioned that Trump had spoken with Nevada officials. 

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Trump's address, his plans to visit Las Vegas, the flags at half-staff, the key points from his speech, the attack details, the suspect information, and the ongoing investigations. I'll also mention the first lady's condolences and the fact that the president contacted officials.

I'll structure the summary to start with Trump's address, then move on to the attack details, suspect info, his plans, and the aftermath. I should keep each sentence concise and focus on the most critical information.

Let me make sure I don't exceed the word limit. I'll check each point and ensure it's included without unnecessary details. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified.

I think that covers all the essential elements. Time to put it all together succinctly.
