SUMMARY:

President Trump addressed the nation on Monday morning, calling the Las Vegas mass shooting an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. He announced a visit to Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims. The president also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and other federal buildings. In a somber speech, Trump offered prayers and comfort to the families of the victims, citing scripture and emphasizing the importance of unity in the face of evil. He also acknowledged the difficulty in finding meaning in the chaos, but expressed hope that even the darkest space can be illuminated by a single ray of hope. The suspect, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was killed, and authorities are investigating the motive behind the attack.
