Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should include as many as possible without making the summary too long. Let me read through the article to identify the key points.

President Trump addresses the Las Vegas attack, calling it an act of pure evil. He mentions the high death toll and announces his visit to Las Vegas. He orders flags at half-staff and emphasizes unity through faith and shared values. He prays for the nation and the victims. The suspect, Stephen Paddock, is identified, and authorities are looking for his roommate. The attack was well-planned, using automatic weapons. The first lady also expressed condolences.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's address, the attack as evil, the casualties, his actions, and the moral words. I'll include the suspect's details and the planning aspect. I should make sure to use words like evil, attack, dead, pray, unity, etc., as per the list.

Let me structure it: Trump's address, the attack details, his response, the suspect, the planning, and the moral emphasis. I'll ensure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral terms without redundancy.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to draft the summary.
