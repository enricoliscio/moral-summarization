Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article about the Las Vegas shooting and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also listed specific morally charged words that should be included. First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the emotional tone.

President Trump's address is a key part here. He uses terms like "act of pure evil" and emphasizes unity and faith. I should make sure to include those phrases. The article mentions the number of casualties, so I need to include "58 dead" and "515 hospitalized." Also, Trump's announcement to visit Las Vegas and the flags at half-staff are important details that show respect and solidarity.

I should note the emotional support he offers, like praying for the victims' families and referencing scripture. Words like "broken-hearted," "crushed in spirit," and "comfort" are important to include. The president's call for unity through faith, family, and shared values is a central theme, so I need to highlight that.

The article also talks about the suspect, Stephen Paddock, and his roommate, so I should mention that they were identified. The law enforcement details, like the officers injured or killed, add to the moral framework by showing the impact on those protecting the public.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll have to be selective but ensure all key moral elements are included. I'll structure it to start with Trump's address, move to the victims and his response, then touch on the suspect and the broader implications.

Also, I should make sure to include the first lady's condolences and the overall message of hope despite the tragedy. The words like "pray," "condolences," "bless," "killed," and "fearing" should be incorporated naturally.

I'll need to avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and to the point, ensuring it flows well while hitting all the moral points the user specified. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each important aspect is covered without exceeding the word limit.
