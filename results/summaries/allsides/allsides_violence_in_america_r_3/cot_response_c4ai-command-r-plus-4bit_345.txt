SUMMARY:
President Trump described the Las Vegas attack as an "act of pure evil," offering his condolences and prayers to the victims and their families in a solemn address to the nation. The president emphasized the darkness of this tragedy, but also highlighted the importance of unity and the bonds that unite Americans, including faith and shared values. He stated that "our unity cannot be shattered by evil" and that "our bonds cannot be broken by violence." The president and first lady, Melania Trump, prayed for the nation and for the day when evil would be banished and the innocent would be safe from hatred and fear. The attack, carried out by 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, resulted in 58 deaths and the injury of 515 people, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Trump expressed his sympathies on Twitter, and the White House, along with other federal buildings, flew the flag at half-staff to honor the victims. The president also announced his plans to visit Las Vegas and meet with those affected by this tragic event. The motive behind the attack remains unknown.
