SUMMARY: In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, President Trump delivered a somber address, calling the Las Vegas attack an "act of pure evil." The president offered his prayers and condolences to the families of the 58 victims who lost their lives and the over 500 injured, invoking Scripture and faith to provide comfort and unity during this dark time. He emphasized that "evil" cannot shatter the bonds that unite Americans, including shared values, family, and faith. Trump also announced he would visit Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and victims' families, and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. The president's remarks came after the suspect, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, opened fire on a concert crowd, with authorities believing the attack was well-planned and calling for solace and hope in the face of such senseless violence. First Lady Melania Trump also offered her prayers and condolences on Twitter.
