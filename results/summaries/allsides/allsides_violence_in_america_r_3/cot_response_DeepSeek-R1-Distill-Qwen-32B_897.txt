Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the morally framed single words first. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. He calls it an "act of pure evil," which is a strong moral statement. I need to note words like "evil," "pray," "condolences," "bless," "united," "faith," "values," "hope," "innocent," "safety," "fear," "condemn," "prayer," "light," "darkness," "comfort," "grieve," "broken-hearted," and "bonds." These words carry moral weight.

Now, for the summary. I should include Trump's address, the death toll, his plans to visit Las Vegas, the flag at half-staff, his prayer for the nation, and the unity message. I also need to mention the suspect, the police casualties, and the lack of motive information. I'll make sure to use as many of the morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long.

Let me structure this. Start with Trump's address and the attack's description. Then mention the victims and his actions. Include the moral statements about evil, unity, and hope. Finally, add details about the suspect and the police situation. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

I think that covers all the key points while preserving the moral framing. I'll make sure each sentence flows naturally and includes the necessary moral terms.
