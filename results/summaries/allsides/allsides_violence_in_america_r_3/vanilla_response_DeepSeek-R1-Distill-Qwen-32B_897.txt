Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article starts with Trump calling the attack an "act of pure evil." He addressed the nation, which is a serious move. The attack was the deadliest in modern U.S. history, with 58 dead and over 500 injured. Trump is planning to visit Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement and victims' families. He ordered flags to be at half-staff, a sign of mourning.

In his speech, Trump focused on unity and faith. He mentioned God and scripture, offering prayers to the victims' families. He emphasized that unity can't be broken by evil and violence. He also talked about finding hope in dark times.

The article mentions that Trump and Melania tweeted their condolences. The suspect was identified as Stephen Paddock, a local resident, and his roommate was also a person of interest. Authorities are still figuring out the motive, but it seems well-planned with automatic weapons.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's statements, the attack details, his planned visit, the flags, the focus on unity and faith, the suspect info, and the ongoing investigation.

I'll structure it by starting with Trump's address, the attack details, his actions, the speech's themes, Melania's response, the suspect, and the investigation status.

Let me make sure I don't exceed the word limit. I'll keep each point concise. Also, I need to end with the required tokens.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
