SUMMARY:

President Trump addressed the nation, calling the Las Vegas attack "an act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. He announced a visit to Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims, and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor the deceased. In a unifying speech, Trump offered prayers and comfort to the victims' families, citing scripture and emphasizing the importance of faith, family, and shared values in the face of evil. He urged Americans to come together, saying "our unity cannot be shattered by evil" and that even in darkness, a single ray of hope can bring light.
