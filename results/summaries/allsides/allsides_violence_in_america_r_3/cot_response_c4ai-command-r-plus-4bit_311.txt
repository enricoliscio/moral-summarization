SUMMARY: In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, President Trump delivered a somber address, condemning the "act of pure evil" that left 58 dead and 515 injured in Las Vegas. Calling upon the nation's unity, faith, and shared values, he offered prayers and solace to the victims' families, invoking Scripture to find comfort in a dark time. The president, emphasizing the bonds that unite Americans, asserted that evil and violence cannot break these bonds or shatter their unity. He recognized the challenging search for meaning amid chaos and darkness but encouraged finding hope in even the darkest spaces. Mr. Trump extended his condolences to those affected, praying for a world where evil is banished and the innocent are protected from hatred and fear. The first lady, Melania Trump, also expressed her sympathies, praying for the victims and their loved ones. The president ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and announced his visit to Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families. The suspect, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was killed, and authorities are working to uncover the motive behind this well-planned and tragic attack.
