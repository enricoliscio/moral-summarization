SUMMARY:
President Trump addressed the nation, calling the Las Vegas attack an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. In a somber and faith-focused speech, he offered his prayers to the victims' families, saying "We seek comfort in those words for we know that God lives in the hearts of those who grieve." Trump emphasized the importance of "the bonds that unite us," including faith, family, and shared values, stating "Our unity cannot be shattered by evil." He added that even in the darkest of times, "a single ray of hope" can bring light. The president will visit Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims, and has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor those who died. END OF SUMMARY.
