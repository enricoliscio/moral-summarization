Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first.

President Trump called the attack an "act of pure evil" and addressed the nation. He mentioned visiting Las Vegas, lowering flags, and offering prayers. He emphasized unity, faith, and shared values. He also talked about seeking hope in dark times. The article also mentions the suspect, Stephen Paddock, and some details about the attack's planning and the authorities' response.

I should focus on the key points: Trump's emotional address, his actions (visit, flags, prayers), the moral language he used, and the context of the attack being the deadliest. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure to capture the moral tone, like calling it evil and emphasizing unity and hope.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's statement, mention the attack's severity, his actions, the moral and unifying messages, and the suspect's identification. I should avoid going into too much detail about the investigation unless it's relevant to the moral framing.

Wait, the user also mentioned I'm a moral expert, so I should highlight how Trump's speech framed the event morallyâ€”emphasizing evil, unity, and hope. Make sure to include phrases like "act of pure evil," "unity cannot be shattered," and "light in the darkness."

I need to ensure the summary flows well, covering Trump's address, his planned visit, the flags, the moral language, the suspect, and the context of the attack's deadliness. Keep it concise but comprehensive.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll start with Trump's characterization, then his actions, the moral message, the suspect, and the context. That should cover all the necessary points without exceeding the word limit.
