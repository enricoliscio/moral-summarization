Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. The article is about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting, which was the deadliest in U.S. history. He called it an "act of pure evil," which is a strong moral statement. I should make sure to include that.

I notice the user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used. I need to incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary. Words like "attack," "evil," "shooting," "dead," "hospitalized," "died," "praying," "ask," "crushed," "lives," "shattered," "broken," "violence," "chaos," "pray," "safe," "hatred," "fear," "condolences," "sympathies," "bless," "killed," "located," "condition," "wounded," "use," "fearing," "prayers." 

The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words. I'll need to condense the information without losing the moral tone. The key points are Trump's address, the number of casualties, his plans to visit Las Vegas, the flags at half-staff, his prayers, the unity message, the suspect's identity, and the police response.

I should start with the attack, mention the casualties, Trump's address, his use of "evil," the flags, his visit plans, the prayers, and the unity message. Then, mention the suspect, the police involvement, and the ongoing investigation. I'll need to use the moral words where appropriate, like "attack," "evil," "dead," "hospitalized," "praying," "unity," "violence," etc.

I also need to include Melania Trump's condolences on Twitter. Maybe mention the police officers affected. The summary should flow well, connecting each point with the moral framing. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all important points are covered within the word limit.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep it under 200 words. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Let me make sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral perspective.
