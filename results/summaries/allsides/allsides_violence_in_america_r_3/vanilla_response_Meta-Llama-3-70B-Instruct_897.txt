SUMMARY:

President Trump addressed the nation on Monday morning, calling the Las Vegas mass shooting an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. He announced plans to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims. Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and other federal buildings to honor the victims. In a somber and faith-focused speech, he offered prayers and comfort to the families of the victims, citing scripture and emphasizing the importance of unity in the face of evil. The president also spoke with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's Sheriff Joe Lombardo. The suspect, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was killed, and authorities are still investigating the motive behind the attack.
