Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. I should focus on his statements and actions that highlight unity, faith, and the fight against evil. I'll start by noting the key points: the attack's severity, Trump's address, his declaration of evil, the half-mast flags, and his call for unity. I should also mention Melania Trump's support and the ongoing investigations. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, ensuring the moral elements like hope, faith, and unity are emphasized. Let me structure it to flow from the attack details to Trump's responses and the broader implications.
