Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article starts with Trump calling the attack an "act of pure evil" and mentions the death toll. He's planning to visit Las Vegas, ordered flags at half-staff, and gave a unifying speech focusing on faith. He offered prayers, referenced scripture, talked about unity, and mentioned seeking hope in dark times. He also mentioned speaking with Nevada officials and tweeted condolences. The suspect was identified, and authorities are looking into the motive, which isn't clear yet. Melania Trump also tweeted her condolences.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral elements, like the "act of pure evil," the focus on unity, faith, and the hope message. Also, include Trump's planned visit, the flag order, and the mention of the suspect. Keep it under 200 words.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's initial statement, the death toll, his actions (visit, flags), his speech's focus on unity and faith. Mention Melania's tweet. End with the suspect's identity and the ongoing investigation.

I should avoid getting into too much detail about the shooting itself, focus more on Trump's response and the moral aspects. Make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too lengthy.

Alright, time to put it together concisely.
