SUMMARY:
President Trump called the Las Vegas attack an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. In a unifying, faith-focused speech, he offered his prayers through this "very dark period" and sought comfort in the words of scripture. Trump emphasized the importance of "the bonds that unite us," including faith, family, and shared values, stating that "our unity cannot be shattered by evil." He also expressed hope, saying that "even the darkest space can be illuminated by a single ray of hope." The president and first lady Melania Trump offered their condolences to the victims and families, praying for the day when "evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear." Trump will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims. END OF SUMMARY.
