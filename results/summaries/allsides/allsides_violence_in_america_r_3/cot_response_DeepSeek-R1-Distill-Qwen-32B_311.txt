Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down the steps they've outlined.

First, I should identify all the single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "evil," "pray," "condolences," "sorrow," "darkness," "light," "hope," "innocent," "safety," "bonds," "unity," "shared values," "faith," "God," and "bless." These words are crucial for the moral framing the author used.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the key points: Trump's response, the attack's impact, his call for unity, the suspect's identity, and the ongoing investigations. I'll make sure to include the moral elements to reflect the original tone.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's address, then his actions, followed by his words about evil and unity. I'll also note Melania's condolences and the ongoing law enforcement efforts. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is important.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary moral terms. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200. Once done, I'll present the step-by-step process and the final summary as per the user's instructions.
