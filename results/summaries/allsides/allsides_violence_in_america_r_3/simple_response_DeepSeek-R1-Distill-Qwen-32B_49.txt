Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by stating that Trump called the attack an "act of pure evil." That's a strong moral statement. He addressed the nation, showing somberness. He mentioned visiting Las Vegas, lowering flags, and offering prayers. He emphasized unity, faith, family, and shared values. He also talked about seeking meaning and hope in dark times.

I notice that the author uses words like "evil," "dark period," "comfort," "hope," and "unity." These are moral and emotional terms. The summary should reflect these themes without losing the original framing.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's initial statement, his actions like visiting Vegas, lowering flags, and his speech focusing on unity and faith. Also, mention Melania's tweet and the suspect's identity.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the main points without being too detailed. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Let me structure it: Start with Trump's characterization of the attack, his actions, his speech emphasizing unity and faith, mention Melania's response, and the suspect's details. Keep each part brief.

I should also check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Maybe around 150-180 words.

Wait, the user also mentioned that the summary should end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I need to make sure that's included.

I think I've got the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements while preserving the moral tone.
