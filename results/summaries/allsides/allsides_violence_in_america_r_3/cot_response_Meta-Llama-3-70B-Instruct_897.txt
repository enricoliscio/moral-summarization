SUMMARY:
President Trump addressed the nation, calling the Las Vegas attack an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. In a unifying, faith-focused speech, he offered his prayers through this "very dark period" and sought comfort in scripture, which teaches that God is close to the broken-hearted. Trump emphasized the importance of "the bonds that unite us," including faith, family, and shared values, stating that "our unity cannot be shattered by evil." He also expressed hope that "even the darkest space can be illuminated by a single ray of hope." The president announced he would visit Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims, and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor those who died.
