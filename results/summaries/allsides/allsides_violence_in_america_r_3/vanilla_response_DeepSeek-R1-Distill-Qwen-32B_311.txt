Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that President Trump called the attack an "act of pure evil" and addressed the nation. He mentioned visiting Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement and victims' families. He also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. He emphasized unity, faith, and shared values, and offered prayers to the victims' families. He talked about seeking comfort in religious teachings and mentioned that unity can't be shattered by evil. He also mentioned that the nation is searching for meaning in the chaos and that hope can bring light to darkness.

Then, the article talks about the suspect, Stephen Paddock, who was killed, and his roommate, Marilou Danley, who was located. It mentions that one officer was critically injured, two off-duty officers were killed, and the attack was well-planned with automatic weapons. An FBI agent commented on the planning and the use of weapons. The first lady also expressed condolences on Twitter.

So, the key points are: Trump's address, the attack details, the suspect, the law enforcement response, and the national reaction. I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words, focusing on the main actions and statements from Trump, the attack's impact, and the response efforts.

I should structure it by starting with Trump's address, his statements on unity and faith, the planned visit, and the flag order. Then, mention the attack details: number of casualties, the suspect, the officers affected, and the planning involved. Finally, note the first lady's response.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, captures all important aspects, and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I draft it to ensure it's under 200 words.
