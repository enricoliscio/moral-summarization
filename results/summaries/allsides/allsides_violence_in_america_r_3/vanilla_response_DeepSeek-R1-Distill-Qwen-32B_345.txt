Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas attack. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by stating that Trump called the attack an act of pure evil. He made a somber address, so I should note the tone. The attack was the deadliest in modern U.S. history, with 58 dead and 515 hospitalized. Trump is planning to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement and victims' families. He ordered flags to be at half-staff, which is a sign of mourning.

In his speech, he focused on unity and faith. He offered prayers and mentioned God's comfort. He talked about the bonds of faith, family, and shared values. He emphasized that unity can't be shattered by evil and that they seek meaning in chaos. He also mentioned hope and the day when evil is banished.

The White House Press Secretary mentioned he spoke with Nevada's governor, the mayor, and the sheriff. Trump first addressed the attack on Twitter, offering condolences. The suspect was identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, killed by police. His roommate, Marilou Danley, was located, and she was a person of interest earlier. An on-duty officer was critically injured, and two off-duty officers were killed.

An FBI agent commented that the attack was well-planned, using automatic weapons, and it's unclear if it was a lone wolf. The motive isn't revealed yet. Melania Trump also tweeted her condolences.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's address, the death toll, his plans, the flag order, his focus on unity and faith, the speech details, the officials he contacted, the Twitter response, suspect info, the officers' status, the FBI agent's comments, and Melania's tweet.

I should ensure the summary flows well, includes all key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to cover Trump's actions, the attack details, the suspect, and the aftermath.
