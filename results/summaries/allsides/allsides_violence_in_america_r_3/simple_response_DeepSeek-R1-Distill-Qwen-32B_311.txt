Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's response to the Las Vegas shooting. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

President Trump called the attack "an act of pure evil." He addressed the nation, offered prayers, and mentioned visiting Las Vegas. He also ordered flags to be half-staff. He focused on unity, faith, and shared values, emphasizing that evil can't break their unity. He talked about finding hope in darkness and prayed for the nation. The first lady also expressed condolences.

I need to capture the moral elements: the use of "evil," the emphasis on unity, faith, and hope. Also, the facts about the attack, casualties, and the suspect.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's statements, the moral framing, and the practical steps he took. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects without adding my own opinions.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and sticks to the main points while preserving the moral tone.
