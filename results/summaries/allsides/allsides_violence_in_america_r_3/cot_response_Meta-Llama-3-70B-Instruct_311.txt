SUMMARY:
President Trump condemned the Las Vegas attack as an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. In a somber address, he offered his prayers and condolences to the victims' families, saying "we are praying for you and we are here for you" during this "very dark period." Trump called for unity, emphasizing that "our bonds cannot be broken by violence" and that "our unity cannot be shattered by evil." He also expressed hope, saying that even in the darkest times, "a single ray of hope" can illuminate the way. The president will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims. The suspect, Stephen Paddock, was killed, and authorities are still searching for a motive. END OF SUMMARY.
