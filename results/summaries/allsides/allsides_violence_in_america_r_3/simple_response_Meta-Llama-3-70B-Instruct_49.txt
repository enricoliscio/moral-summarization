SUMMARY: 

President Trump addressed the nation, calling the Las Vegas attack an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. In a somber and faith-focused speech, he offered prayers to the victims' families and honored the dead by ordering flags to be flown at half-staff. Trump emphasized the importance of unity, saying that "our bonds cannot be broken by violence" and that "even the darkest space can be illuminated by a single ray of hope." He also announced that he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with law enforcement, first responders, and families of victims. The suspect, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was killed, and authorities are still searching for a motive. Trump's speech emphasized the need for comfort, hope, and unity in the face of evil.
