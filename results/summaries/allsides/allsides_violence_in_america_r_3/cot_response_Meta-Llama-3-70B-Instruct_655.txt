SUMMARY:
President Trump addressed the nation, calling the Las Vegas attack an "act of pure evil" that left 58 people dead and 515 hospitalized. In a somber and faith-focused speech, he offered his prayers to the families of the victims, saying "we are praying for you and we are here for you" during this "very dark period." He emphasized the importance of "the bonds that unite us," including faith, family, and shared values, stating that "our unity cannot be shattered by evil." Trump also expressed hope, saying that even in the darkest times, "a single ray of hope" can bring light. He and the First Lady prayed for the entire nation, seeking a day when "evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear." END OF SUMMARY.
