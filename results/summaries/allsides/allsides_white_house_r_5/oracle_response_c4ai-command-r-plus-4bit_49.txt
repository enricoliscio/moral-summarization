SUMMARY: The Obama White House is accused of suffering from a "60s disease," with its members displaying contempt for America's institutions and the military. The article alleges that the president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, betrayed and lied about the events surrounding the Benghazi attack, crafting a hoax to cover up their betrayal and lack of resolve. The administration's changing stories and evasions are full of holes and lies, with Clinton showing cold indifference and nonchalance towards the sacrifice of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi. The ultimate dispenser of the lies about Benghazi secretly awarded medals for bravery, but this does not make up for the alleged betrayal and indifference. The article concludes that the hoax will continue to unravel, and Clinton must answer for her sins of indifference and nonchalance. 

END OF SUMMARY.
