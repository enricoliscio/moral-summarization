SUMMARY: The Obama administration, riddled with individuals nurtured in the decadent 1960s, is marred by greed, self-centeredness, and contempt for America's institutions and military personnel. This disdain is exemplified by the Clintons' disregard for the uniform and Obama's association with Marxist mentors. The Benghazi incident serves as a stark illustration of the administration's betrayal and deceit, where elaborate lies and disinformation were employed to cover up their failure to rescue American personnel under attack. The emerging details reveal a pattern of deception, with the administration now admitting to "misleading" stories. Hillary Clinton's callous dismissal of questions regarding the incident exemplifies the indifference and lack of moral responsibility characteristic of the 1960s generation. This generation, having learned to dodge responsibility and disrespect authority, now occupies positions of power, endangering the nation's well-being and dishonoring the sacrifices made by those who serve.
END OF SUMMARY.
