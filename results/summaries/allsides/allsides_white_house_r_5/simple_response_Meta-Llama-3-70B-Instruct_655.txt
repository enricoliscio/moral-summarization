SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is plagued by the "60s disease," a mentality of selfishness and contempt for institutions, particularly the military. This is evident in the president's and his aides' handling of the Benghazi tragedy, where they peddled lies and evasions to cover up their betrayal of the ambassador and others. The administration's original story has been exposed as a hoax, with rescue teams available but not deployed. The president and Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, showed cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives. The administration's lack of resolve and hesitation under fire are a stark contrast to the values of sacrifice and duty. The "60s disease" has infected the White House, and its leaders must answer for their sins.

END OF SUMMARY.
