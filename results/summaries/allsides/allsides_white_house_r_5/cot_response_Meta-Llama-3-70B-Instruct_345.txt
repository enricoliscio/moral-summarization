SUMMARY:
The Obama White House is afflicted with "the '60s disease," characterized by a culture of spoiled, greedy, and self-centered boomers who have contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. The president's men and women, including Hillary Clinton, have a history of avoiding responsibility and showing disdain for those who serve in the uniform. The administration's handling of the Benghazi tragedy is a prime example of this moral decay, with the president and his top aides peddling elaborate lies, evasions, and hoaxes to cover up their betrayal of trust. The ultimate dispenser of these lies secretly awarded medals for bravery, further undercutting the administration's original story. The White House's lack of presidential resolve, hesitation, and timidity under fire are a stark contrast to the cheerful willingness to sacrifice shown by those who fought for their lives in Benghazi.
