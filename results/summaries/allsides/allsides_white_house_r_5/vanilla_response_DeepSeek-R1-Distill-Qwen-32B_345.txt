Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi incident. The article is pretty detailed and has a lot of specific claims. First, I should read through it to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about the "60s disease" affecting the Obama White House, referring to the influence of the baby boomer generation. It mentions that the administration is filled with boomers who were spoiled, greedy, and self-centered, which affected their policies and decisions. The Clintons are criticized for their contempt for the military, with Bubba (Bill Clinton) avoiding the draft and Hillary treating military personnel poorly. 

Barack Obama is portrayed as someone influenced by radicals like Bill Ayers and Marxists who taught him to distrust America. The article then focuses on the Benghazi attack, where the administration allegedly lied about the circumstances, blaming a video instead of acknowledging it as a terrorist attack. It mentions that rescue teams were available but not deployed, leading to more deaths. The administration's changing stories and eventual admission that parts were misleading are highlighted. Hillary Clinton is criticized for her indifference, and the article suggests that the administration's actions show a lack of understanding of sacrifice and duty.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. I should include the main accusations: the influence of the 60s generation, contempt for the military, Obama's upbringing and mentors, the Benghazi incident details, the lies told, the rescue teams not being used, and the criticism of Hillary Clinton. I'll make sure to mention the key points without getting too bogged down in specifics.

Let me structure it: start with the overall criticism of the administration, mention the 60s influence, then move to Obama's background, the Benghazi attack details, the lies and cover-up, the rescue teams issue, and end with the critique of Hillary and the administration's failure to understand sacrifice.

I should keep each sentence concise and ensure the summary flows logically from one point to the next. Also, I need to stay within the word limit, so I'll avoid adding extra details that aren't essential to the main narrative.

After drafting, I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words and that all key points are included without being too verbose. Finally, I'll ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone, which is critical of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi incident and their perceived disdain for military service.
