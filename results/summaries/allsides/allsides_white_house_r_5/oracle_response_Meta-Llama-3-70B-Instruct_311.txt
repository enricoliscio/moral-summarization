SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is afflicted with the "60s disease," characterized by a culture of greed, self-centeredness, and contempt for institutions and the military. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, have demonstrated a lack of responsibility and a willingness to peddle lies and evasions to cover up their betrayal of trust in the Benghazi tragedy. They have shown a desperate attempt to conceal the truth, plugging holes in their story with bigger lies, and have been led by a culture of avoidance and dodging responsibility. The administration's original story about Benghazi has been exposed as a hoax, and their changing versions of the night of terror are full of holes. The president's men have demonstrated a lack of willingness to listen to rescue teams and have turned aside questions about official fear and funk with a chilling nonchalance. The ultimate dispenser of lies has secretly awarded medals for bravery, further undercutting the administration's story. The unraveling of the hoax will continue to expose the administration's sins of cold indifference and betrayal.

END OF SUMMARY.
