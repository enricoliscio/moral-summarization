Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is asking for a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with specific tokens. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's critical of the Obama administration, particularly the Clintons, regarding the Benghazi incident. The author accuses them of lying and showing contempt for the military. 

I need to capture the moral judgment here. The article uses strong language, so the summary should reflect that tone. I'll mention the '60s disease, the boomers' attitude, and the betrayal in Benghazi. 

I should also include specific details like the medals awarded, the rescue teams not being used, and Hillary's dismissive comment. These points highlight the moral failing and deceit.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the critique, then detail the Benghazi incident, the lies, and the consequences. Keeping it concise but covering all key moral points is essential.

Finally, I'll make sure to end with the required tokens and keep the word count under 200. I'll review the summary to ensure it's clear and maintains the original moral stance.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly the Clintons, for their perceived moral failings and contempt for military service. It accuses them of lying about the Benghazi incident, where Ambassador Chris Stevens and others were killed, and highlights the administration's attempt to cover up their negligence. The author alleges that rescue teams were available but not deployed, and that the administration peddled false narratives to protect their political interests. Hillary Clinton's dismissive attitude toward the incident is condemned, as is the broader cultural rot of the 1960s, which the author claims influenced the boomer generation's self-centered and anti-institutional mindset. The article concludes by emphasizing the moral failure of the administration's actions and their disregard for the sacrifices of those who served. END OF SUMMARY.
