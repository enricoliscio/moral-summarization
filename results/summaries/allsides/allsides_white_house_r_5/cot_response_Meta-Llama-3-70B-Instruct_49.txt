SUMMARY:
The Obama White House is afflicted with the "60s disease," characterized by a culture of spoiled, greedy, and self-centered boomers who have contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. The president's men and women, including Hillary Clinton, have a history of avoiding responsibility for their blunders and showing contempt for the uniform. The administration's handling of the Benghazi tragedy is a prime example of this betrayal of trust, with the president and his top aides peddling elaborate lies, evasions, and prevarications to cover up their mistakes. The ultimate dispenser of these lies secretly awarded medals for bravery, further undercutting the administration's original story. The White House's fakery and prevarication will continue to unravel, revealing a lack of presidential resolve and timidity under fire. Hillary Clinton must answer for her sins of cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi. END OF SUMMARY.
