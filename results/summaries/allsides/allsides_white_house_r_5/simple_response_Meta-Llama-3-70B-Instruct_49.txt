SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is plagued by the "60s disease," a terminal affliction characterized by a culture of selfishness, greed, and contempt for institutions, particularly the military. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, have demonstrated a callous disregard for the lives of those who serve, as evident in their handling of the Benghazi tragedy. They peddled lies and evasions to cover up their betrayal of trust, leaving Americans to die in Benghazi. The administration's original story has been exposed as a hoax, with rescue teams available but not deployed. The president and his officials have shown a chilling indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives, with Hillary Clinton's "What difference, at this point, does it make?" response epitomizing the era's moral decay. The "60s disease" has infected the White House, and its leaders must be held accountable for their sins of omission and commission.

END OF SUMMARY.
