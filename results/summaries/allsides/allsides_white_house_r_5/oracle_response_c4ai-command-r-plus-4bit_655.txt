SUMMARY: The Obama White House is accused of suffering from a "60s disease," with the president's men and women being characterized as spoiled, greedy, and self-centered individuals who lack respect for the nation's institutions, particularly the military. The article alleges that President Obama and his top aides, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, peddled lies, evasions, and disinformation following the Benghazi attack to cover up their betrayal and indifference to the plight of those involved. The administration's changing stories and misleading tales are highlighted, with the media's alleged collusion and indifference also being mentioned. The ultimate dispenser of the lies about Benghazi secretly awarded medals for bravery, while the administration continues to unravel the hoax. The article criticizes Hillary Clinton's cold indifference and lack of understanding regarding the compelling appeal of sacrifice and willingness to go above and beyond. The author paints a picture of a White House that is out of touch with American values and morals, with its members more concerned with self-interest than the well-being of the nation.
