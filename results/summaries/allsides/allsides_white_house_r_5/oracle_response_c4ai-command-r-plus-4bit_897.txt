SUMMARY: The Obama administration, particularly the president and his top aides, are accused of betraying and abandoning the US ambassador and others in Benghazi, Libya. The administration is alleged to have lied and crafted a hoax to cover up their betrayal and indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives. The author traces the moral failing to the 1960s, when the culture allegedly began to rot, and the president's advisers were nurtured, becoming greedy, self-centered, and contemptuous of America's institutions and military. The Clinton administration is also criticized for its contempt for the military, with Bubba dodging the draft and both Clintons treating military aides with indifference. The author suggests that Obama's upbringing abroad and association with Bill Ayers and Marxists influenced his negative views of America. The administration's changing and misleading stories about Benghazi are detailed, highlighting the availability of rescue teams that were not utilized. The ultimate dispenser of the lies about Benghazi secretly awarded bravery medals, which the newspaper sees as a belated attempt at conscience salving. The lies and indifference of the Obama administration are contrasted with the sacrifice and willingness of those who fought and died in Benghazi.
END OF SUMMARY.
