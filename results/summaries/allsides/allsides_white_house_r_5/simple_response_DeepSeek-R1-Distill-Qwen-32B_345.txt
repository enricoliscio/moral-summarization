Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is critical of the Obama administration, particularly focusing on the Benghazi incident. It accuses the administration of lying and covering up the truth, blaming the '60s generation for their attitudes towards responsibility and institutions. The language is quite harsh, using terms like "spoiled," "greedy," and "contempt for the nation's institutions."

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral judgment. The key points are the criticism of boomers, the Clintons' disdain for the military, Obama's background, and the Benghazi cover-up. I should mention the lies, the delayed rescue mission, and the medals awarded to distract from the truth.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the main accusations: the administration's deceit, the failure to aid the ambassador, and the broader moral failing of the '60s generation. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it, making sure to include all critical elements without losing the moral tone. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within limits. Okay, that should cover everything the user asked for.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly the Benghazi incident, as a manifestation of the moral failings of the 1960s generation. It accuses the boomer cohort, including Obama and Hillary Clinton, of being self-centered, contemptuous of institutions, and indifferent to duty. The piece alleges that the administration lied about the Benghazi attack, hiding the fact that rescue forces were available but not deployed. It highlights Clinton's dismissive attitude toward the situation and the administration's attempt to cover up its negligence by awarding medals to divert attention. The article paints a picture of a leadership class disconnected from American values, with a focus on their disdain for military service and their inability to comprehend the importance of sacrifice. The moral framing emphasizes betrayal, deceit, and a lack of accountability, reflecting the author's view of a culture corrupted by the 1960s. END OF SUMMARY.
