SUMMARY:
The Obama White House is afflicted with the "â€˜60s disease," characterized by spoiled, greedy, and self-centered individuals who show contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. The president and his top aides, including Hillary Clinton, peddled elaborate lies, evasions, and prevarications about the Benghazi tragedy, betraying the trust of their own ambassador and others. The administration's original story was full of holes, plugged with bigger lies, and only now do they admit that parts of their stories were "misleading." Hillary Clinton's cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi is particularly chilling. The hoax, with its vivid implications of the lack of presidential resolve and timidity under fire, will continue to unravel. END OF SUMMARY.
