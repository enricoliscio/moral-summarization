SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is afflicted with "the '60s disease," a terminal condition characterized by selfishness, greed, and contempt for the nation's institutions. The president and his aides, products of the 1960s, have a history of avoiding responsibility, dodging duty, and betraying trust. In the Benghazi tragedy, they peddled lies, evasions, and prevarications to cover up their betrayal, leaving Americans to fight for their lives. The administration's original story was a hoax, full of holes, and only now do they admit that parts of it were "misleading." Hillary Clinton's nonchalance and indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives are particularly egregious, exemplifying the "sins of cold indifference." The White House's desperation to keep the hoax afloat until after the election is a testament to their lack of presidential resolve and willingness to sacrifice. The unfolding truth about Benghazi is a tragedy that will continue to unravel, exposing the administration's contempt for the nation's institutions and the men and women who wear the uniform.
