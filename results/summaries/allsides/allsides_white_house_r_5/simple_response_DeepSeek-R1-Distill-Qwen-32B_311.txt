Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is pretty critical of the Obama administration, especially regarding the Benghazi incident. I need to make sure I capture the main points without adding my own bias. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It talks about the "60s disease" affecting the Obama administration, implying a negative influence from the 60s counterculture. The article mentions the Clintons' contempt for the military and Obama's upbringing abroad, which supposedly made him disconnected from America. There's a lot about the Benghazi attack and how the administration lied about it, using terms like "elaborate lies" and "hoax."

I need to summarize this in under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the main themes: the 60s influence, the Clintons' attitude towards the military, Obama's background, and the Benghazi cover-up. I should mention the lies and the administration's attempts to hide the truth, especially around the election. Also, the article criticizes the lack of understanding of sacrifice and duty in the administration.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the "60s disease" and its impact on the administration, then move to specific criticisms of the Clintons and Obama. Finally, I'll address the Benghazi incident, the lies, and the implications for the administration's credibility.

I have to be careful to present the information as the author framed it, without adding any positive spin. The summary should reflect the moral judgment present in the original text, highlighting the administration's failures and the negative consequences.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be concise but cover all the key points. Maybe start with the overall critique, then delve into specific examples like the Clintons and Obama, followed by the Benghazi details and the administration's response.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to stay within the word limit and preserve the original moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly the Clintons and Obama himself, for embodying the so-called "60s disease" â€” a legacy of selfishness, contempt for institutions, and avoidance of responsibility. It accuses them of fostering a culture of lies and deception, particularly in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack, where the administration allegedly concealed the truth to protect its political interests. Hillary Clinton is portrayed as indifferent to the plight of those involved, while Obama is criticized for his lack of connection to American values and his ties to controversial figures. The article highlights the administration's alleged manipulation of information, including false claims about the cause of the attack and the withholding of rescue efforts, as part of a larger pattern of betrayal and moral failure. END OF SUMMARY.
