Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The article is pretty critical of the Obama administration, especially regarding the Benghazi incident. The author uses a lot of strong, negative words to describe the administration's actions and the people involved.

First, I should identify the key points. The main issue is the handling of the Benghazi attack and the subsequent cover-up. The author accuses the administration of lying, evading responsibility, and showing contempt for military personnel. There's also a mention of Hillary Clinton's involvement and her dismissive attitude towards the situation.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words like "rot," "contempt," "betrayed," "lies," "hoax," "disinformation," "fakery," "betrayal," "desperate," "cover," "sins," "nonchalance," and others. These words are crucial for maintaining the author's critical tone.

I should structure the summary to highlight the administration's failure to act, the lies told to cover up their actions, and the contempt shown towards the military. Also, mention the rescue teams being held back and the medals awarded as a way to cover their tracks.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main issue, then the administration's actions, the lies, the contempt, and the consequences. I'll make sure to include the key moral terms to reflect the author's framing.

Let me draft it step by step. Begin with the Benghazi incident, mention the administration's betrayal of trust, their lies and evasions, the contempt for the military, Hillary's nonchalance, the rescue teams not being sent, and the medals as a cover-up. Conclude with the administration's failure to understand sacrifice and the unraveling of the hoax.

I think that covers all the main points and the moral framing. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.
