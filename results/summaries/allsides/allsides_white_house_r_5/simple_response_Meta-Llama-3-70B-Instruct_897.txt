SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is plagued by the "60s disease," characterized by a culture of selfishness, greed, and contempt for American institutions, particularly the military. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, have a history of disrespecting the uniform and the people who wear it. This moral decay is rooted in their upbringing and influences, such as Bill Ayers and Marxist mentors, which taught them to view America as flawed and in need of transformation. This mindset led to the betrayal of trust in Benghazi, where the administration peddled lies and deceit to cover up their failures. The truth is slowly emerging, revealing the administration's cowardice and lack of resolve in the face of danger. Hillary Clinton's cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi is particularly egregious, exemplifying the "60s disease" of prioritizing self-interest over sacrifice and duty.

END OF SUMMARY.
