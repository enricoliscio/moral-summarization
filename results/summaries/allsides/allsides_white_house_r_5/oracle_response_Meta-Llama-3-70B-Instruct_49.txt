SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is afflicted with "the '60s disease," characterized by a culture of rot, greed, and self-centeredness. The president and his aides, mostly boomers, have contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. They peddled lies, evasions, and prevarications to cover up the betrayal of the trust of their own ambassador and others in Benghazi. The administration's original story about the tragedy was full of holes, plugged with bigger lies. The president had rescue teams readily available but refused to listen to their begging to go for a rescue. Instead, he awarded medals for bravery in secret, further undercutting his administration's story. The ultimate dispenser of the lies about Benghazi, Hillary Clinton, must answer for her sins of cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives. Her nonchalance, "What difference, at this point, does it make?" is chilling. The hoax will continue to unravel, revealing the administration's lack of presidential resolve and hesitation under fire.
