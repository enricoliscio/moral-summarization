SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the Obama White House, particularly the president and his top aides, including Hillary Clinton, for their handling of the Benghazi tragedy. The author argues that the administration's lies, evasions, and prevarications about the event are a result of their "60s disease" - a spoiled, greedy, and self-centered mentality nurtured in the 1960s. The article claims that Obama and Clinton have a history of contempt for the military and institutions, and that Obama's upbringing abroad and associations with radicals like Bill Ayers have shaped his views. The article reveals that rescue teams were available in Tripoli but were not sent to Benghazi, and that the administration's changing versions of the event are full of holes. The author concludes that the administration's lies will continue to unravel and that Hillary Clinton must answer for her cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi.
