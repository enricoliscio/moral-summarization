SUMMARY:

The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly the president and Hillary Clinton, for their handling of the Benghazi attack. It accuses them of lying, evading, and spreading disinformation to cover up their betrayal of the ambassador and others who died in the attack. The article suggests that the administration's actions were motivated by a desire to avoid taking responsibility and to protect their own reputations. It also implies that the administration's lack of respect for the military and its institutions is rooted in the cultural values of the 1960s, which emphasized self-indulgence and contempt for authority. The article concludes that the administration's lies and evasions will continue to unravel and that Hillary Clinton must answer for her role in the scandal.
