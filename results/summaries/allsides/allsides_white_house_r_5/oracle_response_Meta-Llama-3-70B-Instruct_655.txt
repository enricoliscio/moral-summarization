SUMMARY:

The Obama administration is plagued by the "60s disease," characterized by a culture of greed, self-centeredness, and contempt for institutions and the military. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, have demonstrated a lack of responsibility and accountability, dodging blame and peddling lies about the Benghazi tragedy. They have betrayed the trust of their own ambassador and others, leaving them to "twist slowly, slowly in the stench of Benghazi." The administration's elaborate lies, evasions, and prevarications have been exposed, revealing a desperate attempt to cover up their betrayal. The president's reluctance to listen to rescue teams and his handlers' crafted fakery have led to a story full of holes, plugged with bigger lies. Hillary Clinton's cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi is particularly egregious, and her nonchalant dismissal of questions about official fear and funk is chilling. The administration's sins of betrayal, lies, and indifference will continue to unravel.

END OF SUMMARY.
