SUMMARY:
The Obama White House is afflicted with "the '60s disease," characterized by a culture of spoiled, greedy, and self-centered boomers who show contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. The president and his aides, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, peddled elaborate lies and evasions to cover up the betrayal of the trust of the ambassador and others in Benghazi. The administration's original story is full of holes, plugged with bigger lies, and only now do they admit that parts of their stories are "misleading." Hillary Clinton must answer for her sins of cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi, showing a chilling nonchalance when asked about official fear and funk. The hoax will continue to unravel, revealing the lack of presidential resolve and hesitation under fire. END OF SUMMARY.
