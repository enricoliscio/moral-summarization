Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is quite lengthy and seems to be critical of the Obama administration, specifically regarding the Benghazi incident. It mentions the '60s disease, referring to the boomer generation's influence, and their contempt for military institutions. 

The article talks about Bill and Hillary Clinton's disdain for the military, Obama's background, and his association with radicals. It then goes into the details of the Benghazi attack, the administration's initial lies, and how the truth is emerging. The key points are the betrayal of the ambassador, the delayed rescue mission, and the medals awarded to cover up the lies.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main criticisms: the '60s influence, the Clintons' contempt for the military, Obama's upbringing, and the Benghazi incident's lies and cover-up. I'll make sure to mention the rescue mission details and the administration's shifting stories. I'll keep the tone neutral but reflect the article's critical stance.

Let me structure this: start with the main criticism, mention the individuals involved, the Benghazi incident, the lies, the rescue mission details, and the administration's admission. I'll ensure it's concise and covers all critical points without going into too much detail.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and captures the essence of the article.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly the "boomer" generation's influence, for their contempt for military institutions and their handling of the Benghazi incident. It alleges that President Obama and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, lied about the attack, claiming it was sparked by a video rather than acknowledging it as a premeditated terrorist attack. The article reveals that rescue forces were available but not deployed in time, leading to the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. The administration's shifting narratives and eventual admission of misleading information highlight their attempt to cover up the truth during the 2012 election. The piece also accuses Clinton of showing indifference to the lives lost in Benghazi, reflecting a broader critique of the boomer generation's self-centeredness and disregard for national institutions. END OF SUMMARY.
