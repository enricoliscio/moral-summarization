SUMMARY: The Obama White House is criticized for its "60s disease," with its members accused of being spoiled, greedy, and self-centered individuals who grew up during a time when the culture began to rot. The article alleges that the president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, betrayed those who died in the Benghazi attack and peddled lies, evasions, and disinformation to cover up their betrayal. The writer asserts that the administration admitted parts of their stories were "misleading," and that Hillary Clinton initially blamed the attack on Muslim riots caused by an unflattering video about the Prophet Muhammad. The article also mentions the availability of rescue teams in Tripoli, which the president did not allow to proceed with the rescue operation in Benghazi. The writer condemns the administration's handling of the incident, highlighting the lack of understanding of sacrifice and a willingness to go beyond the call of duty. Hillary Clinton's infamous quote, "What difference, at this point, does it make?" is presented as evidence of her indifference and coldness. The summary ends by noting that the truth behind the Benghazi incident continues to unravel, revealing the moral failures of the Obama administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
