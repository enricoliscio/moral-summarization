SUMMARY: The Obama administration, riddled with boomers and their self-centered, contemptuous attitudes, has betrayed the trust of its own ambassador and others by lying and covering up the truth about the Benghazi attack. The White House, including the president and secretary of state, crafted elaborate deceptions to hide their betrayal and their lack of resolve under fire. The president refused to send rescue teams to Benghazi, leaving Americans twisting slowly in the stench of terror. The administration's changing stories are full of holes and lies, and Hillary Clinton's cold indifference to the sacrifice of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi is a testament to her '60s upbringing. The truth is slowly emerging, revealing the administration's dishonesty and disregard for the lives of Americans. This scandal will continue to unravel, exposing the moral rot at the heart of the Obama White House.
END OF SUMMARY.
