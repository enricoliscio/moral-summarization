SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is afflicted with the "60s disease," characterized by a culture of rot, greed, and self-centeredness. The president and his aides, shaped by the decade's values, have shown contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. The administration's handling of the Benghazi tragedy is a prime example of this moral decay. They peddled lies, evasions, and prevarications to cover up their betrayal of the ambassador and others left to die. The president's men, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, crafted a hoax to avoid taking responsibility for their blunders. They showed a desperate attempt to conceal the truth, plugging holes with bigger lies. The administration's story is full of misleading tales, and their nonchalance in the face of tragedy is chilling. Hillary Clinton's response, "What difference, at this point, does it make?" embodies the era's moral bankruptcy. The Benghazi tragedy exposes the administration's lack of presidential resolve, hesitation, and timidity under fire.
