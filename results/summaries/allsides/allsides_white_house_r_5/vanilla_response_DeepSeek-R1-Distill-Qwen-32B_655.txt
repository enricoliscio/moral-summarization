Alright, I need to summarize this news article. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary of around 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is quite critical of the Obama administration, particularly focusing on the Benghazi incident. It mentions that the administration lied about the events, trying to cover up their mistakes. The author talks about how the White House team, being mostly Baby Boomers, had a contempt for military institutions, which influenced their handling of the situation.

I should identify the key elements: the criticism of the administration, the lies surrounding Benghazi, the involvement of Obama, Hillary Clinton, and their background. Also, the article mentions how rescue teams were available but not utilized properly, leading to the tragedy.

I need to condense this into a summary that captures the main accusations without getting too bogged down in the details. It's important to mention the lies, the contempt for the military, the rescue teams, and the political implications, especially the timing around the 2012 election.

I should structure the summary to first state the criticism, then explain the Benghazi incident and the lies, mention the rescue teams, and conclude with the political context and Hillary's response. Keeping it under 200 words means being concise but comprehensive.

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes all critical points without unnecessary details. I'll make sure to highlight the administration's deceit, their attitude towards the military, and the fallout from the incident.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly its handling of the 2012 Benghazi attack, accusing it of lying and covering up its failures. The author claims the administration, influenced by Baby Boomer values of the 1960s, displayed contempt for military institutions and a lack of accountability. The piece alleges that Obama and his team, including Hillary Clinton, fabricated stories to downplay the attack, blaming a YouTube video instead of acknowledging the terrorist nature of the incident. It also accuses the administration of withholding rescue forces, including Delta Force and Green Berets, despite their availability. The article further claims that the administration's lies were politically motivated, aiming to protect Obama's image ahead of the 2012 election. Hillary Clinton's dismissive attitude toward the tragedy is highlighted as emblematic of the administration's indifference. The summary underscores the author's belief that the administration's actions betrayed the trust of those involved in the Benghazi incident. END OF SUMMARY.
