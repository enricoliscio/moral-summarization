SUMMARY: The Obama administration, riddled with boomers and their self-centered, indulgent mindset, has betrayed the trust of its ambassador and other Americans in Benghazi. The administration, including the president and secretary of state, peddled elaborate lies and disinformation to cover up their betrayal and their indifference to the sacrifice of those fighting for their lives. The White House's changing narratives are full of holes and bigger lies, and the administration has only recently admitted that their stories were "misleading." The ultimate dispenser of the lies, the president, secretly awarded medals for bravery to those who sacrificed in Benghazi, while rescue teams in Tripoli were denied the chance to help. The indifference and contempt for the military, rooted in the 1960s, are evident in the actions of the Clintons and Obama's upbringing abroad. The Benghazi hoax, highlighting a lack of presidential resolve, will continue to unravel, and Hillary Clinton must answer for her cold indifference. The administration fails to comprehend the appeal of sacrifice and going above and beyond, with Clinton's nonchalant response exemplifying the '60s mindset.
END OF SUMMARY.
