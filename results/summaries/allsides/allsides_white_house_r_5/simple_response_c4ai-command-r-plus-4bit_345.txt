SUMMARY: The Obama White House is plagued by what is known as the “‘60s disease,” a term that describes the moral decay and self-centeredness that characterized the boomers who came of age during that decade. This mindset has led to a disregard for America's institutions and traditions, particularly the military. The Clintons, for example, were known for their contempt for the uniform, with Bubba dodging the draft and wearing his avoidance of military service as a badge of honor. Obama, on the other hand, grew up abroad and was influenced by Marxists and terrorists, fostering a disdain for America and a belief that it needed radical transformation. This background sheds light on Obama's betrayal of those who perished in Benghazi. The administration, including Hillary Clinton and Obama himself, spun a web of lies and disinformation to cover up their failure to rescue American citizens under attack in Benghazi. Despite their attempts to conceal the truth, the facts are slowly emerging, revealing a pattern of indifference and a lack of understanding of the value of sacrifice and duty. Hillary Clinton's callous dismissal of questions about the incident exemplifies the moral decay and indifference to duty that has come to define the Obama administration.
