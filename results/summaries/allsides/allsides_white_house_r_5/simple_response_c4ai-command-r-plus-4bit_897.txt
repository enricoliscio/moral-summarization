SUMMARY: The Obama administration, riddled with boomers and their self-centered, indulgent mindset, has shown a consistent contempt for America's institutions and its military personnel. This attitude, shaped by the 1960s, led to the betrayal and abandonment of the US ambassador and others in Benghazi. The administration, including Hillary Clinton and President Obama himself, peddled lies and disinformation to cover up their failure to authorize a rescue mission and their indifference to the sacrifice of those who fought and died. The White House's changing narratives are full of holes and bigger lies, and the truth is only now starting to emerge. The ultimate dispenser of the lies about Benghazi secretly awarded medals for bravery to those who sacrificed in Benghazi, a token gesture that does little to make up for the administration's betrayal. The indifference and lack of resolve shown by the Obama administration in the face of danger is a disgrace and a betrayal of the trust placed in them. It is a stark contrast to the cheerful willingness of the rescue team to go above and beyond the call of duty. Hillary Clinton's nonchalant response to questions about the official fear and funk is a testament to her moral failure as a leader. END OF SUMMARY.
