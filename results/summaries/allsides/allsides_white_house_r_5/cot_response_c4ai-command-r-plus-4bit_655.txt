SUMMARY: This scathing critique of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack paints a picture of spoiled, greedy, and self-centered leaders with contempt for America's institutions and military. The author attributes this to the "‘60s disease", a rot in the culture that nurtured a generation of boomers who dodged responsibility and wore contempt for their country as a badge of honor. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, are accused of betraying the trust of those who served, peddling lies, and crafting a hoax to cover up their lack of resolve and timidity under fire. The administration's changing narratives are full of holes and misleading at best. The ultimate dispenser of lies, the president, secretly awarded medals for bravery to those who sacrificed in Benghazi, while those who begged to rescue their comrades were kept on a short leash. The hoax, driven by presidential handlers desperate to maintain their facade before the election, will continue to unravel, exposing the cold indifference and chilling nonchalance of those in power. END OF SUMMARY.
