Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone. The article is quite critical of the Obama administration, particularly regarding the Benghazi incident. The author uses strong moral language, so I need to make sure to include those words in the summary.

First, I'll identify the key events: the Benghazi attack, the administration's handling of the aftermath, the lies told, and the failure to rescue the ambassador. The moral terms like "rot," "contempt," "betrayal," and "lies" are central here. I should highlight how the administration's actions were seen as deceptive and irresponsible.

I also notice the mention of Obama's background and his connections, which the author uses to criticize his understanding of American values. This ties into the moral framing about the '60s influence and contempt for institutions.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include these elements: the Benghazi attack, the administration's lies, the failure to rescue, the medals awarded, and the overall betrayal of trust. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points and use the morally charged words to convey the author's perspective.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the event, moving through the administration's response, and ending with the consequences and moral judgment. Using words like "peddled lies," "betrayal," and "contempt" will maintain the original tone.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the key points without adding any personal opinions, just reflecting the author's moral framing as requested.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly its handling of the 2012 Benghazi attack, as a reflection of the "‘60s disease" — a culture of greed, self-centeredness, and contempt for institutions. The author accuses the administration of peddling lies, evasions, and disinformation to cover up the betrayal of Ambassador Chris Stevens and others. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, allegedly misled the public, claiming a video caused the riots, while secretly withholding information about available rescue forces. The administration’s changing stories, filled with holes, were finally admitted to be misleading. The author highlights the moral failure, including Clinton’s nonchalant attitude toward the tragedy and the administration’s lack of appreciation for sacrifice. The article underscores the betrayal of trust and the administration’s desperate attempts to salvage their narrative, even awarding medals for bravery to salve consciences. The moral framing emphasizes the rot, contempt, and betrayal inherent in their actions. END OF SUMMARY.
