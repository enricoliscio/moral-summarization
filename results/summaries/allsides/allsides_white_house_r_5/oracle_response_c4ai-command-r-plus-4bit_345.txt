SUMMARY: The Obama administration, riddled with boomers who grew up in the 1960s and were nurtured in a culture of rot, greed, and self-centeredness, has been accused of betraying their own ambassador and others in the Benghazi attack. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, are alleged to have crafted and peddled elaborate lies, evasions, and disinformation to cover up the depth of their betrayal. They kept rescue teams on a short leash and only allowed two members of the elite Delta Force and Green Berets to fly to Benghazi, arriving in the final minutes of the firefight. The White House's changing versions of the night of terror are full of holes and misleading tales, beginning with Clinton's claim that an unflattering video set off Muslim riots. The hoax, crafted to protect the president's image ahead of the 2012 election, continues to unravel, revealing the administration's cold indifference and lack of understanding of sacrifice and willingness to go above and beyond. Clinton's nonchalant dismissal of questions about official fear and funk underscores the moral decay at the heart of this tragedy.
END OF SUMMARY.
