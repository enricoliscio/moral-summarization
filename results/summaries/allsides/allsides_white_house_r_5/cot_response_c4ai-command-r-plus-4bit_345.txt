SUMMARY: The article presents a scathing critique of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, accusing them of "betraying" the trust of those involved and peddling "lies, evasions, prevarication, hoax, disinformation, fakery, flimflam and honeyfuggle". The writer claims that the administration, influenced by the "self-centered" and "greedy" culture of the 1960s, showed "contempt" for the military and crafted elaborate "disinformation" to cover up their "betrayal". The writer highlights the availability of rescue teams and the "firefight" between "terrorists" and "Americans barricaded in a CIA annex", accusing Hillary Clinton of "cold indifference" and a "chilling nonchalance" towards the sacrifice of those involved. The writer believes the truth will "unravel" the hoax, revealing a lack of presidential resolve, "hesitation", and "timidity". The article ends by calling for Clinton to answer for her "sins", emphasizing the moral framing of the incident.
END OF SUMMARY.
