Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is quite critical of the Obama administration, especially regarding the Benghazi incident. I need to make sure I include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article again to identify the key points and the moral terms used.

The article talks about the "60s disease," which is associated with boomers being spoiled and self-centered. It mentions contempt for institutions and the military, specifically the Clintons and Obama's connections. The main issue is the Benghazi attack and the administration's handling of it, including lies and cover-ups.

I should start by summarizing the main points: the critique of the administration's boomer roots, their contempt for the military, and the Benghazi cover-up. I need to use words like "rot," "contempt," "betrayed," "lies," "hoax," "disinformation," etc.

I also need to mention the specific details about the rescue teams and how the administration tried to cover up their actions. The article ends by emphasizing the moral failure and the need for accountability, so I should include terms like "sins," "nonchalance," and "tragedy."

Let me structure the summary: start with the critique of the administration, mention the Benghazi incident, detail the cover-up, and conclude with the moral implications. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and include as many of the listed moral terms as possible without making it too verbose.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point without losing the moral framing. Maybe start with the overall critique, then delve into the specifics of Benghazi, and end with the consequences and the call for accountability.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the key moral words and maintain the critical tone of the original article.
