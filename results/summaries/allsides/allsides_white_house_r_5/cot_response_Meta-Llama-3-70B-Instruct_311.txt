SUMMARY:
The Obama White House suffers from "the '60s disease," characterized by spoiled, greedy, and self-centered boomers who show contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. The president and his top aides, including Hillary Clinton, peddled elaborate lies, evasions, and prevarication about the Benghazi tragedy, betraying the trust of their own ambassador and others. The administration's original story is full of holes, plugged with bigger lies, and only now do they admit that parts of their stories are "misleading." Hillary Clinton must answer for her sins of cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi, showing a chilling nonchalance when asked about official fear and funk. The hoax will continue to unravel, revealing the lack of presidential resolve and hesitation under fire. END OF SUMMARY.
