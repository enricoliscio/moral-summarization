SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is afflicted with the "60's disease," characterized by a culture of greed, self-centeredness, and contempt for institutions and the military. The president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, peddled lies and deceit to cover up the betrayal of the Benghazi ambassador and others. Despite having rescue teams available, they refused to send help, and instead crafted a narrative of deceit, blaming a video about the Prophet Muhammad for the Muslim riots. The administration's lies and lack of presidential resolve will continue to unravel. Hillary Clinton's cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi is particularly egregious, exemplified by her chilling nonchalance when asked about official fear and funk. The "60's disease" has infected the White House, prioritizing self-interest over duty and sacrifice.

END OF SUMMARY.
