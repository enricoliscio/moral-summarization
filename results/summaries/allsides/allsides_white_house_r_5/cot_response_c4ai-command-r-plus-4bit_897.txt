SUMMARY: The Obama administration has been criticized for its handling of the Benghazi attack, with allegations of betrayal, elaborate lies, and indifference. The administration's top aides, including the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, are accused of crafting a hoax and spreading disinformation to cover up their mistakes and the lack of presidential resolve. The article alleges that the president and his aides, mostly boomers nurtured in the 1960s, suffer from a "60s disease," characterized by greed, self-centeredness, and contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. Clinton's cold indifference to the plight of those fighting in Benghazi and her nonchalant response to questions about official funk are highlighted as examples of the administration's moral failings. The ultimate dispenser of the lies about Benghazi secretly awarded medals for bravery, but this has not prevented the unraveling of the hoax, which continues to expose the administration's betrayal and lies. The White House's changing stories, full of holes and misleading statements, only add to the sense of betrayal and contempt. END OF SUMMARY.
