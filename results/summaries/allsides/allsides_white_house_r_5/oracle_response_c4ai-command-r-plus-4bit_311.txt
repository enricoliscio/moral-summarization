SUMMARY: The Obama administration, riddled with individuals nurtured in the decadent 1960s, suffers from a terminal case of the “‘60s disease,” marked by greed, self-centeredness, and contempt for America's institutions, especially the military. The article alleges that President Obama and his aides, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, betrayed the trust of those who perished in the Benghazi attack by peddling lies, evasions, and disinformation. Obama had rescue teams available but refused to deploy them, and the administration's changing stories about the night of terror were full of holes and misleading tales. The ultimate dispenser of lies secretly awarded medals for bravery to salve their conscience. The article asserts that Clinton's indifference to the sacrifice of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi and her nonchalant response to questions about official fear and funk highlight her sins. The hoax crafted by the White House men, with media collusion, was designed to protect Obama's image of resolve and courage in the lead-up to the 2012 election. The lies and indifference of the Obama administration will continue to unravel, revealing the depth of their betrayal.
END OF SUMMARY.
