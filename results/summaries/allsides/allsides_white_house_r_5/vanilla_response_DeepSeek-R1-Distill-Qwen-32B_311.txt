Alright, so I need to summarize this article about the Obama administration and the Benghazi incident. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about the "60s disease" affecting the Obama White House, suggesting that the administration is made up of boomers with negative traits. It mentions the Clintons' contempt for the military and Obama's upbringing, which supposedly influenced his views on America and the military.

The main focus is on the Benghazi attack in 2012. The article claims that the administration lied about the incident, initially blaming a video for the riots instead of acknowledging it was a terrorist attack. They also mention that rescue teams were available but not deployed properly, leading to the deaths of the ambassador and others.

The summary should capture the key points: the critique of the administration's background, the Benghazi incident, the lies told, the failure to send rescue teams, and the implications of their actions. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and factual.

I'll structure the summary by first introducing the critique of the administration, then move on to the Benghazi event, the lies, the rescue teams' situation, and the aftermath. I should avoid getting too bogged down in the details but ensure the main accusations are included.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. I need to make sure each sentence is impactful and covers the essential points without unnecessary fluff.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, particularly its members' perceived "60s disease," arguing they were shaped by the 1960s counterculture, leading to a contempt for institutions and the military. It highlights the Clintons' disdain for the armed forces and Obama's upbringing abroad, which allegedly influenced his negative views on America. The piece focuses on the 2012 Benghazi attack, accusing the administration of lying about the incident, initially blaming a video for the riots instead of acknowledging it as a terrorist attack. It claims rescue teams, including Delta Force and Green Berets, were available but not deployed, resulting in the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and others. The article accuses the administration of perpetuating falsehoods to cover up their mishandling of the crisis, with Hillary Clinton downplaying the significance of the event. The narrative suggests a lack of concern for sacrifice and duty, reflecting the boomer generation's values. END OF SUMMARY.
