Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The article is quite long and seems to be highly critical of the Obama administration, particularly regarding the Benghazi incident and the behavior of the Clintons. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the tone. The article talks about the "60s disease" affecting the Obama White House, implying that the boomer generation's values are leading to problems. It mentions the Clintons' contempt for the military, Obama's upbringing and mentors, and the lies surrounding the Benghazi attack. 

I need to ensure that the summary captures the critical tone and the moral judgment presented. The key points to include are: the critique of boomers, the Clintons' attitude towards the military, Obama's background, the Benghazi incident, the lies told, and the administration's failure to act. 

I should structure the summary to highlight these elements concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the "60s disease" and the boomer influence, then touch on the Clintons and Obama's background. Next, I'll outline the Benghazi events, the lies, and the administration's inaction. Finally, I'll conclude with the moral judgment on their actions.

I must be careful to maintain the original framing, which is quite negative, without adding my own opinions. The summary should reflect the author's perspective accurately. I'll make sure to include terms like "contempt," "betrayal," "lies," and "indifference" to convey the moral stance.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all critical points succinctly. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY: The article criticizes the Obama administration, attributing its problems to the "1960s disease" of a boomer generation characterized by self-centeredness, contempt for institutions, and avoidance of responsibility. The Clintons, including Bill and Hillary, are accused of showing disdain for the military, with Bill dodging the draft and Hillary treating security personnel poorly. Obama, influenced by radical mentors, is portrayed as disconnected from America and critical of its institutions. The article focuses on the Benghazi attack, claiming the administration lied about the incident, initially blaming it on a video rather than acknowledging the terrorist attack. It reveals that rescue forces were available but not deployed, leading to the deaths of Americans. The administration's repeated deceptions and failure to act are condemned, with Hillary Clinton's dismissive attitude toward the tragedy highlighted. The piece concludes by emphasizing the moral failure of the administration, driven by a lack of concern for sacrifice and duty. END OF SUMMARY.
