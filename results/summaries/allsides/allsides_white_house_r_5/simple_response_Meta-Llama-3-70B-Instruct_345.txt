SUMMARY:

The Obama White House is plagued by the "60's disease," a terminal affliction characterized by a lack of responsibility, greed, and self-centeredness. The president and his aides, mostly boomers, have contempt for the nation's institutions and the military. This mentality led to the betrayal of trust in the Benghazi tragedy, where the administration peddled lies and evasions to cover up their failure to rescue the ambassador and others. Despite having rescue teams available, the president refused to send them, and instead, allowed the tragedy to unfold. The administration's stories about the event are full of holes and lies, and only now do they admit that parts of their stories are "misleading." Hillary Clinton's cold indifference to the plight of those fighting for their lives in Benghazi is particularly egregious. The administration's lack of understanding of the value of sacrifice and duty is a hallmark of the "60's disease."

END OF SUMMARY.
