SUMMARY: The Obama White House is criticized for its "60s disease," a term used to describe the perceived moral decay of the 1960s that has allegedly infected the administration. The article accuses the president and his aides, including Hillary Clinton, of contempt for America's institutions and the military. It claims that Obama grew up abroad and was influenced by radicals and Marxists who taught him to disdain his country. The main focus of the article is the Benghazi incident, where the administration is accused of betraying the trust of the ambassador and others by peddling lies, evasions, and disinformation. The writer alleges that the administration had rescue teams available but refused to send them, leading to unnecessary sacrifices. The article condemns Hillary Clinton for her cold indifference and her infamous quote, "What difference, at this point, does it make?" The writer attributes her attitude to her upbringing in the morally decayed 1960s. The article concludes that the administration's lies and indifference to sacrifice are indicative of a deeper moral rot within the Obama White House. END OF SUMMARY.
