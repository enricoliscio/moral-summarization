Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and the list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using those words as much as possible, keeping it under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how cyberattacks and fears of hacking during the election have affected voter confidence. Even if there are no actual hacks, the fear is causing people not to vote. The article mentions Russia's involvement, Guccifer 2.0, and how the spread of fear through the internet is impacting trust in the election process.

I should start by highlighting the impact of cyberattacks and fraud fears. Then mention the survey results showing high concern levels. The hacking claims by Guccifer 2.0 and Russia's involvement are key points. Also, the experts' opinions on how even the fear without actual tampering can undermine the election's integrity.

I need to include words like cyberattacks, fraud, hacks, campaign, orchestrated, breach, sway, undermine, deter, fear, manipulation, impact, claim, influence, alter, attacking, organizing, integrity, transparency, tampered, tampering, disrupting, cyberattack, pull, disrupt.

I'll structure the summary to first state the impact of cyberattacks and fraud fears, then the survey results, followed by the claims and accusations, and finally the experts' views on the effects of fear without actual tampering. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to frame the summary correctly.

Now, putting it all together concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: The fear of cyberattacks and election fraud has significantly impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned and 18% "very concerned" about hacking during the election. These fears have deterred 1 in 5 respondents from voting, potentially keeping 15 million people away from polls. Russia has been accused of orchestrating hacks, including the Democratic National Committee breach, to sway public opinion and undermine trust. Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russia, claimed to monitor elections for fraud, though experts dismissed this as hyperbole aimed at influencing voter behavior. Even if voting systems remain un tampered, the spread of fear through hacking claims could erode integrity and transparency, leading to post-election challenges. State officials are on high alert, but experts note that Russia may focus on disinformation rather than direct attacks. The fear of manipulation, whether real or perceived, could disrupt the election process and its legitimacy. END OF SUMMARY.
