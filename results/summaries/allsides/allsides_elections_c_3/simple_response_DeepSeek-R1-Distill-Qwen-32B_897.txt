Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how cyberattacks and fears of hacking during the election have affected American democracy. A lot of people are concerned, and some might not vote because of this. The Obama admin blames Russia, and there are ongoing claims of more tampering.

I should highlight the impact on voter trust and the potential abstention. Also, mention the experts' views that actual hacking is hard but the fear itself is damaging. The moral aspect is about undermining democracy and public confidence.

Make sure to keep it concise, under 200 words. Focus on the key points: fear leading to abstention, Russia's possible role, experts' opinions, and the importance of trust in elections.

Let me structure it: start with the impact, then the survey results, mention Russia's involvement, discuss the difficulty of hacking but the effect of fear, and conclude with the need for trust and security measures.

Alright, time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: Cyberattacks and fears of digital tampering during the U.S. election have significantly impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned about hacking and 18% "very concerned." These fears have led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, potentially affecting millions. The Obama administration blamed Russia for hacks targeting political organizations, while Guccifer 2.0, a hacker group, claimed responsibility and hinted at further Election Day interference. Experts argue that even if actual hacking is unlikely, the spread of fear and disinformation could undermine public trust in the electoral process. State officials are on high alert, but the fragmented nature of U.S. election infrastructure makes widespread tampering difficult. However, the moral concern lies in the potential for fear and disinformation to erode confidence in democracy, leading to post-election challenges and voter abstention. The focus remains on ensuring transparency and integrity to maintain trust in the electoral system. END OF SUMMARY.
