Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about how cyberattacks and fears of hacking during the election have impacted American democracy. It mentions that 38% of Americans are concerned about the election being hacked, and 18% are very concerned. That's a significant number. Because of these fears, 1 out of 5 people might not vote, which could mean 15 million people staying home. 

The article also points out that the Obama administration blamed Russia for the hacks, like the one on the Democratic National Committee. Guccifer 2.0, who claimed responsibility, resurfaced to hint at more tampering. Experts don't think the actual voting systems can be easily hacked, but the fear itself is causing issues. People are losing trust in the election process, which could lead to challenges and appeals even after the election.

State officials are on high alert, checking for any abnormalities. The article also mentions that it's not just cyberattacks that could disrupt votingâ€”other physical disruptions like pulling a fire alarm could also cause issues.

So, the main points are: fear of hacking is causing people not to vote, Russia's involvement in spreading disinformation, the difficulty in actually hacking the voting systems, the impact of fear on public trust, and the various ways elections could be disrupted beyond just cyberattacks.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key statistics, the impact on voter turnout, the role of Russia, and the experts' opinions on the challenges of hacking and the effects of fear on democracy.

SUMMARY: Cyberattacks and fears of hacking during the 2016 U.S. election have significantly impacted American democracy. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned about election hacking, with 18% "very concerned," potentially leading 15 million people to abstain from voting. The Obama administration blamed Russia for hacking the Democratic National Committee, while Guccifer 2.0, a hacker group, resurfaced to threaten more tampering. Experts argue that while hacking voting systems is difficult, the fear of manipulation has already eroded public trust. This could lead to post-election challenges and prolonged disputes. State officials are vigilant for any disruptions, including physical acts like pulling fire alarms. The focus is on maintaining integrity and transparency to reassure voters. END OF SUMMARY.
