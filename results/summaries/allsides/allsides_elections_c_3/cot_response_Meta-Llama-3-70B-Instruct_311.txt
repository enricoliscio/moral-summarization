SUMMARY:
The unprecedented cyberattacks this campaign cycle have already had a profound impact on American democracy, with 38% of Americans "concerned" that the election could be hacked and 18% "very concerned". These fears of digital "sabotage" have led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, which could result in 15 million people staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, which are seen as an effort to "undermine" trust in the election. Even if hackers don't compromise voting systems, the internet campaign to spread "fear" of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public "trust". Experts warn that mere reports of possible Election Day hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results, leading to appeals for months and undermining the "integrity" and "transparency" of the process. State officials are on high alert for any signs of "tampering" on Election Day. END OF SUMMARY.
