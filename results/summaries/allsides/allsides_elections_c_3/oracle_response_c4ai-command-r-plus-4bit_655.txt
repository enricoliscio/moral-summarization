SUMMARY: A wave of cyberattacks and hacks during the campaign season has profoundly impacted American democracy. Fears of digital fraud and manipulation have led to concerns about the integrity of the electoral process, with many voters worried that the election could be hacked or tampered with. These fears have been fueled by warnings from experts and officials, as well as claims from hackers and foreign entities. The impact of these cyberattacks goes beyond the potential for actual voting machine compromise; the mere perception of hacking and the spread of disinformation campaigns have already influenced public trust. Experts note that the goal of these attacks may be to undermine confidence in the election itself, rather than directly alter voting results. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering or disruption, whether it be a cyberattack or a physical incident. The moral framing of this article centers around the potential for fraud, manipulation, and the impact on public trust, with a focus on the negative consequences of these cyberattacks.
