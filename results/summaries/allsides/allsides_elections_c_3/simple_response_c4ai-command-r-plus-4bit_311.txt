SUMMARY: With the US election already fraught with accusations of bias and rigging, fears of cyberattacks and vote hacking are keeping millions of Americans awake at night. The impact of potential digital fraud has already been profound, with many voters saying they might not even cast their ballot out of concern that the election will be hacked. This represents a significant threat to the integrity of American democracy. 

Warnings of hacking and public accusations of Russian interference have created an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty. While experts say that actually hacking voting machines would be difficult, the spread of fear and disinformation is relatively easy and highly effective in swaying public opinion and undermining trust. 

The impact of these cyberattacks and the subsequent loss of faith in the democratic process could have long-lasting consequences, with potential appeals and challenges to election results dragging on for months. The very idea of hacking has already caused damage, regardless of whether any further cyberattacks occur on Election Day itself. 

END OF SUMMARY.
