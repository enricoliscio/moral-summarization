Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how cyberattacks and the fear of hacking during the election are affecting American democracy. It mentions that 38% of Americans are concerned about the election being hacked, and 18% are very concerned. This fear might make 15 million people not vote. The Obama administration blames Russia for these hacks.

Guccifer 2.0, who claimed responsibility for the DNC hack, recently hinted at more tampering, but experts think it's just an attempt to influence or deter voters. Even if the actual voting systems aren't hacked, the fear spread by these campaigns could undermine trust in the election.

Experts say that hacking voting machines is difficult because there are so many different systems across the states. However, Russia might be more focused on spreading disinformation to attack confidence in the election rather than directly hacking systems. The fear of hacking could lead to post-election challenges and doubts about the results.

State officials are on alert, but they're also aware that physical disruptions, not just cyberattacks, could affect voting.

So, the summary should cover the impact of hacking fears on voter turnout, the blame on Russia, Guccifer's claims, the difficulty of hacking voting systems, the focus on disinformation, and the broader implications on trust and post-election challenges.

SUMMARY: Cyberattacks and fears of election tampering have significantly impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned and 18% very concerned about hacking. This fear may deter 15 million voters from casting ballots. The Obama administration attributes these hacks to Russia, aiming to sway public opinion. Guccifer 2.0, linked to the DNC hack, recently hinted at more tampering, though experts dismiss it as an attempt to influence voters. Even without direct hacking, the spread of fear could undermine trust in the election. Experts note that hacking voting machines is difficult due to the fragmented U.S. election system, but Russia may focus on disinformation to erode confidence. Post-election challenges and doubts could arise if voters lose faith in the process. State officials remain vigilant, though physical disruptions could also affect voting. END OF SUMMARY.
