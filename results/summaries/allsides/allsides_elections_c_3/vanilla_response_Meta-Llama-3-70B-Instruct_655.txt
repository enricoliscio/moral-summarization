SUMMARY:

The recent cyberattacks on political organizations and warnings of possible Election Day digital fraud have had a profound impact on American democracy. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, and 18% are very concerned. This fear has led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, which could result in 15 million people staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and despite election and cybersecurity experts dismissing claims of Election Day tampering, the spread of fear and disinformation could be enough to undermine public trust in the election. State election officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, but experts say that compromising voting systems would be difficult. Instead, hackers may aim to spread disinformation and erode confidence in the election process.

END OF SUMMARY.
