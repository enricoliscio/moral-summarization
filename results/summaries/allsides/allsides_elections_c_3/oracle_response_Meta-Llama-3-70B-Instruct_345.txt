SUMMARY:

The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, spreading fear and undermining trust in the election. A survey found that 38% of Americans are "concerned" that the election could be hacked, and 18% are "very concerned." This fear of digital sabotage has led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, which could result in 15 million people staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, and election experts warn that even if hackers don't compromise voting systems, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to discredit the vote. Experts note that Russia's aim may not be to alter the outcome, but to organize a disinformation campaign attacking confidence in the election itself. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and the idea of nameless hackers or foreign spies disrupting the election is a major concern. END OF SUMMARY.
