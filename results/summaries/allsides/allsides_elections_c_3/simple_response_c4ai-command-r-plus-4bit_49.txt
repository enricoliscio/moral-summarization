SUMMARY: An unprecedented number of cyberattacks during the campaign and warnings of possible digital fraud on Election Day have already impacted American democracy, with surveys suggesting that fears of hacking may keep millions of voters at home on Tuesday. The US government has blamed Russia for the hacks, which included a breach of the Democratic National Committee, with the goal of undermining trust in the election. While experts say that actually compromising voting machines would be difficult, Russia's efforts to spread disinformation and sow doubt about the integrity of the election may be more effective in influencing public opinion. The impact of these cyberattacks and warnings is already being felt, with state election officials on high alert and the public expressing concern about the security of their votes. Even if no actual hacking occurs on Election Day, the mere perception of fraud could lead to months of appeals and challenges to the election results, further damaging public trust in the democratic process.

END OF SUMMARY.
