SUMMARY:

The unprecedented cyberattacks during this campaign cycle have already eroded trust in American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned that the election could be hacked and 18% very concerned. These fears may lead 1 in 5 respondents to stay home on Election Day, potentially affecting 15 million voters. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and despite experts' doubts about the feasibility of compromising voting systems, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking may be enough to discredit the vote. Even if hackers don't succeed in tampering with voting booths, mere reports of possible Election Day hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and experts warn that disinformation campaigns attacking confidence in the election could be a more effective strategy for foreign actors. The moral implication is that the integrity of the democratic process is at stake, and it's crucial to maintain transparency and trust in the election.

END OF SUMMARY.
