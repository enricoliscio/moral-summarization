SUMMARY:

The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, regardless of whether hackers attempt to tamper with voting on Election Day. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, leading 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and despite experts dismissing claims of Election Day tampering, the spread of fear and misinformation may be enough to undermine public trust in the election. Even if voting booths are not compromised, the internet campaign to spread fear may still have a major impact. Experts warn that merely claiming to have tampered with the election could be enough to discredit the vote and fuel post-election challenges. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and the idea of nameless hackers or foreign spies disrupting the election is a major concern.

END OF SUMMARY.
