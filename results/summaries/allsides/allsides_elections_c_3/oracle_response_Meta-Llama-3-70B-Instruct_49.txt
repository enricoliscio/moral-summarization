SUMMARY:

The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, spreading fear and undermining trust in the election. Despite the difficulty of actually compromising voting systems, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to discredit the vote. The Obama administration has blamed senior Russian officials for orchestrating the breach, and warnings of possible Election Day digital fraud have put state election officials on high alert. Experts warn that even if hackers don't succeed in tampering with voting booths, the mere claim of doing so could compel voters to cry foul and undermine the legitimacy of the vote. The goal of these cyberattacks is to sway public opinion, deter people from voting, and disrupt the voting process. The spread of fear and misinformation could have a lasting impact on public trust, potentially leading to post-election challenges to the results.
