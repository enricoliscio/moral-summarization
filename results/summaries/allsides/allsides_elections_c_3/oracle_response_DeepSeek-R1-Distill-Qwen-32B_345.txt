Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the impact of cyberattacks and hacking fears on the US election. The author uses words like "fraud," "hacks," "orchestrating," and "undermine," which carry moral implications.

I should identify the key themes: the fear of hacking leading to voter apathy, the potential for foreign interference, and the efforts to maintain trust in the election process. I'll need to include terms like "cyberattacks," "fraud," "hacks," and "undermine" to keep the moral tone.

The article mentions that 38% are concerned about hacking, which might deter 15 million voters. It also talks about Russia's possible involvement and the effect of fear on voter turnout. I should highlight the impact on public trust and the measures taken to prevent tampering.

I'll structure the summary to start with the main issue, then the statistics, the potential consequences, and the measures being taken. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to reflect the author's framing. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise but comprehensive.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, covering the fear, its effects, the accusations, and the efforts to maintain integrity and transparency. This should capture the essence of the article while preserving the moral elements.

SUMMARY: The fear of cyberattacks and hacking has deeply impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned about election fraud and 18% "very concerned," potentially deterring 15 million voters. Despite the Obama administration blaming Russia for orchestrating hacks, Guccifer 2.0 resurfaced to claim more tampering, fueling fear and distrust. Experts warn that even credible claims of hacking could undermine election integrity, with some suggesting Russia's goal is to spread disinformation rather than directly alter votes. The fragmented US election system makes large-scale hacking difficult, but the fear of manipulation has already disrupted trust. State officials are on high alert, yet concerns persist that fear itself could deter voters or lead to post-election challenges. The moral framing emphasizes the risks of fraud, manipulation, and the erosion of public confidence in democratic processes. END OF SUMMARY.
