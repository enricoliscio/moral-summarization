SUMMARY: The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, undermining trust in the election. Despite the difficulty of compromising actual voting systems, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public trust. The Russian-backed hacking campaign, blamed for orchestrating the breach on the Democratic National Committee, has led to widespread fears of digital sabotage, with 38% of Americans concerned that the election could be hacked. This has resulted in 1 out of 5 respondents saying they might not even vote, potentially leading to 15 million people staying home on Election Day. The goal of these cyberattacks is to sway American public opinion, deter people from voting, and undermine trust in the election. Even if no actual hacking occurs, the fear and uncertainty created by these cyberattacks could have a lasting impact on the legitimacy of the vote. END OF SUMMARY.
