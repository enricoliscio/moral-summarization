SUMMARY:
The unprecedented number of cyberattacks this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, with 38% of Americans "concerned" that the election could be hacked and 18% "very concerned". These fears of digital "sabotage" have led 1 in 5 respondents to say they might not even vote, potentially staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, and despite experts saying that compromising voting systems would be difficult, the internet campaign to spread "fear" of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public "trust". Even if hackers don't actually tamper with voting, the mere reports of possible Election Day hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results, undermining the "integrity" and "transparency" of the process. END OF SUMMARY.
