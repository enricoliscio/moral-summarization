Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about how cyberattacks and fears of hacking have affected American democracy. It mentions that 38% of Americans are concerned, and 18% are very concerned, leading some to possibly not vote. That's a big impact on voter turnout.

It also discusses Russia's involvement, with Guccifer 2.0 claiming responsibility. The government's response and the ongoing fears are making people distrust the election process. Even if there's no actual hacking, the fear itself is causing problems.

Experts say that the real aim might be to spread disinformation rather than hack the systems. The patchwork of voting systems in the US makes it hard to hack all, but the fear is still effective.

State officials are on alert, but the article emphasizes that the fear could lead to post-election challenges and undermine trust. The moral issue here is about the integrity of the election and public trust.

I need to capture these points concisely, highlighting the impact of fear on voter turnout and the potential for discrediting the election without actual tampering. Also, mention the structural challenges to hacking but the effectiveness of fear campaigns.

Let me structure this into a summary, making sure to include the key percentages, the impact on voter behavior, the role of disinformation, and the experts' views on the challenges and implications.

SUMMARY: The fear of cyberattacks and hacking during the U.S. election has deeply impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned and 18% very concerned about election tampering. These fears have led 1 out of 5 respondents to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million voters. The Obama administration and intelligence agencies have accused Russia of orchestrating hacks to sway public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Despite experts dismissing claims of direct hacking as hyperbole, the fear of tampering has already influenced voter behavior and public trust. Even if foreign hackers cannot compromise voting systems, the spread of fear and disinformation could undermine the legitimacy of the election. Experts note that the U.S. election system's complexity makes large-scale hacking difficult, but the psychological impact of fear and disinformation campaigns could have a significant effect. State officials are on high alert, but the moral concern lies in the potential for voter distrust and post-election challenges, regardless of actual tampering. END OF SUMMARY.
