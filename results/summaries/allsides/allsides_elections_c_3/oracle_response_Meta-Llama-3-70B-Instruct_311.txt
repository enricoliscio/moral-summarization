SUMMARY:

The unprecedented cyberattacks and public warnings of possible Election Day digital fraud have already had a profound impact on American democracy. A survey found that 38% of Americans are "concerned" that the election could be hacked, and 18% are "very concerned", leading 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, which aimed to sway American public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Despite experts dismissing Guccifer 2.0's claim of Election Day tampering as hyperbole, it may be a "last-ditch effort" to deter people from voting. The internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public trust. Even if foreign hackers can't compromise actual voting systems, the mere claim of doing so could compel voters to cry foul and undermine the legitimacy of the vote. State officials are on guard for any potential signs of tampering, and experts warn that mere reports of possible Election Day hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results.

END OF SUMMARY.
