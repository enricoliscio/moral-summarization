Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the query. The user wants two things: first, to identify all single words that are morally framed in the article, and second, to write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article carefully to spot words that carry moral implications. Words like "hackers," "tamper," "fraud," "concerned," "undermine," "dishonest," "discredit," "legitimacy," "integrity," "transparency," and "disruption" come to mind. These words are used to convey the negative impact on the democratic process and public trust.

Next, I'll structure the summary. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes the identified morally framed words. The summary should highlight the main points: the impact of cyberattacks on voter confidence, the potential for voter abstention, the accusations against Russia, the efforts by state officials, and the broader implications for democracy.

I should start by mentioning the unprecedented cyberattacks and their impact on democracy. Then, include the survey results about voter concern and potential abstention. Mention the Russian involvement and Guccifer's claims. Highlight the experts' views on the difficulty of hacking but the ease of spreading distrust. Finally, note the state officials' efforts and the importance of integrity and transparency.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all critical points without being too technical. Also, keeping the language clear and direct will help convey the moral framing effectively. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each sentence contributes to the overall message about the threat to democracy and voter trust.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article highlights the profound impact of cyberattacks and hacking fears on American democracy. Despite no actual tampering, the unprecedented cyberattacks this campaign cycle, including those attributed to Russia, have caused widespread concern. Surveys reveal that nearly half of Americans are worried about election hacking, with 15 million potentially abstaining from voting. Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russia, has claimed intent to monitor elections, further fueling distrust. Experts warn that even credible claims of hacking could undermine the legitimacy of the vote, even if actual tampering is difficult due to the fragmented U.S. election system. The focus is shifting from direct hacking to disinformation campaigns aimed at eroding confidence. State officials are vigilant, but the fear of dishonesty or disruption could have lasting effects on public trust and the democratic process.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
