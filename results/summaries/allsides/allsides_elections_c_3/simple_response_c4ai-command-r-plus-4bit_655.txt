SUMMARY: With Election Day upon us, the unprecedented amount of cyberattacks and warnings of possible digital fraud have already impacted American democracy. Surveys show that many Americans are concerned about the potential for hacking, and some may choose not to vote as a result. While experts believe that successfully compromising voting machines would be difficult due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, they also note that foreign hackers, such as those blamed by the Obama administration for the DNC hack, could seek to sway the vote by spreading fear and disinformation. This has already led to increased public skepticism about the integrity of the election process, and could result in post-election challenges and prolonged appeals. State officials are on alert for any signs of tampering, but the potential for cyberattacks or even physical disruptions underscores the fragile nature of the voting process and the need for heightened security measures. The moral dilemma lies in the potential for foreign interference and the manipulation of public trust, highlighting the importance of securing democratic processes from external threats.
