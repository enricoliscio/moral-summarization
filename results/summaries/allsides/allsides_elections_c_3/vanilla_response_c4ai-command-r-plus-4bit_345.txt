SUMMARY: The threat of hacking and cyberattacks has cast a shadow over the US election, with many Americans concerned about the potential for digital fraud and sabotage. These fears have been heightened by warnings from officials and the public alike, as well as claims from groups like Guccifer 2.0, who have suggested they will monitor the elections for honesty. While experts dismiss the idea of widespread voting machine compromise as unlikely, they note that the impact of these threats and fears could still be significant. The spread of disinformation and claims of a "rigged" election could discredit the vote and undermine public trust in the democratic process, with potential challenges to the results lasting for months. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, but the impact of cyberattacks extends beyond just the digital realm, with the potential for real-world disruptions to the voting process as well.

END OF SUMMARY.
