SUMMARY:
The unprecedented cyberattacks during this campaign cycle have already had a profound impact on American democracy, with 38% of Americans "concerned" and 18% "very concerned" that the election could be hacked. These fears of digital "sabotage" have led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, which could result in 15 million people staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and despite election and cybersecurity experts dismissing claims of Election Day tampering as "hyperbole", the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public trust. The goal of these hackers is to "undermine" trust in the election and sway public opinion. State officials are on high alert for any signs of "tampering" and are working to ensure the "integrity" and "transparency" of the voting process. END OF SUMMARY.
