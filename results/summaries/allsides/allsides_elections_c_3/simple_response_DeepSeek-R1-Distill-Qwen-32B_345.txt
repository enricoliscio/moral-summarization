Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. The article is about cyberattacks and their impact on the U.S. election. The user wants a summary under 200 words, ending with specific tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about how even if hackers don't tamper with voting, the fear they've created is affecting democracy. A lot of people are concerned, and some might not vote because of this. The article mentions Russia's involvement, Guccifer 2.0, and the effect on public trust. Experts say actual hacking is hard but spreading fear is easier and impactful.

I need to highlight the moral issues here: the erosion of trust, the potential voter turnout drop, and the manipulation through fear rather than actual attacks. I should also include the experts' opinions on the difficulty of hacking versus the ease of causing distrust.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the main impact (erosion of trust), then mention the survey results, the possible voter abstention, the accusations against Russia, Guccifer's claims, expert views, and the conclusion about the importance of trust in elections.

I should keep each sentence concise and make sure the moral framing is clearâ€”emphasizing the negative effects on democracy and voter confidence. Avoid technical jargon to keep it accessible.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring I cover all key points without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: The fear of cyberattacks on the U.S. election has already had a significant impact on American democracy, even if no actual tampering occurs. A survey found that 56% of Americans are concerned about election hacking, with 15 million potentially abstaining from voting. The Obama administration blamed Russia for orchestrating hacks, such as the DNC breach, to sway public opinion. Guccifer 2.0, a hacker linked to Russia, recently hinted at more tampering, though experts dismissed it as hyperbole aimed at undermining trust. While hacking voting systems is difficult due to the fragmented U.S. election infrastructure, spreading fear of fraud could be more effective in discrediting the election. Experts warn that even credible claims of hacking could lead to post-election challenges and prolonged disputes. State officials are vigilant, but the psychological impact of fear may be as disruptive as any cyberattack. The article highlights the moral concern that foreign interference and fearmongering could erode public trust in democracy, making it harder to ensure a fair and legitimate election. END OF SUMMARY.
