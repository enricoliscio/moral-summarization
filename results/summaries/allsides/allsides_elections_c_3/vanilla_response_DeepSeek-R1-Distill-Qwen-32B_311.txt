Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the impact of cyberattacks on the US election. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that even if hackers don't tamper with voting on Election Day, the fear of cyberattacks has already affected American democracy. A survey by Carbon Black found that 38% of Americans are concerned about the election being hacked, and 18% are very concerned. This fear has made 1 out of 5 people consider not voting, which could mean 15 million people staying home. The Obama administration blames Russia for these hacks, and Guccifer 2.0, a group or individual, claimed responsibility, but experts think it's just an attempt to influence the vote or deter people.

The article also mentions that even if voting systems aren't compromised, the spread of fear through internet campaigns could undermine public trust. Experts like Daniel Chiu point out that just the credible claim of hacking could make voters question the election's legitimacy. Ian Gray notes that hacking all voting systems is difficult due to the fragmented US election infrastructure, but Russia might instead focus on disinformation campaigns. State officials are on alert, and there's a heightened concern about any tampering, whether cyber or physical.

So, the main points are:
- Fear of hacking is causing voter concern and possible abstention.
- The impact is more about public trust than actual tampering.
- Russia's strategy might be disinformation rather than direct attacks.
- State officials are vigilant, but the fear is already affecting voter behavior.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key points about voter concern, the effect on trust, Russia's potential strategy, and the state officials' vigilance.

SUMMARY: The fear of cyberattacks on the US election has significantly impacted voter confidence, with 38% of Americans concerned about hacking and 18% "very concerned." This anxiety has led 1 in 5 people to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million voters. The Obama administration attributes these fears to Russian interference, while Guccifer 2.0's claims of monitoring elections are seen as attempts to influence voter behavior. Experts note that the spread of fear, rather than actual tampering, could undermine public trust. Russia may focus on disinformation rather than direct attacks, given the complexity of the US election infrastructure. State officials remain vigilant, but the fear of hacking has already influenced voter behavior and trust in the electoral process. END OF SUMMARY.
