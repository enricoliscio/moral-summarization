SUMMARY:
The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, sparking widespread fear and concern among voters. A survey found that 38% of Americans are "concerned" that the election could be hacked, while 18% are "very concerned". These fears of digital sabotage have led 1 in 5 respondents to say they might not even vote, potentially disenfranchising 15 million people. The Obama administration has blamed senior Russian officials for orchestrating the breach, aiming to sway American public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Even if hackers can't compromise actual voting systems, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public trust and legitimacy. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and experts warn that mere reports of possible Election Day hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results. END OF SUMMARY.
