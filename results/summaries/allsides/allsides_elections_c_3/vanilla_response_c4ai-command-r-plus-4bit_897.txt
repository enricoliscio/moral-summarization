SUMMARY: The threat of cyberattacks and digital fraud during the 2016 US election has caused concern among Americans, with many fearing that the election could be hacked or manipulated. This has led to a significant impact on voter behavior, with surveys suggesting that a considerable portion of the electorate may choose not to vote due to these concerns. The issue has been exacerbated by claims of responsibility from a hacker known as Guccifer 2.0, who has suggested possible Election Day tampering, and accusations from the Obama administration blaming Russian officials for the breaches. While experts believe that actually compromising voting machines would be difficult due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, they also note that the spread of fear and disinformation about vote hacking could have a significant impact on public trust and the legitimacy of the election results. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering or disruptions to the voting process, whether they are cyberattacks or physical interference. The concern over potential hacking and digital fraud highlights the challenges of securing a fair and transparent election process in the digital age.
