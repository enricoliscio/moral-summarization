Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identify all the morally framed single words in the article, and then write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about cyberattacks and hacking threats related to the election. The user provided an example response, so I can use that as a guide. The example identified words like "tamper," "fraud," "concerned," etc., which are morally charged because they relate to trust, integrity, and security.

I need to go through the article and pick out each word that carries a moral implication. These are words that evoke concern, distrust, or a sense of wrongdoing. For example, "tamper" suggests interference, "fraud" implies deception, "concerned" shows worry about something unethical, and so on.

Once I've listed all those words, the next step is to write a concise summary. The summary should be no more than 200 words and must include as many of the morally framed words as possible. It needs to capture the main points: the impact of hacking fears on voter turnout, the accusations involving Russia, the potential for disinformation, and the measures taken to prevent tampering.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral elements without being too technical. I'll focus on the consequences of the hacking fears, the efforts to spread distrust, and the challenges in securing the election. Also, I need to mention the potential long-term effects on public trust and the integrity of the electoral process.

I should avoid introducing new information not present in the article. Everything in the summary should be based on the provided text. I'll also need to keep the language clear and straightforward, making sure it's accessible to someone who might not be familiar with the specifics of cyberattacks and election security.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." and stays within the word limit. I'll double-check to ensure all morally framed words from the first step are included where appropriate, without forcing them in if it doesn't make sense.

Overall, the key is to balance conciseness with comprehensiveness, ensuring the moral framing is preserved and the summary accurately reflects the article's content.

### SUMMARY:  
The fear of hacking and digital tampering has deeply impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned and 18% "very concerned" about election fraud. These fears have led 1 in 5 people to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million voters. Russia has been accused of orchestrating hacks to spread disinformation and undermine trust in the election. Despite experts dismissing claims of direct hacking as hyperbole, the mere suggestion of tampering could sway public opinion or deter voters. State officials are on high alert, but experts note that successfully hacking voting systems is difficult due to the fragmented nature of U.S. election infrastructure. However, the real threat may be the spread of fear and disinformation, which could fuel post-election challenges and erode public trust in the process. The integrity and transparency of the election are critical to maintaining confidence. END OF SUMMARY.
