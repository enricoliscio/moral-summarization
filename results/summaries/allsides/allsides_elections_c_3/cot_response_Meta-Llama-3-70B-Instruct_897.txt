SUMMARY:
The unprecedented cyberattacks this campaign cycle have already had a profound impact on American democracy, with 38% of Americans "concerned" that the election could be hacked and 18% "very concerned". These fears of digital "sabotage" have led 1 in 5 respondents to say they might not even vote, potentially staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, aiming to "undermine" trust in the election. Despite experts' assurances that compromising voting systems would be difficult, the internet campaign to spread "fear" of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public "trust". Even if hackers don't strike on Tuesday, a credible claim of doing so could "discredit" the vote and "undermine" its "legitimacy". END OF SUMMARY.
