SUMMARY:

The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy. Despite no actual tampering, the fear of digital sabotage has led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million people. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, and Guccifer 2.0's claims of monitoring the election have been dismissed as hyperbole. However, experts warn that even if voting booths aren't hacked, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to erode public trust. The goal of hackers is not to compromise voting systems but to discredit the vote and undermine trust in the election. State officials are on high alert, but experts stress that the integrity and transparency of the process are crucial to maintaining trust in the election. The fear of disruption, whether through cyberattacks or other means, has the power to disrupt the voting process.

END OF SUMMARY.
