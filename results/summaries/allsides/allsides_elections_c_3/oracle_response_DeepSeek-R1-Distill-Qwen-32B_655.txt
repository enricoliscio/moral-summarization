Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how cyberattacks and hacking fears are affecting the US election. The article mentions that even if there's no actual tampering, the fear itself is impacting voter turnout and trust in the election process. 

I'll start by identifying the key elements: the impact of cyberattacks on democracy, voter concern, potential deterrence from voting, Russia's involvement, Guccifer 2.0's claims, the difficulty of hacking voting systems, and the focus on disinformation. 

I need to include words like "cyberattacks," "fraud," "hacks," "campaign," "orchestrating," "undermine," "deter," "manipulation," "impact," "integrity," "transparency," "tampered," "disrupting," etc. 

I'll structure the summary to cover the main points: the fear of hacking leading to voter concerns, possible deterrence from voting, Russia's alleged role, the difficulty of actual hacking, and the focus on disinformation to undermine trust. 

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure each sentence flows logically. I'll avoid technical jargon and focus on the moral implications, using the specified words to frame the summary appropriately.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, ensuring each key point is covered with the right moral language. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. 

Finally, I'll review to ensure all the important aspects are included and that the moral framing is preserved as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the profound impact of cyberattacks and hacking fears on American democracy, even if no actual tampering occurs. Cyberattacks this campaign cycle, including the DNC hack attributed to Russia, have fueled widespread concern, with 38% of Americans fearing election fraud and 18% being "very concerned." These fears have deterred 1 in 5 voters from participating, potentially keeping 15 million people away from the polls. Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russia, has claimed intent to monitor elections and expose fraud, further undermining trust. While experts dismiss these claims as hyperbole, the fear of manipulation could sway voter behavior or legitimacy post-election. State officials remain vigilant, but the decentralized nature of U.S. elections makes widespread tampering difficult. Instead, Russia may focus on disinformation to attack confidence in the process. The article emphasizes the impact of fear and manipulation on public integrity and transparency, warning that even credible claims of fraud could disrupt trust in the democratic process. END OF SUMMARY.
