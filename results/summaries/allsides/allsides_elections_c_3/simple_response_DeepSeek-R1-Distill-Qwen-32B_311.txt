Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about the impact of cyberattacks and hacking fears on the American democracy, especially regarding the 2016 election. 

First, I need to understand the key points. The article mentions that even if hackers don't actually tamper with voting, the fear of hacking has already affected the election. A survey shows that a significant number of Americans are concerned, with some even considering not voting. The Obama administration blamed Russia for the hacks, which led to more fear and possible voter abstention. 

There's also mention of Guccifer 2.0, who claimed responsibility and hinted at more tampering, which experts dismissed as hyperbole but noted it could deter voters. The article discusses how even without actual tampering, the spread of fear through disinformation campaigns can undermine trust in the election. Experts point out that hacking voting machines is difficult due to the fragmented system, but Russia's goal might be to spread distrust rather than alter votes.

The summary needs to capture the moral implications: the erosion of trust, potential voter suppression, and the impact of fear campaigns on democracy. It should highlight that the fear itself is a significant issue, even if the actual hacking isn't successful.

I should structure the summary to first mention the impact of hacking fears, then the survey results, the blame on Russia, Guccifer's claims, the experts' dismissal but noting the intent to influence, the difficulty in hacking systems, and the conclusion that fear and disinformation are the main threats. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral framing is clear.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without going into too much detail. Also, the tone should reflect the concern and the potential negative effects on the democratic process.

SUMMARY: The fear of hacking and cyberattacks has significantly impacted the 2016 U.S. election, with 38% of Americans concerned and 18% very concerned, potentially leading 15 million to abstain from voting. Despite the Obama administration attributing hacks to Russia, Guccifer 2.0's claims of further tampering, dismissed as hyperbole, may deter voters. Experts note that while hacking voting machines is difficult, the real threat lies in disinformation campaigns eroding trust. This fear, even without actual tampering, could undermine the election's legitimacy, highlighting the moral concern of voter suppression and the integrity of democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
