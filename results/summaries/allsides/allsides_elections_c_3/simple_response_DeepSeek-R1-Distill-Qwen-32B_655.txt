Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about hacking and its impact on the US election. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article starts by saying that even if hackers don't actually tamper with voting on Election Day, the fear of cyberattacks has already affected American democracy. A survey found that many Americans are concerned about hacking, with some even considering not voting. The Obama administration blamed Russia for the DNC hack, which aimed to influence public opinion and undermine trust in the election.

Guccifer 2.0, the group behind the DNC hack, resurfaced and hinted at more tampering, but experts think it's just an attempt to sway the vote or deter people from voting. State officials are on alert, and DHS is helping them scan for risks. Experts say that while hacking voting machines is difficult, spreading fear through disinformation could be more effective in undermining trust.

Some say that even the mere possibility of hacking could lead to post-election challenges and appeals. State officials are cautious, noting that any disruption, not just cyberattacks, could affect the voting process.

So, the moral framing here is about the erosion of trust in the democratic process due to fear of hacking, even if actual tampering doesn't occur. The impact is on voter turnout and the legitimacy of the election. I need to capture that in the summary, emphasizing the fear's effect rather than just the technical aspects of hacking.

I should structure the summary to first mention the impact of fear, then the survey results, the blame on Russia, Guccifer's claims, experts' dismissal, the difficulty of actual hacking, the focus on disinformation, and the potential for long-term challenges. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all these points.

Let me draft that. Start with the fear's impact, mention the survey, the Russian involvement, Guccifer's claims, experts dismissing it as a last attempt, the difficulty in hacking, the focus on disinformation, and the potential for challenges. Also, note that state officials are on guard and that any disruption could affect the process.

I think that covers all the main points while highlighting the moral concern about trust and legitimacy. I'll make sure to use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon so it's accessible.

SUMMARY: The fear of cyberattacks and election tampering has significantly impacted American democracy, even if no actual hacking occurs. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned about election hacking, with 18% "very concerned," and 1 in 5 respondents considering not voting due to these fears. The Obama administration blamed Russia for the DNC hack, which aimed to influence public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Guccifer 2.0, linked to the DNC hack, resurfaced, claiming to monitor elections for fraud, though experts dismissed this as a last-ditch effort to deter voting or sway the vote. While experts say hacking voting machines is difficult, the spread of fear and disinformation could undermine public trust. Even credible claims of hacking could lead to post-election challenges and appeals, emphasizing the need for transparency and integrity in the process. State officials are on alert, but any disruption, cyber or otherwise, could affect the voting process. END OF SUMMARY.
