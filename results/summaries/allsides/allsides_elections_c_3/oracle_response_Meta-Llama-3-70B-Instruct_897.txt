SUMMARY: The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, fueling fears of digital fraud and manipulation. A survey found that 38% of Americans are "concerned" that the election could be hacked, and 18% are "very concerned", leading 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, which aimed to sway American public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Despite experts dismissing the claims, the high-profile accusation has created a sense of fear and uncertainty. State election officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and experts warn that even if voting booths are not compromised, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking could still have a major impact on public trust. The goal of these cyberattacks is to deter people from voting and undermine the integrity and transparency of the electoral process. END OF SUMMARY.
