Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how cyberattacks and the fear of hacking during the election have affected American democracy. 

First, the article mentions that 38% of Americans are concerned about the election being hacked, with 18% being very concerned. This fear has led some people to not vote, potentially 15 million. The hacking was blamed on Russia, which aimed to influence public opinion and undermine trust.

Then, Guccifer 2.0 resurfaced, claiming to monitor elections for fraud, but experts think it's just an attempt to sway votes or deter people from voting. State officials are on alert, and DHS is helping them check for risks. 

Experts say that hacking voting machines is tough because there are so many different systems. Instead, Russia might be using disinformation to spread fear. This could lead to post-election challenges and loss of faith in the process.

The summary needs to capture these points: the impact of hacking fears, voter concern leading to abstention, Russia's possible role, Guccifer's claims, state preparedness, difficulty in hacking systems, and the potential for disinformation to affect trust.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without going into too much detail. Let me structure it to flow logically, starting with the impact of hacking fears, then the voter concern, Russia's involvement, Guccifer's claims, state efforts, and the implications of disinformation.

SUMMARY: The fear of election hacking has significantly impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned and 18% "very concerned" about digital tampering. This anxiety has led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million voters. The Obama administration blamed Russia for orchestrating hacks aimed at swaying public opinion and undermining trust. Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russia, resurfaced, claiming to monitor elections for fraud, though experts dismissed this as an attempt to deter voting. State officials are vigilant, with DHS assisting in risk scans. Experts note that hacking voting machines is challenging due to the fragmented U.S. election system, but Russia may instead focus on disinformation to spread fear and undermine trust. This could lead to post-election challenges and loss of faith in the process. The fear of hacking, whether real or perceived, poses a significant threat to democratic integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
