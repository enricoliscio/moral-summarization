Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I have to be concise but still cover all the main points.

First, the article talks about the impact of cyberattacks on American democracy. It mentions that even if there are no actual hacks on Election Day, the fear of hacking has already affected voter turnout. I should include words like "cyberattacks," "fraud," "hacks," and "impact."

Next, the survey results show that a significant portion of Americans are concerned about hacking, leading some to consider not voting. The words "concerned," "very concerned," and "deter" are important here. I'll note that this could mean 15 million people might not vote.

The article also attributes the hacking campaign to Russia, with Guccifer 2.0 making claims. The terms "blamed," "orchestrating," and "breach" are relevant. I should mention the accusations and the ongoing claims by Guccifer.

Experts warn that even if voting systems aren't compromised, the spread of fear could undermine trust in the election. Words like "undermine," "manipulation," and "discredit" are key. I should highlight that the goal might be to influence public opinion rather than alter the vote.

The complexity of the U.S. election system makes direct hacking difficult, but Russia could focus on disinformation. Terms like "challenge," "attack," and "organizing" fit here. I'll note that the aim is to attack confidence rather than infrastructure.

State officials are on alert, and the fear of tampering could lead to post-election challenges. Words like "integrity," "transparency," "tampered," and "disrupt" are important. I'll mention the need for a transparent process to maintain trust.

Lastly, the article points out that physical disruptions, like pulling a fire alarm, could also impact voting. The term "disrupt" is relevant here.

I need to weave all these points together, using the morally framed words, without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure the summary to first address the fear and impact on voter turnout, then the accusations and claims, followed by the experts' warnings about the spread of fear and the difficulty of hacking, and conclude with the state efforts and potential consequences.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral and democratic implications of cyberattacks and hacking fears during the U.S. election. Despite no confirmed tampering, the unprecedented cyberattacks and public warnings have already impacted American democracy by fostering fear and distrust. A survey revealed that 38% of Americans are concerned about election hacking, with 18% "very concerned," potentially deterring 15 million voters. The Obama administration blamed Russia for orchestrating hacks targeting the Democratic National Committee, aiming to sway public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russia, claimed to monitor elections for fraud, though experts dismissed this as hyperbole, possibly aimed at deterring voters or influencing the vote. Even if voting systems remain unaltered, the spread of fear and manipulation could discredit the election's integrity. Experts warn that foreign actors, like Russia, may focus on disinformation campaigns to attack confidence in the election rather than directly altering results. State officials are on alert, but the fear of tampering could lead to post-election challenges and appeals, highlighting the need for transparency and integrity in the process. The article underscores the potential for both cyberattacks and physical disruptions to undermine the democratic process. END OF SUMMARY.
