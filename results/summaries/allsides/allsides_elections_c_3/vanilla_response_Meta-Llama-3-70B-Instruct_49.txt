SUMMARY:

The recent cyberattacks on political organizations and warnings of possible Election Day digital fraud have already had a profound impact on American democracy. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, leading 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and despite election and cybersecurity experts dismissing the claims, the warnings have put state election officials on high alert. Even if foreign hackers can't compromise actual voting systems, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to have a major impact on public trust. Experts say that Russia's aim may not be to compromise voting machines, but to organize a disinformation campaign to attack confidence in the election itself. State officials are on guard for any potential signs of tampering, and the idea of hackers or foreign spies disrupting the election is a major concern.
