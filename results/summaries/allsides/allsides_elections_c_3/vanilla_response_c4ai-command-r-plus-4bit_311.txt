SUMMARY: In the lead-up to Election Day, there has been an unprecedented amount of cyberattacks and warnings of possible digital fraud, impacting American democracy and public trust in the electoral process. Surveys show that a significant number of Americans are concerned about the possibility of election hacking, and some may choose not to vote as a result. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, which included a breach of the Democratic National Committee. Despite reassurances from experts that compromising voting machines would be difficult, the public's fears and ongoing disinformation campaigns could sway the vote or deter people from voting. State election officials are on high alert for any abnormalities, and the impact of hacking and manipulation fears may fuel post-election challenges to the results. The goal of these cyberattacks, according to experts, may not be to directly influence the election outcome but to undermine trust in the democratic process. The impact of these cyberattacks and the public's perception of election security highlight the complex challenges facing the US electoral system.

END OF SUMMARY.
