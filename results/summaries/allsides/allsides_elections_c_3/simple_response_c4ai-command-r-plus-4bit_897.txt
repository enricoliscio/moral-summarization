SUMMARY: As Election Day approaches, concerns about possible cyberattacks and digital fraud have already impacted American democracy. A significant number of Americans are worried about the election being hacked, and some even consider not voting due to these fears. The accusations of Russian involvement in the DNC hack have heightened the public's anxiety. While compromising voting machines is challenging due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, experts believe Russia's aim is to spread disinformation and undermine confidence in the election process. The mere suggestion of hacking, fueled by social media and news outlets, could lead to post-election challenges and a loss of faith in the democratic process. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, but the potential impact of cyberattacks or even simple disruptions like a fire alarm, could have a significant impact on the voting process and public trust. The moral dilemma lies in the potential damage to the foundation of democracy by undermining trust in the election process, and the possible long-term consequences of a disenchanted electorate.
