SUMMARY: The 2016 US presidential election has been marred by an unprecedented number of cyberattacks and warnings of possible digital fraud, sparking fears of voting booth tampering and raising concerns about the integrity of the electoral process. A survey found that a significant number of Americans are worried about the election being hacked, with some even considering not voting as a result. These fears have been exacerbated by claims from Guccifer 2.0, a self-proclaimed hacker, and accusations of Russian involvement in the Democratic National Committee breach. While experts believe that compromising voting machines would be difficult due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, they also note that the spread of fear and disinformation about hacking could have a significant impact on public trust and the legitimacy of the election results. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and the Department of Homeland Security has offered assistance to all 50 states in securing their systems. The potential impact of cyberattacks, along with other disruptions, has raised concerns about the overall integrity of the voting process.
END OF SUMMARY.
