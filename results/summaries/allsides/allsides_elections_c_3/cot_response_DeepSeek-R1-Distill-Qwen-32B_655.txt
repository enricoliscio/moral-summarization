Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words in the article that are morally framed. These are words that carry a positive or negative moral connotation. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "tamper," "fraud," "concerned," "undermine," etc. I'll list each of these under STEP 1, each on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, I need to write a summary of the article. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I should ensure that the moral tone from the original text is maintained. I'll focus on the key points: the impact of cyberattacks on voter trust, the potential for voter abstention, the accusations against Russia, and the experts' opinions on the difficulty of hacking but the ease of spreading distrust.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all the main aspects without getting bogged down in details. I'll start by stating the main issue, then move on to the survey results, the accusations, the experts' views, and the consequences for voter trust and behavior.

Let me make sure I include all the important elements: the survey showing voter concern, the potential abstention rate, the Russian involvement claims, the hackers' statements, the experts' dismissal of actual hacking but concern over influence, and the state officials' preparations. I should also mention the broader impact on public trust and the integrity of the election process.

I need to be careful to use the morally charged words where appropriate to maintain the original framing. Words like "undermine," "fraud," "concerned," "hacked," "discredit," "legitimacy," "integrity," and "transparency" are crucial here.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to highlight the key points: the effect of cyberattacks on voter confidence, the potential abstention, the accusations, the experts' analysis, and the overall impact on democracy. I'll ensure the summary is clear, concise, and retains the moral perspective from the original article.

**STEP 1:**

* Tamper  
* Fraud  
* Concerned  
* Undermine  
* Hacked  
* Sabotage  
* Deter  
* Influence  
* Discredit  
* Legitimacy  
* Integrity  
* Transparency  

**SUMMARY:**  

The article highlights the profound impact of cyberattacks and hacking fears on American democracy. Despite no actual tampering, the widespread concern over digital fraud has led 38% of Americans to feel "concerned" and 18% "very concerned" about the election being hacked. This fear has reportedly caused 1 in 5 people to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million voters. The Obama administration and U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of orchestrating cyberattacks to undermine trust in the election. Hackers, including Guccifer 2.0, have claimed intent to monitor and expose electoral fraud, though experts dismiss these claims as hyperbole aimed at swaying public opinion or deterring voters. Even if voting systems remain secure, the spread of fear and distrust could have a lasting impact on public confidence. Experts note that while hacking voting machines is difficult, a disinformation campaign to discredit the election's legitimacy could be more effective. State officials are on high alert, but the psychological impact of these fears may already be shaping voter behavior.  

END OF SUMMARY.
