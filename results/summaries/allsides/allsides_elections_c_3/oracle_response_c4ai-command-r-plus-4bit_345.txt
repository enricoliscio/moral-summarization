SUMMARY: The unprecedented amount of cyberattacks and public warnings of possible digital fraud during this campaign cycle have already impacted American democracy. Fears of hacking and manipulation of voting booths have put state election officials on high alert, and the public's concerns about election hacking could lead to a significant number of people choosing not to vote. The accusations of Russian involvement in the Democratic National Committee hack have not deterred the hacker Guccifer 2.0, who has hinted at more Election Day tampering. While compromising voting machines would be difficult due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, experts warn that Russia's aim may be to attack confidence in the election itself through disinformation campaigns. The mere suggestion of possible hacking on Election Day could fuel post-election challenges and appeals, further undermining public trust in the democratic process. State officials are on guard for any signs of tampering, whether it be through cyberattacks or more traditional means of disruption. The impact of these fears and attacks on the integrity of the election process is undeniable, and the challenge of maintaining transparency and faith in the democratic process is significant.
END OF SUMMARY.
