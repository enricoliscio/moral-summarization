SUMMARY: A wave of cyberattacks and hacks targeting political organizations during the campaign season has sparked fears of digital fraud and manipulation in the upcoming election. These fears have already impacted American democracy, with many voters concerned about the integrity and transparency of the electoral process. Despite assurances from experts that compromising voting machines would be difficult due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, the public remains anxious about possible hacking and tampering.
