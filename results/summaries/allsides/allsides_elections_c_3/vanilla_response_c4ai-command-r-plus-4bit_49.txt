SUMMARY: In the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election, there were widespread concerns about the potential for cyberattacks and digital fraud, with 38% of Americans expressing concern and 18% being very concerned about the possibility of a hacked election. These fears may have led to a significant number of people choosing not to vote. The US government blamed Russia for the hacks on political organizations, but the impact of the hacks went beyond the digital realm, potentially influencing public trust and participation in the democratic process. Guccifer 2.0, the hacker(s) responsible for the DNC breach, threatened further Election Day tampering, adding to the anxiety. While experts believe that actually compromising voting machines would be difficult due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, they also note that Russia's goal may not be to directly influence the election infrastructure but to sow doubt and discredit the process. The impact of these cyberattacks and the public discourse surrounding them could have long-lasting effects on public trust in the electoral process, leading to potential challenges and appeals after the election. State officials are on high alert, not only for cyberattacks but also for any physical disruptions that could impact the voting process.
END OF SUMMARY.
