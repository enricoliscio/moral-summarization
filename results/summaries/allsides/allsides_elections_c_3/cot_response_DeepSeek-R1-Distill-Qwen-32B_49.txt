Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. My task is to summarize the given article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They've outlined two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry a moral connotation. I'll go through the article and look for words that express concern, fear, distrust, or other ethical implications. Words like "tamper," "fraud," "concerned," "undermine," etc., seem to fit. I'll list each of these words, each on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary should reflect the author's concern about the impact of hacking fears on voter turnout and trust in the election process. I'll need to mention the survey results, the claims by Guccifer 2.0, the experts' opinions, and the potential consequences like voter apathy or post-election challenges.

I should also highlight the efforts by state officials to prevent tampering, even though the actual hacking might be difficult. It's important to convey the broader implications, such as undermining democracy and the spread of fear through disinformation.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too technical. Using the identified moral words will help maintain the original framing. I'll make sure the summary is concise and captures the essence of the article's concerns about election integrity and public trust.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing the words and then the SUMMARY section, ending with the specified tokens. Keeping the language clear and direct will make the summary effective and meet the user's requirements.

### SUMMARY:
The fear of hacking and digital fraud has deeply impacted American democracy, with 38% of Americans concerned and 18% "very concerned" about election tampering. This anxiety has led 1 out of 5 people to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million voters. Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russia, claimed responsibility for hacking the Democratic National Committee and hinted at more Election Day tampering, though experts dismissed this as hyperbole. The Obama administration blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach to sway public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Even if voting systems remain secure, the spread of fear and disinformation could erode public trust. Experts warn that credible claims of hacking could fuel post-election challenges and appeals, emphasizing the need for transparency and integrity in the process. State officials are on high alert, but the mere threat of tampering, whether through cyberattacks or physical disruptions, risks discrediting the election's legitimacy. END OF SUMMARY.
