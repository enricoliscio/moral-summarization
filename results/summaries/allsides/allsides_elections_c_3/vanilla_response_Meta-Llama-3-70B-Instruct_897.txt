SUMMARY:

The recent cyberattacks on political organizations and the warnings of possible Election Day digital fraud have already had a profound impact on American democracy. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, and 18% are very concerned. This fear has led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, which could result in 15 million people staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and experts believe that even if voting booths aren't compromised, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking could still have a major impact on public trust. State election officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and experts warn that mere reports of possible hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results.

END OF SUMMARY.
