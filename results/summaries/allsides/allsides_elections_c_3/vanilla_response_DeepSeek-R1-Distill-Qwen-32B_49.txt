Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about hacking and its impact on the U.S. election. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by saying that even if hackers don't actually tamper with voting on Election Day, the amount of cyberattacks this campaign cycle has already affected American democracy. It mentions a survey where 38% of Americans are concerned about the election being hacked, and 18% are very concerned. Only 11% aren't concerned at all. This fear has made 1 out of 5 people consider not voting, which could mean 15 million people might stay home.

The article then talks about the Guccifer 2.0 group claiming responsibility for hacking the DNC and how the U.S. government blamed Russia. Guccifer resurfaced, hinting at more tampering, but experts dismissed it as hyperbole, possibly to sway votes or deter people from voting.

It also mentions that even if hackers can't compromise voting systems, the fear campaign could impact trust. Experts note that hacking voting machines is difficult due to the fragmented U.S. election system. However, Russia might be more focused on spreading disinformation to undermine confidence rather than directly attacking systems.

The article also discusses how mere reports of hacking could lead to post-election challenges and appeals. State officials are on guard, but physical disruptions like pulling fire alarms could also affect voting.

So, the key points are:
- Cyberattacks have made people fear election hacking.
- 38% concerned, 18% very concerned, 15 million might not vote.
- Russia accused, Guccifer's claims dismissed as attempts to influence.
- Actual hacking is hard, but fear campaign could damage trust.
- Disinformation is a bigger threat than direct attacks.
- State officials are vigilant, but other disruptions could affect voting.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main impacts and expert opinions. I'll structure it to highlight the fear, potential abstention, Russia's role, the difficulty of hacking, and the broader impact on trust and legitimacy.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the impact of cyberattacks and hacking fears on the U.S. election. A survey reveals 38% of Americans are concerned about election hacking, with 18% very concerned, potentially leading 15 million people to abstain from voting. Guccifer 2.0, linked to Russia, claimed responsibility for DNC hacks, though experts dismissed their latest claims as attempts to influence voters. While directly hacking voting systems is challenging, the fear campaign itself could erode public trust. Russia may focus on disinformation to undermine confidence rather than direct attacks. State officials are vigilant, but physical disruptions could also affect voting. The fear of hacking, regardless of actual tampering, poses a significant threat to election integrity and voter confidence. END OF SUMMARY.
