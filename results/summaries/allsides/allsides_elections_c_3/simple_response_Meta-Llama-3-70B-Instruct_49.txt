SUMMARY:

The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy, even if no actual tampering occurs on Election Day. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, leading 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and experts warn that even if voting booths aren't compromised, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking may be enough to erode public trust. The goal of hackers like Guccifer 2.0 may be to sway public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Experts note that Russia's aim may not be to compromise voting machines, but to organize a disinformation campaign attacking confidence in the election itself. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and the mere reports of possible Election Day hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results.

END OF SUMMARY.
