SUMMARY:

The 2016 US presidential election has been impacted by widespread cyberattacks and public warnings of possible Election Day digital fraud. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, leading 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, and a group known as Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for the hack on the Democratic National Committee. Despite experts saying that compromising voting systems would be difficult, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking and manipulation may be enough to undermine public trust. State election officials are on high alert for any abnormalities on Election Day, and experts warn that even reports of possible hacking on social media and news outlets could fuel post-election challenges to the results.
