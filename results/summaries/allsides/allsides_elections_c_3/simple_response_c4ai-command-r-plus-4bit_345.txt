SUMMARY: The integrity of the US election process is under threat from hackers, with nearly 60 percent of Americans concerned about the possibility of election hacking, according to a survey by cybersecurity firm Carbon Black. This fear of digital sabotage has the potential to deter millions of voters from casting their ballots, ultimately influencing the outcome of the election. While experts believe that actually compromising voting machines would be a challenging task due to the decentralized nature of the US election system, they warn that hackers, allegedly directed by Russia, may focus on spreading disinformation and undermining confidence in the election process. This has already been evident in the high-profile breach of the Democratic National Committee and the subsequent claims by Guccifer 2.0, who has threatened to monitor and expose electoral fraud. The impact of these threats extends beyond Election Day, as reports of hacking and the resulting loss of faith in the process could lead to prolonged appeals and challenges to the election results. State officials and cybersecurity experts are on high alert, not only for cyberattacks but also for any potential disruptions to the voting process, whether digital or physical. The goal is to ensure the integrity and transparency of the election, reassuring voters that their votes will be accurately counted and their voices heard.
END OF SUMMARY.
