SUMMARY: With the unprecedented amount of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle and public warnings of possible digital fraud on Election Day, the American democracy has already been profoundly impacted. Many Americans are concerned about the possibility of hacking, with some even considering not voting due to their fears. These worries have been fueled by accusations of Russian involvement in the breach of the Democratic National Committee and claims of potential Election Day tampering by Guccifer 2.0. While experts dismiss the latter as hyperbole, the impact of these incidents on public trust in the election process is significant. Successfully compromising voting machines would be difficult, but Russia's aim may be to attack confidence in the election itself through disinformation campaigns. Experts warn that even mere reports of hacking on social media and news outlets could lead to post-election challenges and a loss of faith in the process. State officials are on high alert, guarding against any signs of tampering or disruption to the voting process, be it through cyberattacks or other means. The moral framing of this issue underscores the delicate balance between ensuring election security and maintaining public trust in the democratic process.
