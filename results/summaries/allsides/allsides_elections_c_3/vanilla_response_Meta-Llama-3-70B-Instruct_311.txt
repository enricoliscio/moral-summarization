SUMMARY:

The 2016 US presidential election has been impacted by cyberattacks and warnings of possible Election Day digital fraud. A survey found that 38% of Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, with 18% very concerned, and 11% not concerned at all. This fear has led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, potentially affecting 15 million people. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for orchestrating the breach, and a hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility and threatened to monitor the election. Election and cybersecurity experts believe the goal is to sway public opinion and undermine trust in the election. Even if voting booths are not compromised, the internet campaign to spread fear of vote hacking may be enough to impact public trust. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and experts warn that reports of possible Election Day hacking could fuel post-election challenges to the results.

END OF SUMMARY.
