SUMMARY:

The unprecedented number of cyberattacks during this campaign cycle has already had a profound impact on American democracy. Many Americans are concerned that the election could be hacked, with 38% "concerned" and 18% "very concerned". These fears have led 1 in 5 respondents to consider not voting, which could translate to 15 million people staying home on Election Day. The Obama administration has blamed Russia for the hacks, and despite experts saying that compromising voting systems is difficult, the spread of fear and disinformation could be enough to undermine public trust. Even if hackers don't succeed in tampering with voting systems, the mere claim of doing so could discredit the vote. State officials are on high alert for any signs of tampering, and experts warn that post-election challenges to the results could fuel months of appeals. The integrity and transparency of the electoral process are crucial to maintaining trust in the democratic system.
