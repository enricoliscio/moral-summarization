Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article about the First Step Act. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the First Step Act passing in the Senate with bipartisan support. It mentions support from both progressives and law-and-order conservatives, as well as public figures like Patricia Arquette and Kim Kardashian. The bill aims to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion, and improve prisoner rehabilitation. It also touches on ending inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and helping elderly or terminally ill inmates get released.

I notice the moral framing here emphasizes justice reform, reducing mass incarceration, and giving people second chances. The article quotes Trump and others highlighting the benefits for communities and cost savings. It also mentions the impact on thousands of prisoners, especially those affected by the Fair Sentencing Act.

I should make sure the summary includes these key points: bipartisan support, the bill's goals, its impact on federal prisoners, the moral aspects like reducing incarceration and providing rehabilitation, and the quotes that highlight the significance of the legislation.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll structure it to first state the passage of the bill, then its key provisions, followed by the moral and practical benefits, and end with the implications for prisoners and communities.

Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. I'll make sure to include the main stakeholders and the positive outcomes they're expecting, like safer communities and cost savings.

Okay, putting it all together, ensuring I capture the essence and the moral perspective without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12 with bipartisan support, reflecting a rare consensus between progressives and law-and-order conservatives. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, expand rehabilitation programs for federal prisoners, and end inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home and retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially benefiting thousands of prisoners. Supporters, including President Trump, argue the bill promotes safer communities, provides second chances, and reduces costs. Advocates like Cory Booker and groups such as #cut50 and the ACLU have praised the legislation as a step toward addressing mass incarceration and healing marginalized communities. However, the bill only applies to federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the U.S. prison population. END OF SUMMARY.
