SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark bill that addresses concerns about the over-incarceration of Americans for non-violent drug crimes, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. The act seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentencing for drug-related crimes, giving judges more discretion in sentencing and allowing them to circumvent federal mandatory minimums for non-violent offenders. It also seeks to ban inhumane correctional practices, such as the shackling of pregnant women, and to end "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for drug convictions, except in cases of prior "serious violent felony". The act would provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invest in re-entry programming, offering a second chance to those who earn it. Public figures and politicians from both sides of the aisle, including Donald Trump, have praised the bill as a historic step towards criminal justice reform and healing for communities disproportionately affected by the war on drugs. While the bill is not perfect, it represents a significant step towards unwinding the harm of mass incarceration, which has disproportionately impacted certain communities. The First Step Act will now return to the House for another vote before reaching Trump's desk for signing into law.
END OF SUMMARY.
