SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has passed the Senate with a bipartisan vote of 87-12. The bill aims to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion in sentencing, and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It has received support from both progressives and law-and-order conservatives, as well as from public figures such as Kim Kardashian West and Donald Trump. The bill would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It would also provide a path for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home and invest in re-entry programming. The bill could affect thousands of drug offenders serving disproportionately long sentences and is seen as a step towards healing for communities affected by mass incarceration.
