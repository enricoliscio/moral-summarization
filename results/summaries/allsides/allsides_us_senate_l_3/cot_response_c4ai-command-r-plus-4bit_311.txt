SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. The act addresses concerns about the over-imprisonment of Americans for non-violent drug crimes and seeks to provide rehabilitation for inmates. It reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, allows judges more discretion in sentencing, and bans inhumane practices such as the shackling of pregnant women. The act also gives a path to release for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. Public figures and politicians from both sides of the aisle, including Donald Trump, have congratulated the passage of the bill, calling it a victory for criminal justice reform and a step towards healing communities that have been disproportionately affected by the war on drugs. While the bill is not perfect, advocates applaud the bipartisan effort to address the catastrophic harm of mass incarceration and the incarceration industry. The First Step Act will now return to the House for another vote before being signed into law by President Trump.
