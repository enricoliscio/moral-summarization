SUMMARY:

The US Senate has passed the First Step Act, a landmark bill aimed at reforming the criminal justice system, with an overwhelming 87-12 vote. The bill, which has garnered support from both progressives and law-and-order conservatives, seeks to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion in sentencing, and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. The bill would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It would also provide a path to release for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invest in re-entry programming. The bill has received support from public figures, including Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, and Donald Trump, who tweeted that it would keep communities safer and provide hope to those who have made mistakes. The bill will now return to the House for another vote before reaching Trump's desk for signature.

END OF SUMMARY.
