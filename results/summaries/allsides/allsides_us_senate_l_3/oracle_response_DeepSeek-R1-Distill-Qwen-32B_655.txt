Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the First Step Act, making sure to preserve the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I should focus on those words to maintain the tone and message the author intended.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The First Step Act passed in the Senate with bipartisan support, reducing drug crime sentences and improving rehabilitation. It's a significant reform that addresses over-imprisonment for non-violent crimes, giving judges more discretion. The bill also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and invests in re-entry programs.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, such as reducing imprisonment, providing second chances, and ending inhumane practices. I'll mention the support from both parties and public figures, emphasizing the positive impact on communities and saving costs. Also, the retroactive extension of the Fair Sentencing Act and the end of "three strikes" for non-violent drug offenders are important points.

I'll structure the summary to include the main elements: passage of the bill, its provisions, bipartisan support, moral implications, and the positive outcomes like safer communities and saving money. I'll make sure to use the provided morally framed words as much as possible without making the summary too long.

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes all the key moral points. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words and make sure it flows well.

SUMMARY:  
The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12 with bipartisan support, addressing concerns about over-imprisonment for non-violent drug crimes. The bill gives judges more discretion in sentencing, reduces mandatory minimums for drug-related offenses, and invests in prisoner rehabilitation. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home. The act retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. Supporters, including President Trump, applaud the bill for promoting safer communities, providing second chances, and saving billions. Advocates like Cory Booker highlight its role in healing marginalized communities and ending the "three strikes" rule for non-violent drug offenders. While imperfect, the bill marks a significant step toward criminal justice reform, with bipartisan leaders like Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin praised for reaching consensus on this critical issue. END OF SUMMARY.
