Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the First Step Act while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using as many of those words as possible. 

Starting with Step 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "landmark," "support," "progressives," "conservatives," "discretion," "rehabilitation," "reform," "victory," "non-violent," "imprisonment," "citizens," "communities," "saves," "hope," "second chance," "billions," "unjust," "humanity," "elderly," "terminally ill," "re-entry," "three strikes," "stacking," "unfair," "crisis," and "common sense" stand out as they carry moral weight. 

Now, for the summary, I need to incorporate these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating that the First Step Act passed with bipartisan support, emphasizing its moral goals. I'll mention the support from various groups and the bill's provisions, highlighting the moral aspects like reducing sentences, rehabilitation, and ending inhumane practices. I'll also note the criticisms but end on a positive note about it being a step towards reform. 

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too technical. It's important to highlight the bipartisan nature, the provisions of the bill, the moral arguments from supporters, and the criticisms, all while keeping it concise. I should avoid jargon and keep the language clear and impactful, reflecting the moral framing as per the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The First Step Act, a landmark bipartisan bill, passed the Senate with overwhelming support, aiming to reform the criminal justice system. It reduces mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, gives judges more discretion, and invests in prisoner rehabilitation. The bill, backed by progressives and law-and-order conservatives, addresses the unjust imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home. While some critics argue it doesnâ€™t go far enough, supporters, including advocates and public figures, hail it as a step toward healing communities and ending the mass incarceration crisis. The act, which will now go to the House for final approval, reflects a rare bipartisan effort to address the moral failings of the criminal justice system. END OF SUMMARY.
