Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the First Step Act. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing, which means I should keep the words that carry a moral connotation. First, I'll go through the article and identify those words.

Looking at the text, I see words like "landmark," "reform," "support," "discretion," "rehabilitation," "progressives," "conservatives," "non-violent," "imprisonment," "rehabilitative," "inhumane," "second chance," "billions saved," "unconstitutional," "catastrophic," "healing," "crisis," "common sense," "prisoners," "fairness," "equity," and "compassion." These words carry moral weight, so I should include them in the summary.

Next, I need to write a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the passage of the First Step Act in the Senate, highlighting the bipartisan support. Then, I'll outline the key provisions: reducing sentences, judges' discretion, rehabilitation, ending inhumane practices, and retroactive sentence reductions. I'll also note the support from public figures and the positive impact on thousands of lives, emphasizing the moral aspects like fairness and healing. I'll make sure to include the criticisms briefly but focus on the positive moral framing as per the user's request.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the bill's passage, its provisions, the support, and the expected positive outcomes. Keeping it concise while preserving the moral language is key here. I'll avoid technical jargon and ensure the summary is clear and highlights the moral implications as presented in the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12, with bipartisan support from progressives and law-and-order conservatives. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, give judges more discretion in sentencing, and improve prisoner rehabilitation. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and provides a path to release for elderly and terminally ill inmates. The act retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. Public figures like Patricia Arquette and Kim Kardashian West supported the bill, which President Trump praised for providing a second chance to those who earn it while saving billions. Advocates, including the ACLU, called it a step toward healing and unwinding the harm of mass incarceration, though some criticized it as imperfect. The bill focuses on federal prisoners, addressing the crisis of over-incarceration and promoting fairness and compassion in the justice system. END OF SUMMARY.
