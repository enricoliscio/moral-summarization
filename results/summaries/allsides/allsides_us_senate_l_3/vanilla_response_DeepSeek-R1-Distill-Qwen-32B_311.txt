Okay, I need to summarize this article about the First Step Act. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a bill that's been passed by the Senate with bipartisan support. It's aimed at reforming the criminal justice system, particularly focusing on reducing sentences for drug crimes and improving prisoner rehabilitation. 

So, the key points I should include are: the bill passed 87-12 in the Senate, it's supported by both progressives and conservatives, and it's called the First Step Act. It reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, gives judges more discretion, expands rehab programs, and bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also helps elderly and terminally ill inmates get released and invests in re-entry programs. The bill retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which could affect thousands of people. 

I should mention the support from public figures like Patricia Arquette and Mark Cuban, and that Trump supports it. Also, the fact that it's a significant bipartisan achievement and that it's expected to pass the House again. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the main effects of the bill and its significance.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12 with bipartisan support, aiming to reduce drug crime sentences and improve prisoner rehabilitation. The bill allows judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent offenders, bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, and provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home. It also retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. Supported by figures like Patricia Arquette and Mark Cuban, and backed by President Trump, the bill is expected to pass the House and be signed into law soon. It marks a significant bipartisan effort to address mass incarceration and promote rehabilitation, though critics note it only affects federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the U.S. prison population. END OF SUMMARY.
