Okay, so I need to help this user who wants a news summary with moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the First Step Act passing in the Senate, which is a criminal justice reform bill. It reduces drug sentences, gives judges more discretion, and focuses on prisoner rehabilitation.

The user has two main tasks. The first is to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "landmark," "support," "reform," "discretion," "rehabilitation," "unjust," "hope," "second chance," "saves," "unjustly," "unfair," "catastrophic," "healing," "crisis," "prevail," "common sense," and "step." These words are used to convey the moral aspects of the bill.

Next, I have to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the bipartisan support, the bill's provisions, and the positive impact on prisoners and communities. I'll make sure to include the key points: reducing sentences, expanding rehabilitation, banning inhumane practices, and the potential for thousands to be affected. I'll also mention the support from various groups and the president's backing, emphasizing the moral victory and the step towards reform.

I need to structure the summary clearly, starting with the passage of the bill, then detailing its provisions, followed by the reactions and support, and ending with the significance of the step taken. I'll ensure that the morally framed words are naturally integrated to preserve the author's original moral perspective.

**SUMMARY:**  
The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12, earning bipartisan support and praise from advocates and public figures. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, give judges more discretion, and improve rehabilitation programs for federal prisoners. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home. The act retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. Supporters, including President Trump, highlighted its potential to save billions, provide hope, and heal communities disproportionately impacted by mass incarceration. Advocacy groups like #cut50 and the ACLU welcomed the bill as a step toward addressing the crisis of mass incarceration, though they acknowledged its limitations. The legislation, while not perfect, marks a significant bipartisan victory in the fight for criminal justice reform.
