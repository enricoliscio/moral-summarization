SUMMARY: A bipartisan bill to reform the US criminal justice system, the First Step Act, has passed in the Senate and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump. The bill seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, give judges more discretion in sentencing, expand rehabilitation programs for prisoners, and ban certain inhumane correctional practices. It also provides a path for the release of elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The act has received support from both progressives and conservatives, as well as public figures like Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West. Advocates applaud the bill as a crucial step towards addressing the harms of mass incarceration, particularly for non-violent drug offenders. The ACLU, while acknowledging the bill's imperfections, supports it as a necessary step towards addressing the mass incarceration crisis. However, it's important to note that the bill only affects federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the country's prison population.
END OF SUMMARY.
