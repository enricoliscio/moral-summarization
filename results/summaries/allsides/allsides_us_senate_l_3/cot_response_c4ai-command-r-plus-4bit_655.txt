SUMMARY:
A landmark criminal justice reform bill has cleared the Senate, marking a legislative victory for both progressive advocates and law-and-order conservatives. The First Step Act addresses concerns about the nation's war on drugs, which has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequate preparation for their re-entry into society. The act seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, grant judges more discretion in sentencing, expand rehabilitation efforts, and ban inhumane correctional practices such as the shackling of pregnant women. It also ends "three strikes" mandatory life sentences and addresses sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses. The bill has garnered bipartisan support and is expected to pass in the House before being signed into law by President Trump, who has framed it as a step towards healing for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, offering a second chance to those who have made mistakes. The legislation has been hailed as a "historic" bipartisan victory by some, while others note that it is just the first step towards addressing the nation's mass incarceration crisis and unwinding the harm caused by the incarceration industry.
