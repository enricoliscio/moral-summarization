SUMMARY:
The First Step Act, a landmark bill, has cleared the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support, marking a historic victory for criminal justice reform. The bill addresses concerns that the nation's war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences, allow judges more discretion, and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It would also end "three strikes" mandatory life sentences and ban inhumane correctional practices. The bill is a step towards "healing" for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. While not "perfect", the act is a crucial step towards reform, and its passage is a "common sense" move to address the mass incarceration crisis. The bill is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Trump, who has expressed his support for the legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
