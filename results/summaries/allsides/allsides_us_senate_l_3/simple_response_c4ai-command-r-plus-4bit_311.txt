SUMMARY: A bipartisan bill seeking to reform the criminal justice system, the First Step Act, has cleared the US Senate, with support from public figures and President Trump. The bill addresses concerns about the nation's war on drugs, which has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent drug crimes without adequately preparing them for reintegration. The act reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, gives judges more discretion in sentencing, expands rehabilitation efforts, and bans inhumane correctional practices. It provides a path home for elderly and ill inmates and invests in re-entry programs. The bill also retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, addressing the disparity in sentencing for crack and powder cocaine offenses, which could lead to the release of thousands of drug offenders serving long sentences. The ACLU and criminal justice reform advocates applaud the bill as an important step toward addressing the harm caused by the incarceration industry, despite its imperfections. The bill represents a moral victory for those seeking to heal communities affected by mass incarceration and a more humane approach to criminal justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
