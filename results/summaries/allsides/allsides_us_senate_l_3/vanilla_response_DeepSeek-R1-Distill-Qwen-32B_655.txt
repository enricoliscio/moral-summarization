Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the First Step Act. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the First Step Act is a landmark bill that reduces drug crime sentences and has support from both progressives and law-and-order conservatives. It passed in the Senate 87-12, which is a significant majority. Notable figures like Patricia Arquette, Mark Cuban, Kim Kardashian West, and Kanye West supported it. Trump initially supported the House version and the current Senate version needs to go back to the House for another vote before he signs it.

The bill aims to address the issue that the war on drugs led to too many non-violent offenders being imprisoned without proper rehabilitation. It reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, gives judges more discretion, expands rehab opportunities, bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, and helps elderly or terminally ill inmates get released. It also ends the "three strikes" rule for drug offenses, unless there's a violent felony history, and retroactively extends the Fair Sentencing Act, potentially freeing up to 4,000 inmates.

Supporters include groups like #cut50 and the ACLU, though the latter noted it's not perfect but necessary. The bill only affects federal prisoners, who are less than 10% of the total prison population.

So, the summary should include the passage of the bill, its bipartisan support, key provisions like reduced sentences, judge discretion, rehab programs, ending shackling, helping elderly inmates, retroactive changes, and the impact on federal prisoners. Also, mention the support from various groups and figures, and the overall aim to reduce mass incarceration.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to highlight the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12, with support from progressives, law-and-order conservatives, and public figures like Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, give judges more discretion, expand rehabilitation programs, and ban inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home and retroactively extends the Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. The legislation, which now heads to the House for final approval, is seen as a step toward addressing mass incarceration, though it only applies to federal prisoners. END OF SUMMARY.
