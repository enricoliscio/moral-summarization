SUMMARY:
A landmark criminal justice reform bill, the First Step Act, has cleared the US Senate in a legislative victory that addresses concerns about the nation's war on drugs leading to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes. The bill reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, gives judges more discretion in sentencing, expands rehabilitation opportunities, and bans inhumane correctional practices. It attracted bipartisan support and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump later this week. The act is seen as a step toward unwinding the harm caused by the incarceration industry and addressing the mass incarceration crisis in the US. It will affect only federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the country's prison population. The bill is by no means perfect, but it represents a small step toward healing communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system.
END OF SUMMARY.
