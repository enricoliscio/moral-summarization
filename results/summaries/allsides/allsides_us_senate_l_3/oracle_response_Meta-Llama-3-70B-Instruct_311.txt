SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support, aiming to address concerns that the nation's war on drugs led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes. The bill would give judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders, allowing them to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders. It would also expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners, ban inhumane correctional practices, and provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates. The act would end "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for defendants facing a third drug conviction, except for those with a prior "serious violent felony". The bill represents a step towards "healing" for communities affected by the criminal justice system, which "feeds on certain communities and not on others". The ACLU notes that while the bill is "by no means perfect", it's a necessary step towards addressing the mass incarceration crisis.
