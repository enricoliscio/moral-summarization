SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a sweeping bill seeking to reform the criminal justice system, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. The act addresses concerns about the over-incarceration of non-violent drug offenders and seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes while giving judges more discretion in sentencing. It also aims to improve rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners and ban inhumane correctional practices, such as the shackling of pregnant women. The act will give a second chance to those who earn it, while also saving billions of dollars. Public figures and politicians from both sides of the aisle have praised the bill, with some calling it a historic step towards unwinding the harm of the incarceration industry and healing communities affected by mass incarceration. The act will now return to the House for another vote before being signed into law by President Trump, who has expressed his support. This landmark legislation is a crucial step towards addressing the nation's flawed criminal justice system and the harm it has caused to certain communities.
END OF SUMMARY.
