SUMMARY: A bipartisan bill that seeks to reform the criminal justice system has passed in the Senate with a vote of 87-12. The First Step Act addresses concerns about the over-imprisonment of Americans for non-violent drug-related crimes and seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for these offenses. The act gives judges more discretion in sentencing, expands rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners, and bans inhumane correctional practices such as the shackling of pregnant women. It also provides a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The act ends mandatory life sentences for three-time drug offenders, except in cases of a prior "serious violent felony". The bill has attracted support from both sides of the political aisle, as well as public figures and President Trump, who has expressed his intention to sign it into law. The act is expected to affect thousands of federal prisoners, offering them a second chance and providing hope for healing in communities disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.

END OF SUMMARY.
