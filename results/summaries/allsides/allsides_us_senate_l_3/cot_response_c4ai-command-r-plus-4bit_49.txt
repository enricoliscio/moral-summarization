SUMMARY: 
A landmark bill to reform the criminal justice system has cleared the US Senate, marking a victory for advocates of criminal justice reform. The First Step Act addresses concerns that the nation's war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent drug crimes, without adequately preparing them for their return to society. The bill seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and give judges more discretion in sentencing, with a focus on boosting rehabilitation efforts and providing a second chance for those who earn it. It also bans inhumane correctional practices, such as the shackling of pregnant women. By reducing sentences for non-violent offenders and investing in re-entry programming, the act aims to heal communities that have been disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. While the bill is not perfect, advocates applaud the bipartisan effort to address the harm caused by mass incarceration, which has been recognized as a crisis in the US. The First Step Act will now return to the House for another vote before being signed into law by President Trump, who has expressed support for the bill. END OF SUMMARY.
