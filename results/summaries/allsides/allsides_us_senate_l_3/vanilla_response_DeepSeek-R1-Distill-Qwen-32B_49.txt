Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the First Step Act. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The article mentions that the bill passed in the Senate with bipartisan support, which is a big deal. It's a criminal justice reform bill, so it's about reducing sentences for drug crimes and improving prisoner rehabilitation.

I should note the main provisions of the bill: reducing mandatory minimum sentences, allowing judges more discretion, expanding rehab programs, banning inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, and providing pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates. Also, it ends the "three strikes" rule for drug offenses and retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act, which could affect thousands of prisoners.

The article also mentions support from various public figures and the president, Trump, who is backing the bill. There are quotes from senators like Cory Booker and Chuck Grassley, emphasizing the bipartisan nature and the impact on communities. The ACLU's stance is noted, though they initially opposed the House version but now support the Senate's move.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I should highlight the bipartisan passage, the key reforms, the impact on federal prisoners, and the support from different groups. I'll make sure to mention the potential for thousands of people to be affected by the retroactive changes and the overall goal of criminal justice reform.

Let me structure the summary: start with the passage in the Senate, mention the bipartisan support, outline the main reforms, include Trump's support and quotes, note the impact on prisoners, and conclude with the significance of the bill as a step towards reform. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12, with support from progressives, law-and-order conservatives, and public figures like Patricia Arquette and Kim Kardashian West. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, give judges more discretion, expand prisoner rehabilitation programs, and ban inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home and ends "three strikes" life sentences for non-violent drug offenders. The bill retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. President Trump expressed support, calling it a "historic" step toward safer communities and saving billions. Advocates like Cory Booker praised the bill as a step toward healing communities disproportionately affected by mass incarceration. While the ACLU noted the bill isn't perfect, it applauds the Senate's progress. The act applies only to federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the U.S. prison population. END OF SUMMARY.
