SUMMARY: A bipartisan effort to pass the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill, has been hailed as a legislative victory for both progressive advocates and law-and-order conservatives. The bill addresses concerns about the nation's war on drugs, which has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes, and seeks to prepare them for their reintegration into society. The act reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, expands prisoner rehabilitation efforts, and bans inhumane correctional practices. It also provides a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates, invests in re-entry programming, and ends "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for drug convictions, except for those with prior violent felonies. The bill represents a step towards healing for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump later this week. This bill is a moral victory, as it seeks to right the wrongs of a system that has disproportionately affected certain communities and seeks to provide a second chance for those who have made mistakes.
END OF SUMMARY.
