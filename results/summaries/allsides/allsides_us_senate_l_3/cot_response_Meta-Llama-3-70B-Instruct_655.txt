SUMMARY:
The landmark First Step Act, a historic criminal justice reform bill, has cleared the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. This big victory addresses concerns that the nation's war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences, allow judges more discretion, and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it. It would also end inhumane correctional practices, invest in re-entry programming, and give elderly and terminally ill inmates a path home. While the ACLU notes that the bill is "by no means perfect", it's a crucial step towards healing for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. The bill would affect thousands of lives and is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
