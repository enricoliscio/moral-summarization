Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the First Step Act. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about the First Step Act passing in the Senate with bipartisan support. It mentions that both progressives and law-and-order conservatives supported it. The bill aims to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion, and improve prisoner rehabilitation. It also addresses the issue of mass incarceration, particularly how the war on drugs led to too many non-violent offenders being imprisoned without proper reintegration support.

The moral framing here seems to focus on justice, fairness, and compassion. The author highlights how the bill provides hope and a second chance, especially for those who have made mistakes. There's a mention of saving billions of dollars, which is an economic argument, but the moral aspect is more about reducing the harshness of sentences and helping people reintegrate into society.

I also notice that the article quotes Trump, emphasizing that this bill helps all citizens, including those who have made mistakes, and makes communities safer. This ties into the moral idea of rehabilitation over punishment. The ACLU's statement that the bill isn't perfect but is a step in the right direction during a crisis also adds to the moral push for reform.

So, in the summary, I need to capture the bipartisan support, the main provisions of the bill (reducing sentences, judges' discretion, rehabilitation, banning inhumane practices), and the moral arguments about fairness, second chances, and addressing the negative impacts of the incarceration industry. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral perspective highlighted in the original text.

I should start by stating the bill's passage, mention the support from both sides, outline the key reforms, and then touch on the moral implications like justice, rehabilitation, and the impact on communities. I need to make sure not to include too much detail but focus on the essence of the moral framing.

Let me structure it: introduce the bill, its passage, the support, the main provisions, the moral arguments from the president and others, and the overall impact on society. That should cover the necessary points while preserving the moral angle.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12 with bipartisan support, reflecting a rare consensus between progressives and law-and-order conservatives. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, give judges more discretion in sentencing, and improve prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home. The legislation addresses the over-incarceration of non-violent offenders due to the war on drugs and seeks to save billions by reducing recidivism. President Trump praised the bill as a step toward healing and providing second chances, while advocates like Cory Booker highlighted its potential to help marginalized communities disproportionately affected by mass incarceration. Though not perfect, the bill marks a significant move toward addressing the moral failings of the criminal justice system. END OF SUMMARY.
