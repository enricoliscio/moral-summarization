SUMMARY: A bipartisan effort has led to the passage of the First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill that addresses concerns about the over-incarceration of non-violent drug offenders and seeks to provide them with a second chance. The act, which has been hailed as a historic step towards unwinding the harm of the incarceration industry, reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, expands rehabilitation opportunities, and bans inhumane correctional practices. It also provides a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The bill attracted support from a wide range of public figures and advocates, who recognized the importance of offering hope and a chance at rehabilitation to those who have made mistakes. This legislation is a significant step towards addressing the nation's broken criminal justice system, which disproportionately affects those struggling with mental illness, addiction, and poverty, and it offers a glimmer of healing to communities that have been harmed by over-incarceration. While the bill is not perfect and only affects federal prisoners, it represents a meaningful step towards much-needed reform and a more humane approach to criminal justice. END OF SUMMARY.
