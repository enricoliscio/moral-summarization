SUMMARY: A sweeping bill to reform the criminal justice system has passed in the Senate with bipartisan support. The First Step Act addresses concerns about the over-imprisonment of Americans for non-violent drug crimes and seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related offenses, giving judges more discretion in sentencing. The act also bans inhumane correctional practices such as the shackling of pregnant women, and expands rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. It will give a path home to elderly and terminally ill inmates and invest in re-entry programming. The bill will also retroactively extend the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of drug offenders serving long sentences for crack cocaine. Public figures and politicians from both sides of the aisle have applauded the bill, with President Trump calling it a "historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill" that will "keep our communities safer" and provide a "second chance" for those who earn it. The act is a first step towards unwinding the harm of the incarceration industry and healing communities affected by mass incarceration.
END OF SUMMARY.
