Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The article is about the First Step Act passing in the Senate, supported by both parties. It reduces sentences for drug crimes, gives judges more discretion, and focuses on rehabilitation. I should highlight the bipartisan support, the reduction in mandatory sentences, the humane practices like ending shackling, and the benefits for prisoners. Also, mention the president's support and the positive impact on communities. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points and use the moral terms provided.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed in the Senate with bipartisan support, aiming to reduce drug-related crime sentences and enhance prisoner rehabilitation. The bill grants judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent offenders, ends inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, and provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home. It also retroactively extends the Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. Advocates, including public figures and reform groups, praised the legislation as a step toward healing and reducing mass incarceration. President Trump highlighted the bill’s potential to save billions, keep communities safer, and offer second chances. While not perfect, the act represents a significant bipartisan effort to address the nation’s criminal justice crisis, focusing on rehabilitation, fairness, and reducing the harm caused by the incarceration system. END OF SUMMARY.
