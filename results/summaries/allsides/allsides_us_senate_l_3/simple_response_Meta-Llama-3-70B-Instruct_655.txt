SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill aims to address the nation's war on drugs, which has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequate preparation for their return to society. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences, and expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. It would also ban inhumane correctional practices, provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates, and invest in re-entry programming. The bill has been hailed as a "big bipartisan victory" and a step towards "healing" for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. While not perfect, the bill is a crucial step towards addressing the mass incarceration crisis and providing hope and a second chance to those who have made mistakes.
