SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has cleared the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. This historic legislation addresses concerns that the war on drugs led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. The bill would give judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders, allowing them to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders. It would also expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners, ban inhumane correctional practices, and provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates. The act would end "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for defendants facing a third drug conviction, except for those with a prior "serious violent felony". The bill represents a crucial step towards reform, healing, and providing hope and a second chance to those who earn it.
