Alright, I need to summarize this article about the First Step Act. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about a bill called the First Step Act that passed in the Senate with bipartisan support. It's about criminal justice reform, reducing drug sentences, and improving prisoner rehabilitation. Both progressives and conservatives supported it, which is interesting.

The bill reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, gives judges more discretion, and expands rehab programs. It also bans some harsh practices like shackling pregnant women. Plus, it helps elderly and terminally ill inmates get home and invests in re-entry programs. It ends the "three strikes" rule for drug offenses unless there's a violent felony involved. It retroactively applies the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which could help thousands of people.

Supporters include celebrities like Patricia Arquette and Mark Cuban, and Trump is on board too. Advocacy groups are happy, but some think it's not perfect. It only affects federal prisoners, who are a small part of the total.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the bipartisan support, key provisions like reduced sentences, judge discretion, rehab, ending shackling, re-entry programs, and the retroactive application. Also note it's for federal prisoners only and the mixed but mostly positive reactions.

It bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home, and ends "three strikes" life sentences for non-violent drug offenders. The bill retroactively applies the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially benefiting thousands. Supporters include celebrities and President Trump, who praised it as a step toward safer communities and cost savings. Advocacy groups, while acknowledging its imperfections, welcomed the progress. The act focuses on federal prisoners, representing a significant but limited step in addressing mass incarceration. END OF SUMMARY.
