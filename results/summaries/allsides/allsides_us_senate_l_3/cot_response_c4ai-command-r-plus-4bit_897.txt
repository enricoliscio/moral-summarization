SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark bill that addresses concerns about the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent drug crimes, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. The act seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, give judges more discretion in sentencing, and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It also bans inhumane correctional practices and provides a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates. The bill is a victory for both progressive advocates and law-and-order conservatives, who have come together to address the harm caused by the nation's war on drugs and the incarceration industry. The act is a step towards healing for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system and addresses the mass incarceration crisis in the United States. While the legislation only affects federal prisoners, who make up a small percentage of the total prison population, it is a significant bipartisan step towards criminal justice reform.
