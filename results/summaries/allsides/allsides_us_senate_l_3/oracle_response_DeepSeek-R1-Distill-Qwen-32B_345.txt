Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified to keep as many of the morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the First Step Act passing in the Senate. It's a bipartisan effort supported by both progressives and conservatives. The bill aims to reduce drug-related sentences, give judges more discretion, improve rehabilitation, and end inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also helps prisoners re-enter society and affects federal prisoners.

I notice the author uses words like "discretion," "sentencing," "imprisonment," "crimes," "fight," "mistakes," "passing," "safer," "signing," "drug-related," "circumvent," "rehabilitative," "ban," "inhumane," "shackling," "home," "invest," "end," "conviction," "felony," "firearm," "crime," "leading," "consensus," "unwinding," "reform," "healing."

I need to include as many of these words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the essence of the bill's impact and the moral aspects highlighted.

I'll start by mentioning the passage of the First Step Act in the Senate, the bipartisan support, and the key provisions. Then, I'll note the moral implications, such as reducing imprisonment, ending inhumane practices, and investing in rehabilitation. I'll also include quotes from Trump and Booker to emphasize the moral framing. Finally, I'll mention the ACLU's stance, showing that while the act isn't perfect, it's a step towards reform.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the important points without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence contributes to the moral narrative.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed in the Senate with bipartisan support, aiming to reduce drug-related sentences and improve rehabilitation efforts. The bill grants judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent offenders, ends inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, and invests in re-entry programs to help prisoners return to society. It also retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of inmates. President Trump praised the bill as a step toward healing and saving billions, while Senator Cory Booker highlighted its role in addressing systemic inequities in the criminal justice system. Advocacy groups like #cut50 and the ACLU welcomed the legislation, though some noted it was imperfect. The bill, which affects federal prisoners, marks a significant bipartisan effort to unwind the harm caused by mass incarceration. END OF SUMMARY.
