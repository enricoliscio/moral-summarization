Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about the First Step Act passing in the Senate. It's a bipartisan effort supported by both progressives and conservatives. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, give judges more discretion, improve prisoner rehabilitation, and end some inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also helps elderly and terminally ill inmates return home and invests in re-entry programs.

I should identify the morally charged words from the author's list: discretion, sentencing, addresses, imprisonment, crimes, fight, mistakes, passing, safer, signing, drug-related, circumvent, rehabilitative, ban, inhumane, shackling, home, invest, end, conviction, felony, firearm, crime, leading, consensus, unwinding, reform, healing.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes as many of these words as possible. I'll structure it to highlight the bipartisan support, the bill's goals, and the moral implications, like reducing imprisonment and promoting rehabilitation.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the passage in the Senate, mention bipartisan support, then outline the bill's main provisions: reducing sentences, discretion for judges, ending inhumane practices, helping inmates return home, investing in re-entry, and ending three-strikes for drug offenses. Include the impact on thousands of lives and the consensus among lawmakers. End with the moral aspects like healing and unwinding the incarceration crisis.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral terms without making it sound forced. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The First Step Act, a landmark bipartisan bill, passed the Senate 87-12, aiming to reform the criminal justice system by reducing drug-related sentencing and improving prisoner rehabilitation. The bill gives judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent offenders, bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, and invests in re-entry programs to help inmates return home. It ends "three strikes" life sentences for drug offenses and retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. The legislation, supported by progressives and law-and-order conservatives, addresses the over-imprisonment of non-violent offenders and seeks to heal communities disproportionately impacted by the criminal justice system. President Trump praised the bill as a step toward "hope and a second chance," while advocates like Cory Booker highlighted its role in unwinding the incarceration crisis. The act, though not perfect, marks a significant bipartisan effort to reduce imprisonment and promote rehabilitation. END OF SUMMARY.
