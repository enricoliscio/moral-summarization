SUMMARY:
The First Step Act, a landmark and historic bill, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support, marking a significant step towards criminal justice reform. The bill addresses concerns that the nation's war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders, and expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. It would also ban inhumane correctional practices and provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates. The bill represents a step towards healing for communities disproportionately affected by the incarceration industry. While not perfect, the act is a common sense approach to addressing the mass incarceration crisis. It is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Trump.
