SUMMARY:
The First Step Act, a landmark bill, has cleared the Senate with a historic 87-12 vote, marking a bipartisan victory in criminal justice reform. The bill addresses concerns that the nation's war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It would also provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invest in re-entry programming. The bill represents a step toward "healing" for communities affected by the incarceration industry. While not "perfect", the act is a crucial step in addressing the nation's mass incarceration crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
