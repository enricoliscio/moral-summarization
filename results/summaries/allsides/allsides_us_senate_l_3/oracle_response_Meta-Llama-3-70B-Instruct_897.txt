SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support, aiming to address the nation's war on drugs that led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes. The bill would give judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders, allowing them to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders. It would also expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners, ban inhumane correctional practices such as the shackling of pregnant women, and provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates. The act would end so-called "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for defendants facing a third drug conviction, except for those with a prior "serious violent felony". The bill represents a step towards healing for communities affected by the incarceration industry, and its passing is a big bipartisan victory. END OF SUMMARY.
