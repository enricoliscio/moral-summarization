SUMMARY:

The US Senate has passed the First Step Act, a landmark bill aimed at reforming the criminal justice system, with an overwhelming 87-12 vote. The bill, which has received bipartisan support, seeks to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion in sentencing, and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It addresses concerns that the war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequate preparation for their return to society. The bill would reduce mandatory minimum sentences, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It would also provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invest in re-entry programming. The bill has received support from public figures such as Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West, and is expected to pass in the House before reaching President Trump's desk for signature.
