SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill aims to address concerns that the war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, give judges more discretion, and expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. It would also ban inhumane correctional practices, provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates, and invest in re-entry programming. The bill represents a crucial step towards healing and redemption for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. As President Trump tweeted, "This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it." The bill's passage is a moral victory, recognizing that America's incarceration industry has caused catastrophic harm and that it's time to take the first step towards reform.
