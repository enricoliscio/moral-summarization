SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has passed in the Senate with strong bipartisan support. The bill seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, give judges more discretion in sentencing, expand rehabilitation efforts for prisoners, and ban certain inhumane correctional practices. It is expected to pass in the House and be signed into law by President Trump, who has expressed support for the bill. The act addresses concerns about the over-incarceration of non-violent drug offenders and aims to provide better preparation for their re-entry into society. The bill has been praised by advocates and public figures alike, with some calling it a "historic" victory for criminal justice reform. It will affect only federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the country's prison population. The act is seen as a significant step towards addressing the nation's mass incarceration crisis and its disproportionate impact on certain communities.
