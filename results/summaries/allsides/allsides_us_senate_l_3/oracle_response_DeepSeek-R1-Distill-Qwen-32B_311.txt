Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the First Step Act passing in the Senate, which is a criminal justice reform bill. It has bipartisan support, including from notable figures and the president. The bill aims to reduce drug-related sentences, give judges more discretion, improve rehabilitation, and end some inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also affects federal prisoners, which is a smaller portion of the overall prison population.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They include discretion, sentencing, addresses, imprisonment, crimes, fight, mistakes, passing, safer, signing, drug-related, circumvent, rehabilitative, ban, inhumane, shackling, home, invest, end, conviction, felony, firearm, crime, leading, consensus, unwinding, reform, healing.

I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should highlight the key aspects of the bill, the bipartisan support, and the moral implications.

I'll start by mentioning the passage of the First Step Act in the Senate with bipartisan support. Then, I'll outline what the bill does: reduces drug-related sentences, gives judges discretion, expands rehabilitation, bans inhumane practices, and ends mandatory life sentences. I'll also note that it affects federal prisoners and the positive impact on communities and costs. Finally, I'll include quotes from Trump and Booker to emphasize the moral aspects of giving a second chance and addressing mass incarceration.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12 with bipartisan support, reflecting a rare consensus between progressives and law-and-order conservatives. The bill aims to reduce drug-related sentencing, grant judges discretion in non-violent cases, and improve prisoner rehabilitation. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and ends "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for non-violent offenders. The legislation retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially freeing thousands serving disproportionately long sentences. President Trump praised the bill as a step toward healing and saving billions, while advocates like Cory Booker highlighted its role in addressing mass incarceration and mental health issues in prisons. Though imperfect, the bill represents a significant move toward criminal justice reform, affecting federal prisoners and fostering safer communities. END OF SUMMARY.
