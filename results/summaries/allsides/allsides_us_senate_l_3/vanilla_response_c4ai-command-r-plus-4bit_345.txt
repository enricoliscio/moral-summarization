SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark bill seeking to reform the US criminal justice system, has passed in the Senate with bipartisan support. The bill addresses concerns about the nation's war on drugs, which has led to the imprisonment of many Americans for non-violent drug offenses without adequate preparation for their re-entry into society. The act reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, gives judges more discretion in sentencing, expands rehabilitation programs for prisoners, and bans inhumane correctional practices. It also provides a path for the release of elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The act ends mandatory life sentences for three-time drug offenders and firearm possession regulations during a crime. It could affect up to 4,000 people serving long sentences for crack cocaine offenses. Public figures and advocates have applauded the bill as a significant step toward addressing mass incarceration and its disproportionate impact on certain communities. While the bill only affects federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the country's prison population, it is seen as a significant step toward criminal justice reform.
