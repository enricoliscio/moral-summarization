Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the First Step Act. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. Hmm, the article talks about a bill that's supported by both progressives and conservatives. It's a criminal justice reform that reduces drug sentences and focuses on rehabilitation. 

I should start by identifying the key points. The bill passed the Senate 87-12, which shows bipartisan support. It reduces mandatory minimums for drug offenses, gives judges more discretion, and includes measures for prisoner rehabilitation. It also ends some harsh policies like shackling pregnant women and the three-strikes rule for non-violent offenders. 

The moral angle here is about fairness and second chances. The author emphasizes how this bill addresses the over-incarceration of non-violent offenders, especially from marginalized communities. There's also mention of cost savings and the human side, like people not becoming statistics after prison. 

I need to make sure the summary reflects these moral aspects without getting bogged down in too many details. Maybe mention the bipartisan support, the key reforms, and the positive impact on communities and individuals. Also, include Trump's supportive tweet to highlight the administration's stance on reform. 

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the bill passing, mention the support, outline the main provisions, and conclude with the moral implications and potential for change. Make sure to include that it affects federal prisoners but note it's a step towards broader reform. 

Wait, I also need to include the voices like Cory Booker and the ACLU, which add to the moral framing by talking about systemic issues and the need for reform. That will show the broader impact beyond just the legislation itself. 

Okay, putting it all together: a brief overview of the bill, its provisions, the support it received, and the moral reasoning behind it. Make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit. I think that covers the main points and preserves the author's moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12, garnering bipartisan support and backing from public figures like Patricia Arquette and Mark Cuban. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, give judges more discretion, and improve rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and ends "three strikes" life sentences for non-violent offenders. The legislation could affect thousands of inmates, including those disproportionately sentenced for crack cocaine offenses. President Trump praised the bill as a step toward "hope and a second chance," while advocates like Cory Booker highlighted its potential to address systemic inequities in the criminal justice system. Though the bill only affects federal prisoners, it marks a significant bipartisan effort to reduce mass incarceration and promote rehabilitation. END OF SUMMARY.
