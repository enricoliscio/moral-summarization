SUMMARY:

The US Senate has passed the First Step Act, a landmark bill aimed at reforming the criminal justice system, with an overwhelming 87-12 vote. The bill, which has garnered support from both progressives and law-and-order conservatives, seeks to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion in sentencing, and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. The bill would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug-related crimes, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It would also provide a path to release for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invest in re-entry programming. The bill is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Trump, who has expressed his support for the legislation. The ACLU has also endorsed the bill, despite its imperfections, citing the need to address the mass incarceration crisis.
