Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the First Step Act passing in the Senate. It's a bipartisan effort supported by both progressives and conservatives. The bill aims to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion, and improve prisoner rehabilitation. It also addresses the issue of mass incarceration, particularly from the war on drugs.

I should highlight the key points: the bill's passage, the bipartisan support, the specific reforms like reducing mandatory sentences, expanding rehabilitation, and banning inhumane practices. Also, mention the impact on federal prisoners and the potential for thousands to be affected.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the moral aspects, like providing second chances and addressing the over-incarceration of non-violent offenders. I'll make sure to mention the support from various groups and the positive impact on communities.

Let me structure the summary to start with the bill's passage, then the reforms, followed by the bipartisan support, and end with the positive outcomes and the need for further action.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, passed in the Senate 87-12, reflecting support from progressives and law-and-order conservatives. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, expand rehabilitation programs for federal prisoners, and ban inhumane correctional practices like shackling pregnant women. It also provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home and retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. The legislation, which now awaits final passage in the House, is seen as a step toward addressing mass incarceration and the disproportionate impact of the war on drugs on marginalized communities. Supporters, including President Trump, highlight its potential to save billions, improve public safety, and offer second chances. Advocates like Cory Booker and criminal justice reform groups applaud the bill as a crucial, though imperfect, first step toward healing and reducing the nation's incarceration crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
