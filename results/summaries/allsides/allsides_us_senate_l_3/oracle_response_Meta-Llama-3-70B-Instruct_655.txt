SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark bill, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support, aiming to reform the criminal justice system. The bill addresses concerns that the war on drugs led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. It would give judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders, allow them to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders, and expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. The act would also ban inhumane correctional practices, such as the shackling of pregnant women, and provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates. Additionally, it would end "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for defendants facing a third drug conviction, except for those with a prior "serious violent felony". The bill represents a step towards healing for communities affected by the incarceration industry, and its passing is a big bipartisan victory. END OF SUMMARY.
