SUMMARY: A landmark criminal justice reform bill, the First Step Act, has cleared the Senate with strong bipartisan support. The act seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, give judges more discretion in sentencing, expand rehabilitation programs for prisoners, and ban certain inhumane correctional practices. It also provides a path for the release of elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The bill addresses concerns about the over-incarceration of non-violent drug offenders and seeks to prepare them for their return to society. Public figures and advocates have applauded the bill as a significant step towards unwinding the harm of the incarceration industry, with the potential to affect thousands of lives. The First Step Act will now return to the House for another vote before reaching President Trump's desk for signature later this week.
