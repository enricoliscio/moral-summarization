SUMMARY:
The landmark First Step Act, a historic criminal justice reform bill, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. The bill addresses the catastrophic harm of the incarceration industry, seeking to reduce drug crime sentences and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it. The act would give judges more discretion, boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It would also provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invest in re-entry programming. The bill represents a step toward healing for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. While not perfect, the First Step Act is a crucial step towards reform, and its passage is a big bipartisan victory. The bill is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Trump later this week.
END OF SUMMARY.
