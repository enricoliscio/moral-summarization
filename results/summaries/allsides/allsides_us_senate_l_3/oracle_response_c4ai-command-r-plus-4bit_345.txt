SUMMARY: A bipartisan victory for criminal justice reform, the First Step Act has cleared the Senate with an overwhelming majority. The bill addresses concerns about the nation's war on drugs and its impact on mass incarceration, giving judges more discretion in sentencing for drug-related crimes and boosting rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners. It reduces mandatory minimum sentences, allows judges to circumvent mandatory minimums for non-violent offenders, bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women, and ends "three strikes" mandatory life sentences. The act also provides a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. Public figures and advocates alike have applauded the bill, which will now return to the House for another vote before reaching the president's desk for signing into law. This landmark legislation is a step towards healing for communities affected by a criminal justice system that feeds on certain groups, and it is expected to affect thousands of lives for the better.
END OF SUMMARY.
