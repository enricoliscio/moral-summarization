SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill aims to address the nation's war on drugs, which has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequate preparation for their return to society. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, give judges more discretion, and expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. It would also ban inhumane correctional practices, provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates, and invest in re-entry programming. The bill represents a step towards "healing" for communities disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system. While not perfect, the act is a crucial step towards addressing the mass incarceration crisis. With the president's expected signature, the bill would bring hope and a second chance to thousands of Americans.
