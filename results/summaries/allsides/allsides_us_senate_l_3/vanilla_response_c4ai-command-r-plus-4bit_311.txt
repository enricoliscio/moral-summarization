SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed in the US Senate with bipartisan support. The bill seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, give judges more discretion in sentencing, expand prisoner rehabilitation efforts, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It also provides a path for the release of elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The act ends "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for drug convictions, except for those with prior serious violent felonies, and eliminates "stacking" regulations regarding firearm possession during a crime. The bill will now return to the House for another vote before reaching President Trump's desk for signature. Supporters of the act include public figures and advocates for criminal justice reform, who applaud the bipartisan effort to address the harmful effects of mass incarceration. Critics, however, argue that the bill falls short of addressing the full scope of the mass incarceration crisis. The First Step Act only affects federal prisoners, who make up less than 10% of the country's prison population.
END OF SUMMARY.
