SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark bill, has cleared the Senate with bipartisan support, aiming to reform the criminal justice system. The bill addresses concerns that the war on drugs led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequately preparing them for their return to society. It gives judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders, boosts prisoner rehabilitation efforts, and bans inhumane correctional practices like shackling pregnant women. The act reduces mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes, allows judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders, and provides a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates. It also ends "three strikes" mandatory life sentences for defendants facing a third drug conviction, except for those with a prior "serious violent felony". The bill is a step towards healing for communities affected by the incarceration industry, and its passing is a big bipartisan victory. END OF SUMMARY.
