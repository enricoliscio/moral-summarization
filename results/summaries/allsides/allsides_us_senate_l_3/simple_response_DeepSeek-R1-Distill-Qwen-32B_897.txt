Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about the First Step Act while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the First Step Act passing in the Senate with bipartisan support, including from notable figures and President Trump. It aims to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion, improve prisoner rehabilitation, and end certain harsh practices like shackling pregnant women. It also mentions retroactive extensions and the impact on federal prisoners.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, such as providing second chances, reducing mass incarceration, and addressing the negative effects of the war on drugs. Also, the bipartisan support and the collaboration between different groups are important for the moral framing.

I should structure the summary to include the key elements: the bill's passage, its provisions, the support from various groups, the moral implications, and the potential impact on prisoners and communities. I'll make sure to mention the bipartisan nature and the positive outcomes expected from the bill.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit. I'll ensure it flows well and covers all the essential points while emphasizing the moral aspects.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12 with bipartisan support, reflecting a rare consensus between progressives and law-and-order conservatives. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, give judges more discretion, and improve prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It also bans inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women and provides pathways for elderly and terminally ill inmates to return home. The legislation retroactively extends the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially affecting thousands of prisoners. Advocates, including criminal justice reform groups and public figures like Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West, praised the bill as a step toward addressing the nation's mass incarceration crisis and providing second chances. President Trump highlighted the bill's potential to save billions and keep communities safer. While the ACLU noted the bill isn't perfect, it welcomed the progress. The act, which now awaits final passage in the House, represents a significant moral and legislative victory in the fight for criminal justice reform. END OF SUMMARY.
