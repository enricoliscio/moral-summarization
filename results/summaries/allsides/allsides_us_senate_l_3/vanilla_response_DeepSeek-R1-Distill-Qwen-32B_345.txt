Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the First Step Act. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a bill that's been passed by the Senate, supported by both progressives and conservatives. It aims to reform the criminal justice system, particularly focusing on reducing sentences for drug offenses and improving prisoner rehabilitation. 

I should note the key points: the bill passed 87-12, it's a bipartisan effort, and it's supported by notable figures like Trump and celebrities. The main changes include reducing mandatory minimum sentences, giving judges more discretion, expanding rehab programs, and banning inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also addresses the "three strikes" rule and retroactively applies the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially freeing thousands. 

I need to mention that it only affects federal prisoners, who are a small percentage of the total. Also, some groups like the ACLU have reservations but still support it. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to highlight the bipartisan success, the main reforms, and the impact on prisoners and society. Make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, passed the Senate 87-12, with support from progressives, law-and-order conservatives, and public figures like Donald Trump. The bill aims to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, give judges more discretion, expand prisoner rehabilitation, and ban inhumane practices like shackling pregnant women. It also ends "three strikes" life sentences for non-violent offenders and retroactively applies the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, potentially freeing thousands. While it only affects federal prisoners (less than 10% of the U.S. prison population), advocates see it as a significant step toward addressing mass incarceration and systemic inequities. END OF SUMMARY.
