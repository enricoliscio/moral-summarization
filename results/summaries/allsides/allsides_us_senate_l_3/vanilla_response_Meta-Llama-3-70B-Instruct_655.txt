SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has passed the Senate with bipartisan support, 87-12. The bill aims to reduce drug crime sentences, give judges more discretion, and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It addresses concerns that the war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes. The act would reduce mandatory minimum sentences, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences, and expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. It would also ban inhumane correctional practices, provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates, and invest in re-entry programming. The bill has received support from both progressives and law-and-order conservatives, as well as from public figures such as Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West. President Trump has also expressed his support for the bill, which is expected to pass the House and reach his desk for signature.
