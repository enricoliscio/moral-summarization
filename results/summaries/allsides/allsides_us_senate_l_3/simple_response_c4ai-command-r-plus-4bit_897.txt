SUMMARY: A sweeping criminal justice reform bill, the First Step Act, has passed in the Senate with bipartisan support. The bill addresses concerns about the over-incarceration of non-violent drug offenders and seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, give judges more discretion in sentencing, expand rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners, and ban inhumane correctional practices. It also provides a path for the release of elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The act is a significant step towards unwinding the harmful effects of the incarceration industry and addressing the nation's failed war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted certain communities. The bill has been applauded by criminal justice reform advocates as a bipartisan effort to address a critical issue facing the country. While it only affects federal prisoners, who make up a small percentage of the total prison population, it is seen as a positive step towards healing communities harmed by the criminal justice system.
END OF SUMMARY.
