SUMMARY:

The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill, has passed the Senate with bipartisan support. The bill aims to address concerns that the war on drugs has led to the imprisonment of too many Americans for non-violent crimes without adequate preparation for their return to society. It would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug-related crimes, allow judges to circumvent federal mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent offenders, and expand rehabilitative opportunities for federal prisoners. The act would also ban inhumane correctional practices, provide a path home for elderly and terminally ill inmates, and invest in re-entry programming. Advocates and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have hailed the bill as a crucial step towards healing and reforming the criminal justice system, which has disproportionately affected poor communities and those struggling with mental illness and addiction. The bill is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Trump.
