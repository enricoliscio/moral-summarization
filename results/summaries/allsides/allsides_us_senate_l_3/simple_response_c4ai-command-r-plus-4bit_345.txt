SUMMARY: A bipartisan effort to reform the criminal justice system has resulted in the First Step Act, which passed the Senate with overwhelming support. The act seeks to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes and give judges more discretion in sentencing, recognizing that the war on drugs has led to the over-incarceration of non-violent offenders. The act also expands rehabilitation opportunities for federal prisoners and bans inhumane correctional practices. It provides a path for the release of elderly and terminally ill inmates and invests in re-entry programming. The bill addresses the harm caused by the incarceration industry and seeks to heal communities disproportionately affected by mass incarceration. While only impacting federal prisoners, the First Step Act represents a significant step towards much-needed criminal justice reform, offering hope and a second chance to those who have made mistakes. The bipartisan support for the bill, including from public figures and President Trump, demonstrates a growing consensus that the nation's approach to criminal justice needs to change. END OF SUMMARY.
