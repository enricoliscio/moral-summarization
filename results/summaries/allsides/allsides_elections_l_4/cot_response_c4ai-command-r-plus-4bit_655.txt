SUMMARY: Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, the signature issue of his campaign, in what has been interpreted as an attempt to court the non-white vote. In doing so, he has been accused of lying and flip-flopping on his previous promises to build a wall and deport undocumented migrants. This week, Trump also lied about the safety of inner cities, claiming that war zones are safer than America's inner cities run by Democrats. He offered a misleading and offensive portrait of crime-ridden streets, contradicting decades of declining crime trends. In an attempt to gain support from African Americans, Trump lied about black unemployment rates, claiming that 58% of black youth are unemployed. This statistic was manipulated and is misleading. Trump's campaign is trailing Hillary Clinton's, and he is desperately trying to gain support from non-white voters. His softening on immigration and outreach to African Americans are attempts to gain support, but his offensive language and lies may do more harm than good. END OF SUMMARY.
