SUMMARY: In an attempt to court the non-white vote, Republican nominee Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, and tried to address African American unemployment. He claimed that he would ensure immigrants without legal status paid back taxes but did not commit to deportation, contradicting previous statements. Trump also made misleading statements about the safety of inner cities, claiming war zones were safer than American cities run by Democrats and that crime was at record levels. He further asserted that African American communities were suffering from Democratic control, citing a misleading unemployment statistic of 58% for young black Americans. This figure was disputed by economists and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which put the figure at 25.7% for 16- to 19-year-olds. Trump's efforts to appeal to non-white voters have faced challenges, with polls showing him trailing Hillary Clinton significantly among non-white voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
