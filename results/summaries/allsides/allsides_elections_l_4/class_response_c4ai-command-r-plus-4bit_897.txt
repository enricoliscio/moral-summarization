SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, as he tries to court the non-white vote. In an interview with Fox News, Trump denied "flip-flopping" and proposed a path forward for undocumented immigrants to pay back taxes without offering amnesty. This contradicts his previous promises to deport them. Trump has also made misleading statements about the safety of inner cities, claiming that war zones are safer than America's inner cities run by Democrats. He further stated that African American communities are suffering from Democratic control, with a 58% unemployment rate among youth, which is statistically misleading and offensive to the voters he is trying to reach.

END OF SUMMARY.
