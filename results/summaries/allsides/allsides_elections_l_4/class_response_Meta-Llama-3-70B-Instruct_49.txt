SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been met with skepticism, and his words have been labeled as "lies." Trump's initial hardline stance on immigration involved building a wall along the US-Mexico border and deporting undocumented migrants. However, he has since waffled on his position, suggesting that immigrants not in the US legally would not get citizenship but could still pay back taxes and work with the government. This apparent moderation comes as Trump tries to aggressively court Hispanic and African American voters, who have been "failed" and "hurting" due to poverty, rejection, and crime. Trump's claims about crime rates and African American unemployment have been disputed, with experts calling them "misleading" and "offensive." Despite his attempts to reach out to these communities, Trump's words have been met with criticism, and his campaign has been accused of "manipulation." 

END OF SUMMARY.
