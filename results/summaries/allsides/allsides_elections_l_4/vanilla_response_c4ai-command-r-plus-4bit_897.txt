SUMMARY: Donald Trump's stance on immigration has been a central issue of his campaign, with his initial proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. However, his position has softened, and he now suggests a path forward for undocumented immigrants, including paying back taxes with no amnesty. Trump is trying to court Hispanic and African American voters, but his statements about inner cities being more dangerous than war zones and high unemployment rates among African Americans have been controversial. Trump's claim that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed is misleading, as it includes those outside the labor force who are not actively seeking employment. Economists argue that it is not accurate to include these individuals in unemployment calculations. Trump's outreach to African American voters has been met with skepticism, and polls show low support for him among this demographic. 

END OF SUMMARY.
