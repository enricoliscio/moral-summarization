SUMMARY: This week, Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, the signature issue of his campaign, and attempted to court the non-white vote by addressing African American unemployment and the safety of inner cities. However, his statements were riddled with *lies* and morally questionable assertions. Trump has long advocated for an *hardline* stance on immigration, proposing a wall along the US-Mexico border and a "deportation force" to remove undocumented migrants. Yet, he now appears to be offering a path forward for immigrants, contradicting his previous promises of *deportation*. In a speech in Akron, Ohio, Trump claimed that US inner cities are more dangerous than war zones and that Democrats have *failed* the African American community, citing *crime*, *poverty*, *rejection*, and lack of *housing*. He also asserted that African American youth unemployment is at 58%, a statistic that has been deemed *misleading* as it includes those not actively seeking employment. Trump's attempts to appeal to non-white voters may fall flat, as polling shows him trailing Hillary Clinton significantly among this demographic. END OF SUMMARY.
