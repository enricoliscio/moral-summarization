SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign. Despite previously promising to deport undocumented migrants, Trump now suggests they will "pay back taxes" and work with authorities. This shift comes as Trump tries to court non-white voters, particularly African Americans and Hispanics. However, his attempts to connect with these communities have been marred by offensive language and misleading statistics. Trump claimed that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, citing high crime rates, but crime statistics show a steady decline since 1991. He also exaggerated African American youth unemployment, claiming 58% are unemployed, when the actual rate is 25.7%. Trump's campaign has been criticized for its manipulation of data and divisive rhetoric.

END OF SUMMARY.
