SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been met with skepticism, and his words have been deemed "offensive" to the very voters he's trying to reach. Trump's rhetoric on inner cities, where he claims it's "safer" to be in war zones than in these areas, has been criticized for being a "bleak" and inaccurate portrayal of reality. His statement that 58% of African American youth are unemployed has been disputed, with economists calling it "misleading". Trump's campaign has been plagued by "lies" and "misleading" statements, and his attempts to reach out to African American and Hispanic voters have been met with widespread criticism. Despite this, Trump continues to try to appeal to these groups, claiming that he can offer them a better future than the "failed" policies of the Democrats. END OF SUMMARY.
