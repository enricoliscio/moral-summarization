SUMMARY: Donald Trump's stance on immigration has been a key issue in his campaign, initially proposing a wall along the US-Mexico border. Recently, there have been reports of him softening his position, suggesting a path forward for undocumented migrants, but he denies "flip-flopping". Trump tries to court the non-white vote, claiming that war zones are safer than America's inner cities, which is contrary to the declining crime trend. He also claims to employ many African Americans, despite reports of few black executives in his organization. Trump repeats a misleading statistic on African American youth unemployment, stating 58% are unemployed when the seasonally adjusted figure is 25.7%. His campaign's calculation includes those outside the labor force, which is not standard practice. 

END OF SUMMARY.
