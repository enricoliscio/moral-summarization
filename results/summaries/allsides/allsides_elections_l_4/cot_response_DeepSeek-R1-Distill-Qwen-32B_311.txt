Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the article is about. It's about Donald Trump's campaign, specifically his shifts on immigration policies and his outreach to African American and Hispanic voters. 

The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. From the article, words like "lies," "deportation," "amnesty," "failed," "horrible," "crime," "unemployed," "suffering," "misleading," and "statistically" stand out as having moral connotations. These words are used to critique Trump's statements and policies.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article. I should make sure to include these morally framed words to maintain the original tone. The summary should be under 200 words and highlight Trump's softened stance on immigration, his claims about inner cities being unsafe, the unemployment statistics, and the criticism he's facing.

I'll structure the summary to mention his shift on immigration, the contradictions in his statements, the false claims about crime rates, the misleading unemployment figures, and the overall criticism of his approach to courting minority voters. This should capture the essence of the article while preserving the moral framing.

* Misleading  
* Statistically  

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses Donald Trump's evolving stance on immigration, his claims about inner city safety, and his outreach to African American voters. Trump initially promised a "deportation force" for undocumented immigrants but later softened his position, suggesting they could stay and pay taxes without amnesty. Critics argue this contradicts his earlier hardline rhetoric. Trump also claimed that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, despite crime statistics showing a long-term decline. Additionally, he cited a misleading 58% unemployment rate among young African Americans, which experts criticized as statistically flawed. Trump's efforts to court minority voters have been met with skepticism, as polls show he trails significantly among non-white voters. His statements and policies have been widely criticized for being inconsistent and misleading.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
