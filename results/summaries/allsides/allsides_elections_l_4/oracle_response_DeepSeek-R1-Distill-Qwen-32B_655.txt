Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My goal is to create a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump softening his immigration stance, his claims about inner cities being unsafe, and his use of misleading unemployment statistics. The author uses words like "lies," "failed," "crime," and "misleading" to frame these issues morally.

I should start by mentioning Trump's softened stance on immigration, using words like "pay" and "deportation." Then, I'll touch on his claims about inner cities being unsafe, using "failed," "poverty," and "crime." Next, I'll address the unemployment statistics, highlighting how they're misleading and the impact on African American communities.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point while incorporating the moral language. I'll also keep an eye on the word count to stay within the limit. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
The article highlights Donald Trump's shifting stance on immigration, where he softened his hardline approach, suggesting undocumented immigrants could "pay back taxes" and "work with them," though he denied flip-flopping. This moderation came as Trump sought to court non-white voters, particularly Hispanics and African Americans, amid polling showing him trailing Hillary Clinton among non-white voters. Trump also claimed that inner cities, "run by the Democrats," were more dangerous than war zones, a statement criticized for its offensive tone and disregard for declining crime rates. Additionally, Trump's campaign cited misleading statistics about African American unemployment, claiming 58% of young black individuals were unemployed, a figure discredited by economists. The article underscores Trump's use of morally charged language, such as "failed," "poverty," "crime," and "misleading," to frame his rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
