SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, while trying to court non-white voters. However, his words are filled with lies and manipulation. He claims that undocumented immigrants will "pay back taxes" and "work with them," but his previous promises of deportation contradict this new stance. Trump's attempt to appeal to African American voters is also marred by his offensive language, where he describes inner cities as "war zones" and claims that crime is at "levels that nobody's seen," despite evidence showing a steady decline in crime rates since 1991. Furthermore, his claim that 58% of African American youth are unemployed is a misleading statistic that has been debunked by economists. Trump's failure to understand the struggles of African American communities and his use of manipulation to sway voters are a testament to his flawed campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
