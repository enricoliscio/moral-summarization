SUMMARY: GOP nominee Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, and tried to court the non-white vote by addressing African American unemployment and claiming US inner cities are war zones. He told Sean Hannity that immigrants would pay back taxes but stopped short of promising citizenship. This contradicts his previous proposals for mass deportations. Trump's attempts to appeal to minority voters come as polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton among non-white voters.

Trump made the offensive claim that US inner cities, run by Democrats, are more dangerous than war zones. This is contrary to the fact that crime in America has been declining for over two decades. He also misleadingly stated that 58% of African American youth are unemployed, a figure arrived at by including those not actively seeking employment in the calculation.

Trump's softening on immigration and outreach to minority voters highlight his campaign's efforts to broaden its appeal. However, his offensive language and misleading statements continue to alienate the very voters he is trying to attract. END OF SUMMARY.
