SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his words have been laced with lies and morally dubious statements. He claimed that immigrants would "pay back taxes" and that there would be "no amnesty," but also offered a path forward, contradicting his previous promises of deportation. Trump's rhetoric on African American unemployment has been particularly misleading, citing a false statistic that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed. In reality, the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Trump's comments on inner cities, where he claimed that war zones are safer, have been deemed offensive and bleak. His outreach to African American voters has been met with skepticism, with only 1% of African American voters supporting him. END OF SUMMARY.
