SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, while trying to court non-white voters. However, his words are filled with lies and contradictions. He claims that undocumented migrants will "pay back taxes" and "work with them," but denies offering amnesty. Trump's campaign has a history of failed promises, including a "deportation force" to remove undocumented migrants. His recent speeches have been filled with offensive language, portraying America's inner cities as war zones, safer than actual war zones. He claims that crime is at record heights, despite evidence showing a decline in crime rates over the past quarter century. Trump also misleads on African American unemployment, citing a false statistic of 58% youth unemployment. In reality, the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Trump's campaign is built on lies, failed promises, and misleading information, hurting the very voters he's trying to reach.

END OF SUMMARY.
