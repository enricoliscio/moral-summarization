SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his lies and contradictory statements have raised eyebrows. Trump claimed that undocumented immigrants would "pay back taxes" and "work with them," but denied that he was "flip-flopping" on his previous promises of deportation. He also made offensive remarks about African American communities, saying they are "hurting" and "suffering" from Democratic control, with "poverty," "rejection," and "crime" at "levels that nobody's seen." However, crime statistics show a steady decline since 1991. Trump's claims of employing many African Americans were also debunked, and his outreach to African American voters has been met with skepticism. His lies and misleading statements have been exposed, and his attempts to moderate his stance on immigration have been seen as an attempt to gain votes.

END OF SUMMARY.
