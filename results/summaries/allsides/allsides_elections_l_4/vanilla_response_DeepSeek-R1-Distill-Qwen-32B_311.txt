Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's campaign shifts. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Trump softening his stance on immigration, which was a big part of his campaign. He initially wanted a wall and deportation, but now he's suggesting something else, like paying back taxes without amnesty. He's trying to court Hispanic and African American voters, who aren't supporting him much, as shown by the polls.

Then there's his claim about inner cities being more dangerous than war zones, which doesn't match the crime statistics that have been declining. He also made a point about employing many African Americans, but evidence shows few in his upper management. 

He also mentioned the 58% unemployment rate among young African Americans, but that number is misleading because it includes people not looking for jobs, like students. 

So, the summary needs to capture these key points: softening on immigration, courting minority voters, false claims about crime and unemployment. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and uses the tokens as specified. Let me structure it to cover each main point briefly.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue of his campaign, suggesting undocumented immigrants could pay back taxes and find a path to legal status without amnesty. This shift comes as Trump attempts to court Hispanic and African American voters, who polls show largely favor Hillary Clinton. Trump also claimed that America's inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, a statement contradicted by declining crime statistics. Additionally, he inaccurately cited a 58% unemployment rate among young African Americans, a figure that includes those not seeking employment, making it misleading. Trump's outreach to minority voters faces challenges, as he struggles to gain support from these communities. END OF SUMMARY.
