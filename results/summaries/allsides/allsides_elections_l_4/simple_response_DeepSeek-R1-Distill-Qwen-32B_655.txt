Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article talks about Donald Trump's campaign strategies, specifically his stance on immigration and his efforts to court non-white voters. He softened his position on immigration, which was a big part of his campaign. He mentioned that undocumented immigrants would have to pay back taxes and there's no amnesty, but they could be worked with. He also tried to address African American unemployment, claiming high rates, but the statistics were misleading.

The author seems critical of Trump. They point out that his claims about crime rates being higher than in war zones are inaccurate, as crime has been declining. Also, the unemployment statistic he used was misleading because it included people not actively seeking jobs. The author also mentions that Trump's businesses don't have many black executives despite his claims.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points and the moral critique. It should highlight how Trump's statements are misleading, his contradictory positions, and the potential insensitivity towards the communities he's trying to reach. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump softening his immigration stance, mention the misleading unemployment stats, critique his crime rate claims, and note the lack of black executives in his businesses. Conclude with the moral implications of his tactics.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Make sure it's clear and flows well. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue of his campaign, suggesting a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants while denying amnesty. This shift comes as he attempts to court non-white voters, particularly Hispanics and African Americans, amid lagging poll numbers. Trump's claims about high African American unemployment rates were found misleading, as his campaign inflated the figure by including non-job seekers. Additionally, his assertion that American inner cities are more dangerous than war zones contradicts declining crime trends, with critics noting the inaccuracy of his claims. Trump's outreach efforts to African American communities have been criticized, as his businesses reportedly lack black executives despite his claims of employing many. His statements have been seen as insincere and exploitative, raising ethical concerns about his campaign tactics. END OF SUMMARY.
