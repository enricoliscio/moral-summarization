Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's recent campaign moves. The article talks about him softening his stance on immigration, trying to court Hispanic and African American voters, and making some controversial statements about inner cities and unemployment. 

First, I should identify the main points. Trump is changing his hardline immigration policy, suggesting a path to citizenship without amnesty, which he previously opposed. He's also meeting with African American and Latino groups, trying to gain their support. However, his claims about high unemployment rates among African Americans are being questioned because the actual numbers are much lower.

Next, I need to note that his campaign is facing criticism for these statements, especially since they don't align with the facts. Polls show he's trailing Clinton among non-white voters, and his business doesn't have many black executives despite his claims of employing many African Americans.

I should structure the summary to cover these points concisely. Start with the softened immigration stance, then mention the outreach to minority groups, followed by the misleading unemployment statistics and the criticism. Make sure to keep it under 200 words and within the required format.

I also need to ensure the summary is clear and factual, avoiding any personal opinions. It should reflect the key developments and criticisms without going into too much detail. Let me piece it together, making sure each main point is addressed succinctly.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, suggesting a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants without amnesty, contradicting his earlier hardline deportation promises. This shift comes as he seeks to court Hispanic and African American voters, trailing Hillary Clinton in polls among non-white voters. Trump also claimed that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, a statement criticized for its inaccuracy and offensive tone. Additionally, he repeated a statistic claiming 58% of young African Americans are unemployed, which economists say is misleading as it includes those not seeking employment. Trump's outreach to minority groups faces skepticism due to his controversial statements and lack of support among African American voters. END OF SUMMARY.
