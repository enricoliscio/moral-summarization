SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his lies and contradictions have been exposed. He claims that undocumented immigrants will "pay back taxes" and "work with them," but denies offering amnesty. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has also waffled on deportation. Trump's immigration reform proposal is a stark departure from his initial hardline stance. He has also made offensive remarks about African American communities, claiming they are "suffering" from Democratic control and that 58% of their youth is unemployed, a statistic that has been debunked. In reality, the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Trump's lies and manipulation of crime statistics have also been exposed, as he claims that crime is at record heights, despite a steady decline since 1991. His rhetoric is a clear attempt to deceive and mislead voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
