SUMMARY: GOP nominee Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, and tried to court the non-white vote by addressing African American unemployment. However, he told several lies this week regarding various issues. On immigration, Trump denied that he was "flip-flopping" and claimed that undocumented immigrants would pay back taxes and there would be no amnesty. However, his previous promises of a deportation force and his proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border contradict these statements. Trump also made misleading statements about the safety of inner cities, claiming that they are more dangerous than war zones in countries where the US is engaged in military action. He further exaggerated African American unemployment rates, claiming they were at 58% when the actual seasonally adjusted rate for 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Trump's outreach to African American voters has been questionable, as he delivers his speeches before largely white audiences and has the support of only 1% of African American voters according to a recent poll.
END OF SUMMARY.
