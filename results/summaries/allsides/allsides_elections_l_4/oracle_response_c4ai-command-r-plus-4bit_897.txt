SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, as he tries to court the non-white vote. In a town hall meeting, he denied "flip-flopping" and proposed that immigrants in the US illegally would pay back taxes and not receive citizenship, contradicting his previous promises of deportation. Trump also made misleading claims about the safety of inner cities, stating that war zones are safer than Democrat-run inner cities, despite a decline in crime over the past decades. He further asserted that he employs "so many" African Americans, yet an analysis revealed few to no black executives in his organization. Trump has been reaching out to African American voters, citing their suffering under Democratic control and high unemployment rates, but his speeches are delivered to largely white audiences. The Trump campaign used misleading calculations to arrive at an unemployment rate of 58% for young black Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
