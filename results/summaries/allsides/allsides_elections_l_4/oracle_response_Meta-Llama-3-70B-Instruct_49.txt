SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been marred by lies and misinformation. Trump's initial hardline stance on immigration included a "deportation force" to remove the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants living in America. But after meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, reports emerged that he was softening his stance, offering a path forward for undocumented migrants. Trump's campaign has been marked by lies, including his claim that crime is at record heights, when in fact, crime statistics show a steady decline since 1991. He has also made offensive remarks, such as claiming that war zones are safer than America's inner cities, and that African American communities are suffering from Democratic control, with 58% of their youth unemployed, a statistic that has been debunked as misleading. Trump's attempts to reach out to African American and Hispanic voters have been met with skepticism, as his speeches are often delivered to largely white audiences.
