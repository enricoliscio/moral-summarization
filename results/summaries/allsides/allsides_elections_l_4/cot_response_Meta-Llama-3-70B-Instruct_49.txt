SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been met with skepticism. He has suggested that undocumented migrants will "pay back taxes" and that there will be "no amnesty," but has also offered a path forward. Trump has also made questionable claims about African American unemployment, stating that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed, when in fact the unemployment rate is 25.7%. Additionally, Trump has described inner cities as "war zones" that are "safer" than actual war zones, using language that is offensive to the very voters he's trying to reach. His bleak picture of crime-ridden American streets runs counter to a trend of declining crime. Trump's outreach to African American voters has been met with skepticism, with only 1% of African American voters supporting him. END OF SUMMARY.
