SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims and statistics have been misleading and offensive. He has falsely stated that crime is at record heights, when in fact, crime rates have been declining for over 25 years. He has also exaggerated African American unemployment rates, claiming 58% of youth are unemployed, when the actual rate is 25.7%. Furthermore, Trump's language has been offensive, comparing inner cities to war zones and implying that African Americans have nothing to lose by voting for him. His attempts to reach out to African American and Latino voters have been met with skepticism, as his campaign has a history of making false promises and using misleading statistics.

END OF SUMMARY.
