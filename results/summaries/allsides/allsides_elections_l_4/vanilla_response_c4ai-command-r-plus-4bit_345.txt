SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, suggesting a path forward for undocumented immigrants to remain in the US legally without offering citizenship. This shift comes as he tries to court Hispanic and African American voters, as polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton significantly among non-white voters. Trump has made controversial statements, claiming US inner cities are more dangerous than war zones and that 58% of African American youth are unemployed, a misleading statistic that includes those not actively seeking employment. Trump's outreach to African American voters has been criticized as his speeches are delivered to largely white audiences, and he has few if any black executives in his organization. Trump's campaign manager denied he was "flip-flopping" on immigration, but the shift marks a notable change in his hardline stance.
END OF SUMMARY.
