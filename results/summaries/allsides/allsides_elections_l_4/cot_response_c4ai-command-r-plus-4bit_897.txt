SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has been accused of softening his stance on immigration, the signature issue of his campaign, and telling lies about his position on the matter. He has tried to court the non-white vote, but is trailing Hillary Clinton by a significant margin among non-white voters. 

In a recent speech in Akron, Ohio, Trump made controversial claims about the state of America's inner cities, saying that "war zones are safer than [some] inner cities," and that Democrats have failed the African American communities, resulting in high levels of poverty, rejection, horrible education, crime, and unemployment. He urged African Americans to consider what they had to lose by continuing to support Democratic politicians. 

Trump and his campaign have also come under fire for their misleading use of unemployment statistics regarding the African American community. They claimed that 58% of African American youth are unemployed, a figure that has been deemed statistically misleading by economists.
