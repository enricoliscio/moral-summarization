SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, as he tries to court the Hispanic and African American vote. He has previously proposed building a wall along the US-Mexico border and creating a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants. However, in recent statements, he has suggested that immigrants could pay back taxes and find a path to legalization without amnesty. Trump has also made misleading statements about the safety of inner cities, claiming that they are more dangerous than war zones, and that Democrats have failed to address high crime rates and poverty. He cited an inflated statistic of 58% unemployment among young black Americans, which has been criticized as statistically misleading. Trump's attempts to appeal to minority voters may be falling flat, as polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton significantly among non-white voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
