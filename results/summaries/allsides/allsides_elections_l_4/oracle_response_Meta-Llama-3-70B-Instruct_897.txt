SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, while trying to court non-white voters. However, his lies and contradictory statements have raised eyebrows. He claimed that undocumented immigrants would "pay back taxes" and "work with them," but denied that he was "flip-flopping" on his previous promises of deportation. Trump's campaign has also been accused of using misleading statistics, such as the claim that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed, when in reality the unemployment rate is 25.7%.

Trump's rhetoric has been offensive to the very voters he's trying to reach, with claims that inner cities are "war zones" and that crime is at "levels that nobody's seen." However, crime statistics show a steady decline since 1991. Trump's speeches, delivered to largely white audiences, have been criticized for failing to address the real issues facing African American communities, such as poverty, rejection, and lack of education, housing, and ownership.

Trump's attempts to court African American and Hispanic voters have been met with skepticism, with polls showing him trailing Hillary Clinton by a significant margin. His lies and misleading statements have only added to the distrust. END OF SUMMARY.
