SUMMARY:
Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been met with skepticism, and his words have been deemed "offensive" to the very voters he's trying to reach. Trump's rhetoric on inner cities, where he claims "crime is at levels that nobody's seen," is particularly problematic, as it runs counter to the trend of declining crime rates over the past quarter century. Furthermore, his claim that 58% of African American youth are unemployed is a "misleading" statistic, as it includes labor force participants and those outside the labor force, such as students and retirees. Trump's "lies" and "failed" attempts to connect with African American and Hispanic voters have been exposed, and his campaign's efforts to rebrand him as a more moderate candidate have been met with skepticism. END OF SUMMARY.
