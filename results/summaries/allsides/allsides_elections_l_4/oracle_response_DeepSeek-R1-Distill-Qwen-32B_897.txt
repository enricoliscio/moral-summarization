Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Donald Trump's campaign, focusing on his stance on immigration, his outreach to non-white voters, and some of his statements regarding African American unemployment and crime rates. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Trump softened his immigration stance, which was a key part of his campaign. He talked about African American unemployment to court non-white voters. The article also mentions that Trump's claims about crime rates and unemployment were misleading or false.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like lies, stance, remove, rounding, legalized, moderation, failed, hurting, poverty, crime, employ, offensive, misleading, etc. I should structure the summary to cover Trump's shift on immigration, his attempt to appeal to Hispanic and African American voters, the misleading statistics he used, and the criticism he received for his statements.

I'll start by mentioning Trump softening his immigration stance, using words like "moderation" and "stance." Then, I'll talk about his outreach to non-white voters, using "employ" and "court." Next, I'll address the misleading statistics on unemployment and crime, using "misleading" and "failed." I should also include how his statements were seen as offensive and his claims were contradicted by data.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without going into too much detail. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to reflect the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary:

"Trump softened his immigration stance, offering a path to legalization for undocumented migrants, though critics accused him of flip-flopping. He attempted to court non-white voters by addressing African American unemployment, claiming over 58% of young black individuals were unemployed. However, this figure was misleading, as it included those not actively seeking employment. Trump also criticized Democratic-run inner cities, claiming they were more dangerous than war zones, despite crime rates declining nationally. His statements were seen as offensive and factually incorrect. Despite outreach efforts, polls showed minimal support among African American voters. Trump's campaign faced criticism for using misleading data and making false claims about immigration and urban safety."

I think that covers the main points and includes the morally framed words. Let me check the word count. It's around 150 words, so I can add a bit more if needed, but I think it's sufficient.
