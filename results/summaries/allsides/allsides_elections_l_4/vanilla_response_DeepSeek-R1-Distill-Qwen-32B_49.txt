Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's recent actions and statements. The article talks about him softening his stance on immigration, meeting with Hispanic and African American groups, and making some controversial claims about crime and unemployment rates. 

First, I should identify the main points. Trump is changing his hardline immigration policy to try to attract more non-white voters. He mentioned a path for undocumented immigrants, which is a shift from his previous deportation stance. He also criticized the Democrats for failing in inner cities, comparing them to war zones, which is a strong statement. Additionally, he cited high unemployment rates among African Americans, but the numbers he used were misleading because they included people not actively seeking jobs.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers these key points. I'll structure it by mentioning his softened immigration stance, his outreach to minority voters, the claims about inner cities, and the misleading unemployment statistics. Also, I should note that his support among African Americans is low, as per the polls.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in the details, like the specific dates or the exact wording, unless they're crucial. The focus is on Trump's strategy and the implications of his statements. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, connecting his actions with his campaign goals and the reactions or criticisms he's facing.

Now, putting it all together, I'll start with his immigration shift, then move to his claims about inner cities, followed by the unemployment statistics, and end with the low support among African Americans. I need to keep each point brief and clear, ensuring the summary is accurate and within the word limit.

I should also check for any potential errors, like mixing up the statistics or misrepresenting his statements. Making sure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content without adding personal opinions or extra information is crucial. 

Alright, time to draft the summary, keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's clear and covers all the main points.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, suggesting a path for undocumented immigrants while denying a flip-flop, as he courts Hispanic and African American voters. He criticized inner cities as more dangerous than war zones, despite crime statistics showing a decline. Trump also cited misleadingly high unemployment rates among African Americans, using data that included non-job seekers. Despite these efforts, polls show Trump has minimal support among African American voters. END OF SUMMARY.
