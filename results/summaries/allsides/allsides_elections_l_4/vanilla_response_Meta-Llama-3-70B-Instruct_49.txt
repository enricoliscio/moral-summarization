SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign, and is now trying to court non-white voters. After meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants would not be deported, but would have to pay back taxes and work with the government. This is a shift from his previous promise to deport 11 million undocumented migrants. Trump is also trying to appeal to African American voters, claiming that they have been failed by Democratic politicians and that crime is at record heights in inner cities. However, fact-checkers have found that Trump's claims about crime statistics and African American unemployment are misleading or false. Trump's campaign has been criticized for using flawed data to arrive at a statistic that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed, when the actual unemployment rate is around 25.7%.
