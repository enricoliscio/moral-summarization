SUMMARY:
Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been deemed "lies" and "misleading" by critics. Trump's rhetoric on immigration has been ultra-hardline, but he recently appeared to offer a path forward for undocumented migrants, contradicting his previous promises of deportation. Meanwhile, Trump's comments on African American unemployment have been criticized as "offensive" and "horrible". He claimed that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed, but this figure has been disputed as "misleading" and "statistically misleading". Trump's bleak portrait of America's inner cities, where he claims crime is at "levels that nobody's seen", has also been disputed as running counter to a trend of declining crime. Overall, Trump's attempts to reach out to non-white voters have been met with skepticism and criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
