SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, stating that undocumented immigrants would pay back taxes and not be granted amnesty, but also not be deported. This shift in position comes as Trump tries to appeal to Hispanic and African American voters, as polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton among non-white voters. In a speech in Akron, Ohio, Trump claimed that US inner cities are more dangerous than war zones in countries where the US is engaged in military action, a statement that has been widely criticized as offensive and inaccurate. Trump also repeated a misleading statistic on African American youth unemployment, claiming it to be 58% when the actual figure is significantly lower at 25.7%. Trump's campaign adviser, David Malpass, defended this figure by stating that it includes those outside the labor force who are not actively seeking employment, which is not how unemployment rates are typically calculated. END OF SUMMARY.
