SUMMARY: Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, and attempted to appeal to African American and Latino voters by addressing unemployment in these communities. However, his claims about the safety of inner cities and African American unemployment rates are misleading and offensive.

Trump has previously proposed building a wall along the US-Mexico border and creating a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants. This week, he appeared to soften his stance, suggesting that undocumented immigrants could pay back taxes and find a path to legalization without amnesty. This shift comes as Trump tries to court Hispanic and African American voters, as polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton significantly among non-white voters.

Trump made misleading claims in his attempts to appeal to these voters. He stated that war zones are safer than America's inner cities, which are run by Democrats, a statement that is offensive and contradicts the trend of declining crime rates over the past 25 years. He also claimed that 58% of African American youth are unemployed, a statistic that is misleading as it includes those outside the labor force, such as students and retirees, who are not counted as unemployed by the federal government.

END OF SUMMARY.
