SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. Despite previously promising to deport undocumented migrants, Trump now says they will have to pay back taxes and work with the government. This shift in stance comes as Trump trails Hillary Clinton in polls, particularly among non-white voters. Trump has also made questionable claims about African American unemployment, stating that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed, when in reality the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Furthermore, Trump has made offensive comments about inner cities, claiming they are more dangerous than war zones, which is not supported by crime statistics. Trump's attempts to reach out to African American and Hispanic voters ring hollow, given his history of divisive rhetoric and lack of concrete policy proposals. END OF SUMMARY.
