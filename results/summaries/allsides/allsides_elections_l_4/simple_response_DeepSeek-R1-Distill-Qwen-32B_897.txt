Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's recent actions and statements. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points where Trump's messaging is either contradictory, misleading, or problematic.

First, the article mentions Trump softening his stance on immigration. He's trying to appeal to Hispanic and African American voters, but his earlier hardline policies were a big part of his campaign. That seems like a flip-flop, which could be seen as inconsistent or insincere.

Next, he claims that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones. That's a strong statement, but the article points out that crime rates have actually been declining. Using this to criticize Democrats might be misleading and could be seen as insensitive to those affected by crime.

Then, there's the issue of African American unemployment. Trump uses a statistic that 58% are unemployed, but the actual numbers are much lower. By including people not seeking jobs, his campaign is misrepresenting the data, which is misleading and could be seen as manipulating facts for political gain.

I should make sure the summary highlights these points, showing how Trump's statements are either contradictory, misleading, or problematic in their framing. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll need to be concise but cover all these aspects.

Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each paragraph addresses one main issue: immigration stance, inner city safety claims, and unemployment statistics. Each should reflect the moral critique from the article.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, as he attempts to court non-white voters. Despite earlier promises of a "deportation force" and no amnesty, Trump recently suggested undocumented immigrants could stay if they pay taxes, though he denied flip-flopping. His campaign has also delayed a speech to fine-tune his message. Meanwhile, Trump claimed American inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, despite declining crime rates, and criticized Democratic policies. He also cited a misleading 58% unemployment rate among young African Americans, using flawed data that includes those not seeking employment. These statements raise concerns about Trump's consistency, accuracy, and sensitivity in addressing issues affecting minority communities. END OF SUMMARY.
