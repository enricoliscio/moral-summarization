SUMMARY: In a week of softening stances and lies, Donald Trump contradicted himself on immigration, lied about inner city safety, and inflated African American unemployment rates as he tried to court non-white voters. On immigration, he denied "flip-flopping", but appeared to offer a path forward for undocumented migrants, despite previously promising deportation. Despite his claims, US inner cities are not more dangerous than war zones, and crime rates have been declining for over 25 years. Trump's claim of employing "so many" African Americans is also dubious, as few black executives are found in his organization. Lastly, Trump inflated African American youth unemployment to 58%, despite BLS figures placing it at 25.7%. These misleading statements and lies raise serious ethical concerns about the integrity of Trump's campaign and his respect for the truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
