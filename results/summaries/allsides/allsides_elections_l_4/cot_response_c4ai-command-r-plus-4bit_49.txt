SUMMARY: 
In a recent shift, GOP nominee Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign. This comes as Trump tries to court the non-white vote, particularly African American and Hispanic voters. However, his statements and actions have been morally questionable. Trump has been caught lying about various issues, including immigration and the safety of inner cities. He has also been accused of using offensive language and presenting a bleak and misleading picture of America's inner cities. 

On immigration, Trump has waffled between proposing a deportation force and suggesting a path to legalization for undocumented migrants, claiming there will be "no amnesty". Meanwhile, he has tried to dial up his outreach to African American voters, but his statements on their communities have been offensive and morally problematic. For example, he claimed that war zones are safer than America's inner cities, which is factually inaccurate and a broad-brush generalization. 

Trump and his campaign have also raised eyebrows with misleading statistics, such as claiming a 58% unemployment rate among young black Americans. Economists have called this misleading, as it includes segments of the population not actively seeking employment. 

Trump's moral framing and softening of stances may be a strategic move to gain support from non-white voters, but it remains to be seen whether it will be successful.
END OF SUMMARY.
