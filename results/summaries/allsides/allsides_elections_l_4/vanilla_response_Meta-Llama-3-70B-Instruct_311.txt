SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign. After meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants could pay back taxes and work with the government, contradicting his previous promises of deportation. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, also waffled on whether Trump still supports deportation. Trump is trying to court non-white voters, particularly Hispanics and African Americans, as he trails Hillary Clinton in polls. Trump also made questionable claims about crime rates, stating that war zones are safer than America's inner cities, which is not supported by crime statistics. Additionally, Trump incorrectly stated that 58% of African American youth are unemployed, when the actual rate is 25.7%.

END OF SUMMARY.
