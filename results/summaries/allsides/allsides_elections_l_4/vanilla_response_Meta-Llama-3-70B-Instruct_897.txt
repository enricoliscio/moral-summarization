SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign, and is now trying to court non-white voters. After meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants would not be deported, but would have to pay back taxes and work with the government. This is a shift from his previous hardline stance on immigration. Trump is also trying to appeal to African American voters, claiming that Democratic policies have failed them and that they have nothing to lose by supporting him. However, Trump's claims about crime rates and African American unemployment have been disputed as false or misleading. Despite his efforts, Trump trails Hillary Clinton in polls, particularly among non-white voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
