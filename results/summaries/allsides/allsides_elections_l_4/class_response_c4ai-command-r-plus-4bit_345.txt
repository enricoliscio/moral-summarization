SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign has been characterized by hardline stances on issues like immigration, but recent statements suggest a softening of his position. Trump previously proposed building a wall along the US-Mexico border and deporting undocumented immigrants, but now appears to offer a path forward for those willing to pay back taxes. This moderation comes as Trump courts Hispanic and African American voters, trailing Hillary Clinton by a significant margin among non-white voters. Trump's claims about inner cities being more dangerous than war zones and high African American unemployment rates are misleading and offensive to the very voters he's trying to reach. The manipulation of statistics to support his claims is morally questionable.

END OF SUMMARY.
