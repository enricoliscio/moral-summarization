Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump softening his stance on immigration, trying to court non-white voters, and making some controversial statements about inner cities and African American unemployment.

I notice the author uses words like "lies," "undocumented," "deported," "failed," "crime," "manipulation," and "misleading." I should incorporate these into the summary.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning Trump softening his immigration stance, using "lies" and "undocumented." Then, I'll touch on his claims about inner cities being unsafe, using "failed," "crime," and "manipulation." Finally, I'll address the unemployment statistics, highlighting "misleading."

I should structure it to show Trump's shift in policy, his outreach efforts, and the criticism regarding his statements and statistics. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is key. I'll make sure each sentence includes the moral terms where appropriate without making it sound forced.

Alright, putting it all together now, ensuring I hit all the main points and include the necessary moral language.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, while attempting to court non-white voters. He claimed undocumented migrants would pay back taxes and work without amnesty, though his statements on deportation and citizenship remain contradictory. Trump also criticized the Democrats for failing in inner cities, claiming they are more dangerous than war zones, despite crime statistics showing a long-term decline. His outreach to African American voters included addressing high unemployment rates, citing a misleading 58% unemployment rate among young black Americans, which experts say overestimates the issue by including non-job seekers. Trump's statements and policies have been criticized for being manipulative, offensive, and statistically misleading, while his campaign trails significantly among non-white voters. END OF SUMMARY.
