SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign. After meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants might be allowed to stay in the US and pay back taxes, contradicting his previous promises of deportation. This shift in stance comes as Trump tries to court non-white voters, particularly African Americans and Hispanics. However, his attempts to connect with these groups have been marred by misinformation and offensive language. Trump claimed that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, and that 58% of young black Americans are unemployed, both of which are false. Economists have criticized Trump's method of calculating unemployment rates, saying it is statistically misleading. Trump's rhetoric has been criticized for being divisive and harmful, and his attempts to reach out to non-white voters have been met with skepticism.

END OF SUMMARY.
