SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been filled with lies and misleading information. He has denied "flip-flopping" on deportation, but his words suggest a more moderate approach, saying undocumented immigrants will "pay back taxes" and "work with them." This comes after meeting with his Hispanic advisory council and African American and Latino activists. Trump's rhetoric is riddled with offensive language, using war zones as a comparison to America's inner cities, which he claims are "crime-ridden" and "safer" than war zones. He also makes misleading claims about African American unemployment, stating that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed, when in reality the number is 25.7%. Trump's lies and manipulation of statistics are a stark contrast to the reality of declining crime rates and suffering African American communities.

END OF SUMMARY.
