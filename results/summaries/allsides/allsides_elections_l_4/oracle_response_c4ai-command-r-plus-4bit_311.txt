SUMMARY: GOP nominee Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, while trying to court the non-white vote. He denied that he was "flip-flopping" and postponed a speech on the issue. Trump has previously proposed building a wall along the US-Mexico border and creating a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants. However, he now suggests that immigrants can "pay back taxes" and find a path forward. Trump's attempts to moderate his stance on immigration come as he tries to appeal to Hispanic and African American voters. He claims that Democratic control has failed inner cities, portraying them as unsafe and crime-ridden, which is misleading and offensive to the voters he seeks to attract. Trump also exaggerates African American unemployment rates, stating 58% of youth are unemployed, while the actual figure is 25.7%. Trump's campaign calculates this number by including those outside the labor force, which is misleading. Trump's economic adviser defends this calculation.
END OF SUMMARY.
