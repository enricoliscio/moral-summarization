SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, as he tries to court the non-white vote. He has previously proposed building a wall along the US-Mexico border and creating a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants. However, this week he suggested that immigrants not in the US legally would not get citizenship but also appeared to offer a path forward, contradicting his previous promises. Trump has also made misleading statements about crime in inner cities, claiming that they are more dangerous than war zones, and has exaggerated African American unemployment rates. His campaign calculated a figure of 58% unemployment among young black Americans by including those outside the labor force, which is statistically misleading. Trump's attempts to reach out to African American voters have been called into question as he delivers speeches before largely white audiences. His statements and tactics have been deemed offensive and manipulative by many.
END OF SUMMARY.
