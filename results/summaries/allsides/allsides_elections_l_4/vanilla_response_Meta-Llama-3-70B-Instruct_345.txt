SUMMARY:

Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign, and is now trying to court non-white voters. After meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants would not be deported, but would instead pay back taxes and work with the government. This marks a shift from his previous hardline stance on immigration. Trump is also trying to appeal to African American voters, claiming that Democratic policies have failed them and that he employs many African Americans in his businesses. However, fact-checking reveals that Trump's claims about crime rates and African American unemployment are exaggerated or misleading. Despite his efforts, Trump trails Hillary Clinton in polls, particularly among non-white voters.

END OF SUMMARY.
