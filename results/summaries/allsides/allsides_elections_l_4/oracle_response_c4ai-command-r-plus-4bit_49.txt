SUMMARY: Donald Trump's immigration stance has softened as he courts the Hispanic and African American vote. Despite previous promises to build a wall between Mexico and the US and to deport all undocumented migrants, Trump now suggests that immigrants without legal status could pay back taxes and be offered a path to legalization without amnesty. This moderation comes as Trump tries to appeal to non-white voters, where polling shows him trailing Hillary Clinton significantly.

Trump has also made misleading statements about the safety of inner cities, claiming that they are more dangerous than war zones in countries where the US is engaged in military action. He further asserted that Democrats have failed the inner cities, resulting in high crime rates, poverty, and a lack of education, housing, and ownership. However, studies show a steady decline in crime rates over the past 25 years.

Trump's outreach to African American voters includes highlighting the high unemployment rate among young black Americans, which his campaign calculated at 58% by including those outside the labor force. Economists have criticized this calculation as misleading. END OF SUMMARY.
