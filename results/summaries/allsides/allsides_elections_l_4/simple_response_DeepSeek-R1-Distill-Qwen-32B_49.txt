Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Donald Trump softening his stance on immigration, which was a big part of his campaign. He mentioned a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which is a change from his earlier hardline position. The article also points out that this shift is part of his strategy to court Hispanic and African American voters, as he's trailing in polls among non-white voters.

Then, there's the part about his comments on inner cities being more dangerous than war zones. The article criticizes this as misleading because crime rates have actually been declining. It also mentions that his claim about employing many African Americans doesn't hold up when looking at his business's executive ranks, which are mostly white.

Lastly, Trump used a statistic about 58% unemployment among young African Americans, but the article explains that this number is misleading because it includes people not actively seeking jobs, which isn't how unemployment is typically measured.

I need to summarize all this in under 200 words, keeping the moral critique intact. I should highlight the contradictions in his policies, the misleading claims, and the implications for voter outreach. I'll make sure to mention the softening on immigration, the false crime claims, and the unemployment statistics issue. Also, I should note the criticism about his business's lack of diversity.

I'll structure the summary by first addressing the immigration shift, then the crime remarks, followed by the unemployment stats, and finally the critique of his business practices. I need to keep it concise but cover all the main points with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, offering a potential path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a shift from his earlier hardline "deportation force" rhetoric. This moderation comes as Trump seeks to court Hispanic and African American voters, trailing significantly behind Hillary Clinton among non-white voters. Trump also claimed that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, a statement criticized as misleading, given the long-term decline in U.S. crime rates. Additionally, Trump cited a statistic that 58% of young African Americans are unemployed, which experts argue is misleading as it includes individuals not actively seeking employment. Trump's claims about employing many African Americans in his businesses were also called into question, as analyses found few black executives in his organization. His efforts to appeal to minority voters have been met with skepticism, as polling shows minimal support among African Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
