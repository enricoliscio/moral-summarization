Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's recent statements and actions. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

First, the article talks about Trump softening his stance on immigration. He initially proposed building a wall and deporting undocumented immigrants, but now he's suggesting a more moderate approach, like paying back taxes without amnesty. He met with Hispanic and African American activists, trying to court their votes. Polls show he's trailing behind Clinton among non-white voters, so this shift might be an attempt to gain more support.

Next, the article mentions Trump's claim that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones. This seems to be part of his strategy to contrast Democratic policies with his own, but the statistics don't back up his claims since crime rates have been declining. He also claims to employ many African Americans, but evidence shows few are in top positions in his organizations.

Then, there's the issue of African American unemployment. Trump cited a 58% unemployment rate, but the actual stats from BLS are much lower. His campaign's method of calculating this rate is misleading because it includes people not actively seeking jobs.

Putting this all together, the summary should highlight Trump's shift on immigration, his efforts to gain minority votes, the inaccuracies in his crime and unemployment claims, and the overall strategy to appeal to non-white voters despite trailing in polls.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without getting bogged down in too much detail. I'll structure it by addressing each main topic: immigration stance, crime claims, unemployment statistics, and the overall campaign strategy.

Let me draft that now.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, suggesting a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants without amnesty, after meeting with Hispanic and African American activists. This shift aims to court non-white voters, as polls show him trailing Hillary Clinton among these groups. Trump also claimed inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, a statement criticized for its inaccuracy, as crime rates have declined. He emphasized employing many African Americans, though few are in top roles in his organizations. Trump cited a 58% unemployment rate among young African Americans, a figure disputed as misleading, as it includes non-job seekers. His campaign strategy includes addressing minority issues to broaden support, despite trailing in polls. END OF SUMMARY.
