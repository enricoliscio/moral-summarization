SUMMARY:
This week, Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, the signature issue of his campaign, telling Sean Hannity that undocumented immigrants "will pay back taxes, there's no amnesty, but we will work with them." This softening of his previously hardline position comes as he tries to court the non-white vote, particularly African American and Latino voters. Trump has claimed that US inner cities, run by Democrats, are war zones with high crime rates and that his policies would improve the suffering and hurting African American communities. However, his statements have been offensive to the very voters he is trying to reach, and his claims about crime rates and black unemployment have been misleading and false. Trump's campaign has struggled to justify its use of statistics, and he has been accused of presenting a bleak and inaccurate picture of inner cities as crime-ridden war zones. Trump's softening on immigration and attempts to moderate his stance on certain issues suggest a shift in strategy as he tries to appeal to a wider range of voters. 

END OF SUMMARY.
