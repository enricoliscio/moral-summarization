Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Donald Trump's campaign, focusing on his changing stance on immigration, his claims about crime rates, and unemployment in African American communities. They also listed specific morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. Trump softened his immigration stance, which was a key part of his campaign. He talked about African American unemployment to court non-white voters. The article also mentions his claims about crime rates in inner cities being worse than war zones, which is factually inaccurate. Additionally, he cited high unemployment rates, but the statistics were misleading.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "lies," "pay," "stance," "remove," "rounding," "legalized," "moderation," "failed," "hurting," "failure," "poverty," "rejection," "education," "housing," "homes," "ownership," "crime," "safer," "run," "employ," "portrait," "offensive," "levels," "picture," "decline," "speeches," "suffering," "control," "unemployed," "get," "misleading" are key here.

I should structure the summary to include these words while keeping it concise, around 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump softening his immigration stance, using "moderation" and "stance." Then, discuss his claims about inner cities being unsafe, using "failed," "hurting," "crime," "safer," and "run." Include the part about African American unemployment, using "unemployed," "control," "suffering," and "misleading." Finally, touch on the criticism regarding his misleading statistics.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral framing without being too verbose. I'll also make sure to mention the context of him trying to court non-white voters and the statistical inaccuracies in his claims.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight Trump's changes in policy, his rhetoric about urban issues, the unemployment statistics, and the criticism he received for misleading information. This way, it preserves the moral framing while being concise.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, while attempting to court non-white voters. He claimed undocumented immigrants would "pay back taxes" and "work with them," though he denied amnesty. This moderation came amid criticism of his earlier hardline proposals, such as a "deportation force." Trump also criticized inner cities, claiming they are "safer in war zones," and accused Democrats of "failure" in addressing poverty, crime, and education. He emphasized African American unemployment, citing a misleading 58% rate, while his campaign struggled to gain support among non-white voters. Trump's claims about crime levels and employment statistics were widely criticized as inaccurate and "misleading." His rhetoric, though intended to appeal to African American and Latino communities, was seen as "offensive" and factually flawed. END OF SUMMARY.
