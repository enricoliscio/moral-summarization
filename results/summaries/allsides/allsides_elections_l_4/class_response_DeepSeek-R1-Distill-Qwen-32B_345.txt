Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should include as many as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to identify key points. The article talks about Trump softening his stance on immigration, his claims about inner city safety, and unemployment statistics. It also mentions the moral terms like "lies," "failed," "crime," and "misleading."

I should start by noting Trump's change in immigration policy, using terms like "softening," "deportation," and "amnesty." Then, mention his statements about inner cities being unsafe, using "failed," "hurting," and "crime-ridden." Finally, address the unemployment statistics, highlighting "misleading" and "suffering."

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too lengthy. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main point from the article while incorporating the specified terms.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's shifting stance on immigration, using morally framed terms like "lies," "deportation," and "amnesty," as he softened his hardline position to court non-white voters. Trump claimed immigrants would "pay back taxes" and work toward legalization, though he denied flip-flopping. His campaign also targeted African American unemployment, citing a misleading 58% unemployment rate among young blacks, a figure criticized as statistically flawed. Trump's rhetoric about inner cities being "safer than war zones" was deemed offensive and factually inaccurate, as crime rates have declined nationally. His claims of employing many African Americans were contradicted by reports showing few black executives in his organization. The article underscores Trump's use of morally charged language to frame issues, including "failed," "hurting," "crime-ridden," and "misleading," while highlighting his efforts to appeal to minority voters despite polling deficits. END OF SUMMARY.
