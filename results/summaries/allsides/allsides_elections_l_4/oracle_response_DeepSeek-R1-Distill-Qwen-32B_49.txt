Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Donald Trump's campaign, specifically his stance on immigration and his outreach to African American and Hispanic voters. The author uses words like "lies," "failed," "crime," and "misleading," so I should include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump softened his immigration stance, claiming immigrants would pay taxes and not get amnesty. He met with African American and Latino activists, trying to court their votes. The article mentions his claims about inner cities being unsafe, which is morally framed as a failure by Democrats. He also cited high unemployment rates among African Americans, using a misleading statistic.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words and the key points about his changing policies, the misleading claims, and the criticism of his outreach efforts. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to highlight the moral issues raised by the author.

I'll start by mentioning Trump softening his immigration stance, then his claims about inner cities and crime, followed by the misleading unemployment statistic. I'll conclude with the criticism of his outreach and the impact on his support among minority voters.

Let me draft that, making sure to include the moral terms and keep it within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump softened his immigration stance, claiming undocumented migrants would pay taxes and not receive amnesty, while denying a flip-flop. He met with African American and Latino activists, courting non-white voters amid trailing polls. Trump criticized inner cities as unsafe, blaming Democrats for poverty, crime, and poor education, despite crime statistics showing a long-term decline. He also claimed high African American unemployment rates, using a misleading statistic that included non-job seekers. Trump's outreach efforts, including speeches to mostly white audiences, have seen little support from African Americans. His claims and tactics have faced criticism for being offensive and statistically misleading, reflecting broader concerns about his campaign's moral framing. END OF SUMMARY.
