Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump's campaign, specifically his stance on immigration and his attempts to court non-white voters. The author uses words like "lies," "deportation," "failed," "crime," and "misleading" to frame the moral aspects.

I notice that Trump softened his immigration stance, which is a key point. He talked about African American unemployment, trying to appeal to minority voters. The article also mentions his claims about inner cities being unsafe, which the author finds offensive and misleading.

I should highlight Trump's contradictions, like his initial hardline on immigration versus his later softer approach. The part about the 58% unemployment rate is important because it's misleading, using data that includes people not seeking jobs.

I need to include the morally charged words: lies, undocumented, deported, failed, crime, safer, offensive, crime-ridden, suffering, unemployed, misleading. I'll make sure each of these is present in the summary without making it too wordy.

Putting it all together, the summary should cover Trump's shifting immigration policies, his outreach to minority groups, the misleading statistics, and the moral implications of his statements. I'll structure it to show how Trump's words and actions are framed negatively, emphasizing the lies, failures, and misleading claims.

I should keep each sentence concise, ensuring the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid adding any extra information not present in the article. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is included with the appropriate moral framing words.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, while attempting to court non-white voters. Despite his earlier promises of deportation and no amnesty, Trump now claims undocumented immigrants will pay back taxes and work toward legalization. Critics accuse him of flip-flopping and using misleading language to appeal to Hispanic and African American communities. Trump also claimed inner cities are "safer" than war zones, a statement seen as offensive and factually inaccurate, as crime rates have declined nationally. He further claimed 58% of young African Americans are unemployed, a figure later revealed to be misleading, as it included those not seeking employment. Trump's outreach to minority voters has been criticized for its insensitivity and lack of support, with polls showing he trails significantly among non-white voters. His campaign's moral framing of "failure," "crime," and "suffering" has been met with skepticism, as his claims often contradict data and alienate the very communities he seeks to win. END OF SUMMARY.
