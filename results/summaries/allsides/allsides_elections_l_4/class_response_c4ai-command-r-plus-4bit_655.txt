SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign has been marred by numerous lies and misleading statements this week, particularly on the issue of immigration. Trump, who initially proposed building a wall along the US-Mexico border and deporting undocumented immigrants, now appears to be softening his stance. He denies "flip-flopping" and proposes a path forward for immigrants to pay back taxes without amnesty. Regarding inner cities, Trump makes the offensive and misleading claim that they are more dangerous than war zones in countries the US is fighting in. He also manipulates unemployment statistics, claiming that 58% of African American youth are unemployed, which is not accurate according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Trump's campaign is struggling to court Hispanic and African American voters, with polls showing a significant lead for Hillary Clinton among non-white voters.
END OF SUMMARY.
