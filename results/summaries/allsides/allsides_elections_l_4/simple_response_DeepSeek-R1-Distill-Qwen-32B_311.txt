Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's recent actions and statements. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. So, I should focus on the ethical implications and criticisms mentioned.

First, the article talks about Trump softening his stance on immigration, which was a key part of his campaign. He's trying to appeal to Hispanic and African American voters, but his statements have been inconsistent. The original text points out that his claims about crime rates are misleading, as crime has actually been declining. That's a moral issue because he's using false information to make a point.

Next, he claims to employ many African Americans, but evidence shows few are in top positions. This is another ethical problem because it's deceptive. Also, his claim about 58% unemployment among young African Americans is misleading because it includes people not in the labor force, making the statistic inaccurate.

I need to make sure the summary highlights these moral criticisms without going into too much detail. I'll mention the softening on immigration, the misleading crime claims, the false employment claims, and the misleading unemployment statistics. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to reflect the original's critical tone.

I should start by stating that Trump softened his immigration stance to court minority voters. Then mention the inconsistent statements and the moral issues with his claims about crime and unemployment. Finally, note that his campaign is facing criticism for misleading claims, which undermines his credibility.

I think that covers the main points while preserving the moral framing. Let me put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue of his campaign, as he seeks to court Hispanic and African American voters. Despite his earlier hardline rhetoric, including promises of a "deportation force," Trump now appears to offer a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, though he denies flip-flopping. His statements on immigration have been inconsistent, with claims of "no amnesty" but a willingness to "work with" undocumented migrants. Trump has also criticized Democratic policies in urban areas, claiming inner cities are more dangerous than war zones, a claim that contradicts declining crime trends. His assertion that 58% of young African Americans are unemployed is misleading, as it includes those not seeking employment, inflating the figure. Trump's claims about crime and unemployment have been widely criticized for being factually inaccurate and politically motivated, raising ethical concerns about his messaging. END OF SUMMARY.
