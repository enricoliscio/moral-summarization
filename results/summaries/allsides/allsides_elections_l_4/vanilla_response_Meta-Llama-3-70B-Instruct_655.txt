SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a key issue in his campaign. After meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, Trump suggested that undocumented immigrants would not be deported, but would instead pay back taxes and work with the government. This shift in stance comes as Trump tries to court non-white voters, particularly African Americans and Hispanics. Trump has also made claims about African American unemployment, stating that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Trump has also made claims about crime in inner cities, stating that they are more dangerous than war zones. However, crime statistics show a steady decline since 1991.

END OF SUMMARY.
