SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a key campaign issue, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his claims have been met with skepticism, and his words have been deemed offensive and misleading. Trump's assertion that inner cities are more dangerous than war zones is a gross exaggeration, as crime rates have been declining for over a quarter of a century. His claim that 58% of African American youth are unemployed is also statistically misleading, as it includes individuals not seeking employment, such as students and retirees. Trump's outreach to African American voters has been met with little support, with only 1% of African American voters backing him in a recent poll. The moral framing of this article highlights Trump's dishonesty and lack of understanding of the issues affecting minority communities, revealing a pattern of deception and manipulation.

END OF SUMMARY.
