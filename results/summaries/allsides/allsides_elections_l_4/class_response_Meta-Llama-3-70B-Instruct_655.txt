SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his lies and contradictions have been exposed. Trump claimed that undocumented immigrants would "pay back taxes" and "work with them," but denied that he was "flip-flopping" on his previous promise to deport them. He also made offensive comments about African American communities, claiming they are "suffering" and "hurting" under Democratic control, with a misleading statistic that 58% of their youth are unemployed. In reality, the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Trump's rhetoric is filled with lies, manipulation, and failure to acknowledge the truth. He claims that war zones are safer than America's inner cities, which is a bleak and false portrait. His attempts to reach out to African American and Hispanic voters are insincere, and his words are often offensive and divisive.

END OF SUMMARY.
