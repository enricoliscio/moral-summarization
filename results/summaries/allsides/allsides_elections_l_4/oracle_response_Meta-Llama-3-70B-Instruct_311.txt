SUMMARY:

Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, in an attempt to court non-white voters. However, his lies and contradictory statements have raised eyebrows. He claims that undocumented immigrants will "pay back taxes" and that there's "no amnesty," but also offers a path forward, contradicting his previous promises of deportation. Trump's campaign has also been accused of using misleading statistics, such as the claim that 58% of young black men and women are unemployed, when in reality the unemployment rate is 25.7%. Trump's rhetoric is often offensive and perpetuates a bleak picture of America's inner cities, claiming they are more dangerous than war zones. His speeches, often delivered to largely white audiences, fail to address the real issues of poverty, rejection, and lack of education and housing in these communities. Trump's attempts to reach out to African American voters ring hollow, given his history of failed promises and misleading statements.

END OF SUMMARY.
