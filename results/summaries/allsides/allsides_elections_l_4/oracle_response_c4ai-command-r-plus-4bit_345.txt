SUMMARY: GOP nominee Donald Trump softened his stance on immigration, the signature issue of his campaign, while trying to court the non-white vote. In a town hall with Fox News, he denied that he was “flip-flopping,” claiming that immigrants would “pay back taxes” and “there’s no amnesty.” However, he contradicted his previous promises to deport undocumented migrants. Trump's attempts to moderate his stance on immigration come as he tries to appeal to Hispanic and African American voters, as polling shows him trailing Hillary Clinton by a significant margin among non-white voters. 

Trump also made misleading claims about the safety of inner cities, stating that war zones in countries where the US is fighting are safer than inner cities run by Democrats. He further asserted that crime is at record heights, which runs counter to a decades-long trend of declining crime. 

Additionally, Trump and his campaign repeated a misleading statistic about African American youth unemployment, claiming it to be at 58% when the actual seasonally adjusted rate for 16- to 19-year-old black Americans is 25.7%. Trump's outreach to African American voters has largely fallen flat, with a recent poll showing him receiving only 1% support from this demographic.
END OF SUMMARY.
