SUMMARY: Republican nominee Donald Trump has been caught lying to the American public about several issues, including immigration, the safety of inner cities, and African American unemployment. On immigration, Trump has softened his stance on deporting undocumented immigrants, contradicting his previous promises of a "deportation force." He now proposes a path forward for them to pay back taxes and gain legal status. Regarding inner cities, Trump falsely claims that they are more dangerous than war zones, ignoring the fact that crime has been declining for over 25 years. Trump also exaggerates the unemployment rate among young black Americans, stating it as 58% when the actual figure is around 25%. These misleading statements come as Trump tries to court the non-white vote, despite his history of offensive remarks and policies targeting these communities. Trump's campaign tactics are a disservice to the American public, who deserve honest and accurate information to make informed decisions.
END OF SUMMARY.
