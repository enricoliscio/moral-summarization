SUMMARY:
The recent anti-Semitic outbursts from celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler are a "troubling omen" for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement. The "muted response" to these incidents perpetuates "racism" and contributes to an overall "Apatholypse." The lack of outrage is "dehumanizing" and "illogic," implying that it's okay to discriminate against one group of people, which can lead to discrimination against others. The celebrities' "arrogant" and "irrational" responses to accusations of anti-Semitism only confirmed people's worst opinions. The "hate" and "prejudice" displayed by these individuals are a "threat" to social justice and highlight the importance of learning that "no one is free until everyone is free." END OF SUMMARY.
