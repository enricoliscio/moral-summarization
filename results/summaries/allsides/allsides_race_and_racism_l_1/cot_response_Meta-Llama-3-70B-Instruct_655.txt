SUMMARY:
The recent outbursts of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, are a troubling sign of the "Apatholypse" - a growing apathy towards social justice. The lack of massive indignation and passionate public outrage perpetuates racism and discrimination. These hateful outbursts, rooted in illogic and prejudice, contribute to a culture of dehumanizing characterization of entire groups of people. The muted response is a sign of apathy, which emboldens racists and hate groups. The author argues that if we're going to be outraged by injustice, we should be outraged by injustice against anyone, as "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." END OF SUMMARY.
