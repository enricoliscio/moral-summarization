Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about anti-Semitic statements from celebrities and the lack of strong response, which the author sees as contributing to a broader apathy towards social justice. I should highlight the key points: the celebrities involved, their statements, the muted response, and the impact on the Black Lives Matter movement. Also, the moral argument that silence perpetuates racism and the need for solidarity across all groups. I'll make sure to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the original tone about the importance of addressing all forms of injustice.

SUMMARY: The article addresses the recent surge in anti-Semitic remarks from prominent figures in sports and entertainment, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, and the lack of strong public condemnation. This muted response, termed "Apatholypse," perpetuates racism and undermines social justice efforts. The author highlights how anti-Semitic stereotypes, such as blaming Jews for oppression or global control, reflect a dangerous logic that scapegoats marginalized groups. The failure to address such prejudice not only harms Jewish communities but also threatens the progress of movements like Black Lives Matter. Celebrities, despite apologies, often fail to show genuine contrition, reinforcing the problem. The article emphasizes the interconnectedness of justice, quoting Martin Luther King Jr. and Billie Holidayâ€™s "Strange Fruit," to stress that injustice against one group threatens justice for all. The moral framing underscores the need for solidarity and accountability in combating all forms of discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
