Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about how some celebrities like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson made anti-Semitic comments, and others like Stephen Jackson and Chelsea Handler also got involved. The writer is upset because the response from the public and other celebrities wasn't strong enough, which they call "Apatholypse." 

They mention how this lack of outrage contributes to racism and social justice issues. The article also brings up the increase in hate crimes against Jews and ties it to the behavior of these public figures. It ends with a message about unity and fighting all forms of injustice.

I should focus on the main points: the celebrities' anti-Semitic comments, the muted response, the increase in hate crimes, and the call for solidarity against all injustices. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure to include all these elements concisely.
