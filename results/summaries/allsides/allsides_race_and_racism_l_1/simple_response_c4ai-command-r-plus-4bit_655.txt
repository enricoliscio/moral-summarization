SUMMARY: In a column for The Hollywood Reporter, the author expresses concern over the recent anti-Semitic statements made by celebrities and public figures, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, and Chelsea Handler. The muted response to these incidents, in contrast to the passionate outrage typically seen in the current social and political climate, is indicative of a dangerous apathy towards social justice issues. The author argues that discriminating against one group sets a precedent for discriminating against others and perpetuates racism. They highlight the illogical and destructive nature of anti-Semitic rhetoric and the responsibility of celebrities to use their influence responsibly. The article also mentions the increase in hate crimes against Jews and references Billie Holiday's song "Strange Fruit" as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of injustice. The column concludes with a call to recognize the mutuality of all forms of injustice and to stand against prejudice and discrimination in all its forms.
