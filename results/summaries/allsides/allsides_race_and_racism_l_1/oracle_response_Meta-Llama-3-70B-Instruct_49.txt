SUMMARY:

Recent incidents of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, are a troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement. The muted response to these hateful outbursts perpetuates racism and contributes to an overall "Apatholypse." The lack of indignation is shocking, especially given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world. The illogical and prejudiced statements made by these celebrities imply that it's okay to discriminate against one group of people, which can lead to discrimination against others. The apathy towards these incidents is disheartening, especially from those who have been violently marginalized. The arrogant and irrational responses to accusations of anti-Semitism only confirm people's worst opinions. It's essential to recognize that perpetuating this kind of bad logic is what perpetuates racism. We must be outraged by injustice against anyone and strive for justice and equality for all.
