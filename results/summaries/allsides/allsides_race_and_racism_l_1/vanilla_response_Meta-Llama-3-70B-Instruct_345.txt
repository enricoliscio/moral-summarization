SUMMARY:

A recent surge in anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, has sparked concern about the perpetuation of racism. The lack of widespread outrage and condemnation from the public and fellow celebrities is particularly troubling. The hateful outbursts, which included conspiracy theories and stereotypes, were met with a "shrug of meh-rage" rather than passionate public outrage. This apathy contributes to an "Apatholypse" where discrimination against one group is seen as acceptable and can lead to discrimination against others. The article argues that celebrities have a responsibility to promote social justice and that their words have real-world impact. It also highlights the importance of learning from history, citing the song "Strange Fruit" as an example of speaking out against injustice. The article concludes that outrage against injustice should be universal, regardless of the group being targeted.
