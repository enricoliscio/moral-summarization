Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, using as many of the listed morally framed words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses anti-Semitic outbursts by Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others in Hollywood and sports. The author criticizes the muted response, linking it to a "coming Apatholypse" and apathy towards social justice. There's a mention of how this lack of outrage contributes to racism and perpetuates injustice. The article also touches on the impact of these actions on the Black Lives Matter movement and the responsibility of celebrities to use their influence correctly.

I need to include key terms like "outbursts," "perpetuates," "racism," "apathy," "justice," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the incidents, the lack of public outrage, the implications for social justice, and the call for accountability.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the incidents, the muted response, the consequences, and ending with the call for unity and justice. I'll keep each sentence focused and concise to stay within the word limit.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary captures the moral stance against anti-Semitism and the need for solidarity in fighting all forms of injustice.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the troubling rise of anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson, which perpetuate racism and contribute to a "coming Apatholypse" of apathy toward social justice. The muted public response to these incidents, including tweets and posts, reflects a lack of indignation and perpetuates prejudice. The author argues that this apathy enables discrimination and undermines progress in the fight for justice. Celebrities, like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson, have made anti-Semitic statements, including blaming Jews for oppression and promoting conspiracy theories. Even apologies from some, like DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson, appeared insincere, failing to address the harm caused. The article emphasizes the destructive impact of such words, particularly when celebrities, who have a responsibility to use their platform wisely, fail to do so. The increase in anti-Semitic crimes and attacks underscores the urgency of addressing these issues. The author calls for unity and outrage against injustice, regardless of the group affected, echoing Martin Luther King Jr.'s message that "no one is free until everyone is free." END OF SUMMARY.
