SUMMARY:

The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others perpetuate racism and contribute to an overall "Apatholypse." The muted response to these hateful tweets and posts is disheartening and implies apathy towards social justice. The lack of indignation is shocking, especially given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world. These incidents are a troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement, as they perpetuate illogic and discrimination against one group of people, which can lead to the same treatment of others. The celebrities' responses, including apologies, have been arrogant and irrational, confirming people's worst opinions. The perpetuation of racism and prejudice is a threat to justice everywhere, and it's essential to recognize that no one is free until everyone is free. We must act with outrage towards injustice against anyone.

END OF SUMMARY.
