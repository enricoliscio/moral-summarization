SUMMARY:

The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others are a disturbing sign of the "Apatholypse" - a growing apathy towards social justice. The muted response to these incidents perpetuates racism and contributes to a culture of discrimination. The author argues that when we fail to condemn prejudice against one group, we create a slippery slope where discrimination against others becomes acceptable. The apologies from some of the offenders have been half-hearted and insincere, revealing a lack of understanding of the harm caused by their words. The author emphasizes that we must learn from history and recognize that injustice against anyone is a threat to justice everywhere. We must be outraged by injustice against anyone, not just when it affects our own group. The "Apatholypse" is a warning sign that we must take seriously and act against.
