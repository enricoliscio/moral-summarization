SUMMARY:

A recent surge in anti-Semitic tweets and posts from celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler has sparked concern about the future of the Black Lives Matter movement. The lack of widespread outrage and condemnation from the entertainment and sports industries is particularly troubling. These incidents perpetuate racism and contribute to an "Apatholypse" where social justice is ignored. The celebrities' responses, including apologies and denials, have been inadequate and have emboldened racists. The incidents have also highlighted a disturbing trend of scapegoating and prejudice, which is reminiscent of oppressive groups like the Nazis and KKK. The author argues that true social justice requires outrage and condemnation of all forms of discrimination, not just those that affect one's own group. Until then, racism and prejudice will continue to thrive.
