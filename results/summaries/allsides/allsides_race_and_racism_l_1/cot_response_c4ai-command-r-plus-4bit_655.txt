SUMMARY: The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities in sports and entertainment have sparked moral outrage, yet the muted response from the public and the celebrities themselves is troubling. The author condemns the scapegoating logic used by these individuals, perpetuating racism and prejudice. The article highlights the destructive impact of such actions, with a rise in hate crimes against Jews. Celebrities have a responsibility to choose their words carefully, as their influence can cause real harm. The article draws parallels with Billie Holiday's song "Strange Fruit," which faced resistance for its graphic lyrics about lynching but ultimately became a powerful anthem in the struggle against racism. The lesson remains that injustice against anyone should be met with outrage, and no one is truly free until everyone is free. The silence in the face of anti-Semitism perpetuates racism and threatens the progress made by the Black Lives Matter movement.
END OF SUMMARY.
