SUMMARY:

The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others have sparked concern about the apathy towards social justice. The lack of massive indignation perpetuates racism and contributes to an "Apatholypse" where discrimination against one group is seen as acceptable. These hateful statements, which imply that Jews are responsible for the oppression of blacks, are illogical and dehumanizing. Even former NBA player Stephen Jackson, a self-proclaimed activist, agreed with DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic messages, undoing his previous advocacy. The article argues that this kind of prejudice is what perpetuates racism, and that people from marginalized groups should not perpetuate the same harmful logic against others. The author calls for outrage against injustice towards anyone, citing Martin Luther King Jr.'s words that "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
