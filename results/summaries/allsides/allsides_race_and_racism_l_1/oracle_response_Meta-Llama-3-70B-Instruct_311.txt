SUMMARY:

The recent outbursts of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, perpetuate racism and contribute to an overall "Apatholypse." The muted response to these incidents is disheartening and implies apathy towards social justice. The lack of indignation is shocking, especially given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world. The celebrities' responses, including Ice Cube's remorseless defense of his tweets, are arrogant and irrational, confirming people's worst opinions. The apologies offered are insincere and lack true contrition. The perpetuation of prejudice and discrimination against one group of people can lead to the same against others. It's essential to recognize that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We must be outraged by injustice against anyone and work towards a world where everyone is free. END OF SUMMARY.
