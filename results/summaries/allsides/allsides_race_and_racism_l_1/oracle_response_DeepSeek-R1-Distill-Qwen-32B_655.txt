Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I keep the moral framing the author used. The article talks about anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson, and how the lack of strong reactions is contributing to apathy and racism. The author uses a lot of morally charged words, so I need to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article again to get the main points. It mentions how Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson made anti-Semitic tweets and posts, implying Jews are responsible for black oppression. The author is upset that there wasn't enough public outrage, leading to an "apatholypse," which means people are becoming apathetic towards social justice. This lack of response perpetuates racism because if one group is targeted, others might be too.

Celebrities like Stephen Jackson and Chelsea Handler also contributed by supporting anti-Semitic views, which the author sees as undoing their previous advocacy. The article mentions how these actions have a real impact, like the increase in hate crimes against Jews. It references historical examples, like Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit," to stress that injustice against any group affects everyone.

I need to make sure I include words like "outbursts," "perpetuates," "racism," "apatholypse," "tweets," "posts," "indignation," "prejudice," "apathy," "justice," "discriminate," "implied," "messages," "extort," "domination," "undid," "advocacy," "agreeing," "support," "characterization," "abuses," "killed," "posted," "exploiting," "rig," "pandering," "emboldened," "attack," "disheartening," "marginalized," "perpetuating," "marinate," "contrition," "impact," "crimes," "triple," "murdered," "wounding," "struggle," "lynching," "suppress," "injustice," "outraged."

I should structure the summary to highlight the celebrities' actions, the muted response, the consequences, and the call for unity against all forms of injustice. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure it flows well while preserving the moral tone.

The piece calls for unity against injustice, referencing Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" and Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings, emphasizing that no one is free until everyone is free. The lack of contrition from those involved, like Ice Cube, underscores the need for outrage against injustice against all groups. END OF SUMMARY.
