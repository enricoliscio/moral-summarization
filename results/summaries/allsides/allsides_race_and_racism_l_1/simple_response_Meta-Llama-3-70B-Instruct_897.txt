SUMMARY:

The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others have sparked a concerning lack of outrage, perpetuating racism and contributing to an "Apatholypse" where social justice is ignored. These incidents, including tweets and posts, have promoted harmful stereotypes and discrimination against Jews, with some even agreeing with or supporting notorious anti-Semites like Louis Farrakhan. The muted response is particularly disturbing given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world, where one would expect more passionate public outrage. The author argues that this apathy towards anti-Semitism sends a dangerous message that discrimination against any group is acceptable, and that it's essential to learn from the past that "no one is free until everyone is free." The lack of true contrition from those who have apologized only adds to the problem, and it's crucial to recognize that words have real impact and can perpetuate racism.
