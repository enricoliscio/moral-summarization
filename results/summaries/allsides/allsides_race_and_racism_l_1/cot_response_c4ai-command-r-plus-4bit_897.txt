SUMMARY: There has been a disturbing rise in anti-Semitic incidents involving celebrities from sports and entertainment, with a muted response from the public and little passionate outrage. This apathy towards social justice issues, dubbed the "Apatholypse," is troubling as it perpetuates racism and other forms of discrimination. Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others have made hateful comments and shared anti-Semitic imagery, scapegoating Jews for the oppression of blacks and promoting harmful stereotypes. While some have apologized, others remain defiant, with Ice Cube claiming he is "just pro-black." This "meh-rage" in response to sustained prejudice against Jews sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the Black Lives Matter movement. Celebrities have a responsibility to use their influence wisely and choose their words carefully, as the impact of their actions and statements can be destructive. The article emphasizes the interconnectedness of injustice and the need for mutual support in the fight against racism and discrimination. It calls for genuine outrage and action against injustice, regardless of who it affects.
