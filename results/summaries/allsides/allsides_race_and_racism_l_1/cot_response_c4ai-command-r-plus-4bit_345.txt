SUMMARY: The recent anti-Semitic outbursts from celebrities and public figures have sparked a muted response, revealing a troubling apathy toward social justice issues. Despite the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and sports, only meh-rage met sustained prejudice against Jews. Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others implied that Jews were responsible for black oppression, perpetuating racism with their scapegoat logic. Their arrogant and irrational responses to accusations of anti-Semitism confirmed people's worst opinions. The lack of indignation toward these incidents sends a subliminal message that discriminating against certain groups is acceptable. This illogic begets further illogic, perpetuating racism and other forms of injustice. While some have apologized, their words ring hollow, and the impact of their destructive deeds remains. This troubling trend underscores the need for genuine outrage against injustice, regardless of whom it affects. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
