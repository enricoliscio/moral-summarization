Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about anti-Semitic outbursts by some celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others. It mentions how their hateful tweets and posts are problematic, especially for the Black Lives Matter movement. The author is upset that there's not enough outrage from the public or other celebrities, which they call "apatholypse." 

They give examples like Ice Cube's tweets blaming Jews for black oppression, DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic messages, and Stephen Jackson supporting Farrakhan. Chelsea Handler, a Jewish performer, shared Farrakhan's content, which is concerning. Even Trump's campaign is criticized for anti-Semitic tropes. The article points out that these actions perpetuate racism because if one group is targeted, it can lead to others being targeted too. 

The celebrities' apologies aren't sincere, and their justifications are weak, like Ice Cube saying he's just pro-Black. The article references Billie Holiday's song "Strange Fruit" to highlight the ongoing fight against injustice and the need for solidarity. It ends with a call to action, emphasizing that injustice against anyone affects everyone.

So, the main points are: celebrities making anti-Semitic remarks, lack of public outrage, the impact on social justice movements, and the need for solidarity. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key incidents, the muted response, and the broader implications.
