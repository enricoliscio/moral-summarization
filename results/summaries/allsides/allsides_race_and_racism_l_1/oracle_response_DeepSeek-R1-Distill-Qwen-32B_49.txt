Okay, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses anti-Semitic outbursts by Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others in Hollywood and sports. It mentions how their tweets and posts implied Jews were responsible for black oppression. The author criticizes the lack of strong public outrage, calling it "apatholypse" and contributing to apathy towards social justice. The article also talks about the impact of these statements, including the spread of harmful messages and the normalization of anti-Semitism. It references historical events and the importance of solidarity in the fight against injustice.

I should include the key moral words like "outbursts," "perpetuates," "racism," "apathy," "tweets," "prejudice," "discriminate," "contrition," etc. I need to make sure the summary flows well, highlighting the main issues: the celebrities' anti-Semitic remarks, the muted response, the implications for social justice, and the call for solidarity.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the celebrities and their outbursts, then the lack of indignation, the normalization of prejudice, and the consequences. I'll also touch on the historical context with the song "Strange Fruit" and the call for unity against injustice.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within 200 words and includes the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson, whose tweets and posts implied Jews were responsible for black oppression. The muted response to these incidents perpetuates racism and contributes to an "apatholypse," a growing apathy toward social justice. The lack of massive indignation, despite the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and sports, is disheartening. These statements, including DeSean Jackson's claim that Jews aim for "world domination," and Stephen Jackson's support for anti-Semitic figures like Louis Farrakhan, undid their previous advocacy and spread harmful messages. Even apologies from some celebrities lacked contrition, with Ice Cube defending his "truth" and Stephen Jackson dismissing criticism. The article notes a rise in anti-Semitic crimes and warns that scapegoating logic, shared by oppressive groups, undermines progress. It calls for solidarity, emphasizing that injustice against one group threatens justice for all, as highlighted by Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" and Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings. The moral imperative is to be outraged by injustice against anyone, ensuring no one is free until everyone is free. END OF SUMMARY.
