SUMMARY: There has been a disturbing rise in anti-Semitic statements and sentiments expressed by celebrities and public figures, with a concerning lack of indignation in response. This apathy towards prejudice and injustice, dubbed the "Apatholypse," undermines the Black Lives Matter movement and perpetuates racism. Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Chelsea Handler, and even President Trump's reelection campaign have all made anti-Semitic comments or exploited anti-Jewish biases. These incidents reveal a dangerous scapegoat logic that targets specific groups as the source of all troubles. While some have apologized, others remain defiant and remorseless, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contributing to a rise in hate crimes against Jews. The article emphasizes the interconnectedness of all forms of injustice and calls for a united stand against prejudice and discrimination in all its forms. It urges us to learn from history and recognize that no one is truly free until everyone is free. END OF SUMMARY.
