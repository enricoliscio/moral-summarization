SUMMARY: Recent anti-Semitic statements by celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, have sparked outrage and raised concerns about the state of social justice. While some have apologized, others remain defiant in the face of accusations, perpetuating racism and contributing to a growing apathy towards social justice issues. The muted response to these incidents suggests a double standard and a selective indignation that undermines the Black Lives Matter movement. The author emphasizes the interconnectedness of injustice and calls for a consistent stance against discrimination, regardless of the targeted group. The article concludes with a reminder of Martin Luther King Jr.'s words on mutuality and the importance of recognizing that no one is free until everyone is free.
