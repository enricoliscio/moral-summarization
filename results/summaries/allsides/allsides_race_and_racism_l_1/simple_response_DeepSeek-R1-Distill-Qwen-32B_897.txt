Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about anti-Semitic outbursts by Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others in Hollywood and sports. It mentions how their tweets and posts have been problematic, and the lack of strong public response from others is contributing to a problem called "Apatholypse." The author is concerned that this apathy towards social justice issues could lead to more racism and discrimination.

The article gives examples of specific incidents, like Ice Cube's tweets blaming Jews for black oppression, DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic messages, and Chelsea Handler sharing Farrakhan's content. It also mentions the Trump campaign's use of anti-Semitic tropes. The author points out that these actions and the muted responses perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to a cycle of prejudice.

The moral argument here is that silence in the face of discrimination allows it to spread and affects everyone, not just one group. The author references Martin Luther King Jr.'s idea that injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere, emphasizing the interconnectedness of social justice issues.

I need to summarize this, keeping the moral angle intact. The key points are the anti-Semitic incidents, the lack of outrage, how this contributes to apathy and racism, and the moral lesson about unity against injustice.

I should structure the summary to highlight the incidents, the muted response, the impact on social justice, and the call for solidarity. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically from one point to the next.
