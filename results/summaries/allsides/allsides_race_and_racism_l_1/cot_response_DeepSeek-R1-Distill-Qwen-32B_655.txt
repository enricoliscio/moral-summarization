Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, focusing on the moral framing. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. They mentioned "STEP 1:" and to list each word with a * at the beginning. Looking at the article, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "hateful," "apathy," "prejudice," "discriminate," "scapegoat," "oppression," "racism," "prejudice," "anti-Semitic," "marginalized," "dehumanizing," "prejudice," "apologized," "contrition," "belligerent," "good intentions," "deeds," "impact," "hate crimes," "lynching," "Strange Fruit," "oppression," "injustice," "network of mutuality," "outraged," "injustice." I think those are the key morally charged words.

Next, the user wants a summary that preserves these moral framings. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those words as possible. I'll need to structure the summary to highlight the main points: the anti-Semitic comments by celebrities, the muted response, the impact on social justice movements, the rise in hate crimes, and the call for solidarity against all forms of injustice.

I should start by mentioning the celebrities and their comments, then the lack of strong reactions, which perpetuates apathy. Then, touch on the increase in hate crimes and the importance of solidarity, referencing the song "Strange Fruit" and Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote to emphasize the moral stance.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too wordy. Let me draft it, ensuring I include the morally framed words and keep it within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article highlights the troubling rise of anti-Semitic comments from celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, as well as the lack of strong public condemnation, which perpetuates apathy and racism. These statements, including conspiracy theories and harmful stereotypes, dehumanize Jews and undermine social justice efforts. The muted response from the public and even some Jewish figures further normalizes prejudice, contributing to the "Apatholypse." The article also notes the increase in hate crimes against Jews and the destructive impact of such rhetoric. It calls for solidarity against all forms of injustice, emphasizing that no one is free until everyone is free, as highlighted by Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings. The moral imperative is to act with outrage against injustice, regardless of the group affected. END OF SUMMARY.
