SUMMARY:

The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others have perpetuated racism and contributed to an overall "Apatholypse." The lack of massive indignation is shocking, especially given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world. The tweets and posts implied that Jews were responsible for the oppression of blacks, and the responses were marked by apathy and prejudice. The illogic of discriminating against one group of people without pushback implies that it's okay to do the same to others. The statements were dehumanizing and perpetuated harmful stereotypes, which can lead to police abuses and violence. The apologies were half-hearted and lacked true contrition, and the impact of these words has been destructive. The lesson remains that no one is free until everyone is free, and we must be outraged by injustice against anyone.

END OF SUMMARY.
