Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. They provided the article, which is about anti-Semitic outbursts from several celebrities and the muted response to it. The user wants the summary to be concise, no more than 200 words, and to include specific tokens at the beginning and end.

First, I need to read through the article carefully. It mentions Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others making anti-Semitic comments. The columnist is pointing out that the lack of strong public reaction is perpetuating racism and contributing to a sense of apathy towards social justice issues.

I should identify the main points: the celebrities' statements, the lack of outrage, the columnist's concern about the "Apatholypse," and the examples given, including the Trump campaign's criticism. Also, the article references historical data on hate crimes against Jews and uses Billie Holiday's song as a metaphor for the need to address injustice universally.

I need to condense this into a summary that's under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the celebrities and their anti-Semitic remarks. Then, note the muted response and its implications. Include the columnist's argument about apathy leading to more racism. Mention the examples like the Trump campaign and the celebrities' apologies. Finally, reference the increase in hate crimes and the call for solidarity against all forms of injustice.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without getting too detailed. Also, keep the language clear and concise to stay within the word limit. I'll structure it to first present the issue, then the response, and conclude with the broader implications and call to action.

SUMMARY: The article discusses recent anti-Semitic remarks made by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others, highlighting the troubling lack of outrage from the public and the entertainment industry. The columnist argues that this muted response perpetuates racism and contributes to a growing "Apatholypse," where apathy toward social justice becomes normalized. Notable incidents include Ice Cube's tweets blaming Jews for black oppression, DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic messages, and Chelsea Handler's promotion of anti-Semitic content. The article also critiques President Trump's campaign for exploiting anti-Jewish tropes, despite having Jewish family members. Celebrities' apologies, such as those from DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson, are seen as insincere, failing to address the harm caused. The columnist emphasizes that injustice against one group threatens justice for all, citing the rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes and urging solidarity against prejudice. END OF SUMMARY.
