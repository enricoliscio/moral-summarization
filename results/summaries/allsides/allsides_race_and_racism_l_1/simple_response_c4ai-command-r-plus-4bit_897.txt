SUMMARY: A recent wave of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from celebrities in sports and entertainment has sparked concern over the lack of significant outrage, indicating a dangerous level of apathy toward social justice issues. Figures like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, and Chelsea Handler have made offensive statements or shared anti-Semitic content, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contributing to a broader problem of racism and discrimination. This behavior undermines the Black Lives Matter movement and the fight against injustice. The muted response to these incidents suggests a double standard and a selective approach to social justice, sending a message that discrimination against certain groups is acceptable. This "Apatholypse," as the columnist calls it, threatens the progress made toward equality and mutual understanding. The article emphasizes the need for consistent outrage against all forms of injustice, quoting Martin Luther King Jr.'s words on the interconnectedness of justice. It calls for genuine contrition from those who spread anti-Semitic messages and for society to recognize the harmful impact of perpetuating racist logic.
END OF SUMMARY.
