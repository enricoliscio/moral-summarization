SUMMARY:
Recent incidents of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, are a troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement. The muted response to these hateful outbursts perpetuates racism and contributes to an overall "Apatholypse." The lack of massive indignation is shocking, especially given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world. The illogic of discriminating against one group of people without pushback implies it's OK to do the same to others. This dehumanizing characterization of a people causes police abuses and perpetuates racism. It's disheartening to see people from marginalized groups do the same thing to others without realizing that perpetuating this kind of bad logic is what perpetuates racism. END OF SUMMARY.
