Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the provided morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It discusses anti-Semitic outbursts by several celebrities, the muted response, and how this contributes to apathy and racism. The author is concerned about the impact on social justice movements.

I should start by identifying key events: Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others making anti-Semitic tweets. The muted response from the public and other celebrities is a problem. The article mentions the term "apatholypse," which is important. I need to include words like "outbursts," "perpetuates," "racism," and "apathy."

Next, I'll note the celebrities involved and their statements. The article also touches on the increase in hate crimes against Jews and the historical context with Billie Holiday's song. This shows the ongoing struggle against injustice.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral framing words. I'll structure it by first mentioning the outbursts, then the muted response, the celebrities' apologies, and the broader implications. I'll end with the call for unity against injustice.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the key moral terms and maintain the author's concern about the impact on social justice. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, which perpetuate racism and contribute to an "Apatholypse" of social justice apathy. These tweets and posts, which imply Jewish responsibility for black oppression and promote anti-Semitic stereotypes, were met with a lack of indignation, despite the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and sports. The muted response normalizes prejudice, emboldening racists and pandering to hate groups. Celebrities, including former NBA player Stephen Jackson, furthered this harm by agreeing with anti-Semitic statements, while apologies from some, like DeSean Jackson, were seen as insincere. The article notes the alarming rise in anti-Semitic crimes and connects these incidents to broader systemic injustices, emphasizing that no one is free until everyone is free. It calls for outrage against injustice against all people, echoing Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of mutuality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
