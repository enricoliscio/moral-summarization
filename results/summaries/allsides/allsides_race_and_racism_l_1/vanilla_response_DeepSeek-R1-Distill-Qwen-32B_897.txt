Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about several celebrities making anti-Semitic comments, like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler. It mentions how their statements have been problematic and how the lack of strong public outrage from others is concerning. The author points out that this apathy contributes to a broader issue of social justice apathy, which they call the "Apatholypse." 

They also discuss how these celebrities, who are supposed to be advocates for justice, are instead perpetuating harmful stereotypes. For example, Ice Cube's tweets implied Jews were responsible for black oppression, and DeSean Jackson tweeted anti-Semitic messages. Even some apologies from these figures seem insincere, which makes the situation worse. 

The article also touches on the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes and connects it to the lack of accountability. It references historical examples, like Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit," to emphasize the importance of standing against all forms of injustice. The main message is that social justice can't be selective; it has to include everyone, and allowing prejudice against one group affects the fight for justice for all.

So, the summary should cover the celebrities involved, the nature of their comments, the muted response, the impact on social justice, and the broader message about solidarity. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the key points without getting too detailed.

The muted response from the public and other celebrities, despite their progressive stances, signals a broader disengagement from combating injustice. The article emphasizes that social justice cannot be selective, as allowing discrimination against one group undermines efforts to fight racism and inequality for all. It concludes by urging solidarity and accountability, referencing historical examples like Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit," to stress the importance of addressing all forms of injustice.
