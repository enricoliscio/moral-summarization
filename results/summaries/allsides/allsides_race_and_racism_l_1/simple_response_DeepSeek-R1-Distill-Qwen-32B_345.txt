Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses anti-Semitic outbursts by several celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler. It highlights the lack of strong public response from the entertainment and sports industries, which the author argues contributes to a broader apathy towards social justice, termed "Apatholypse." The article connects this to the Black Lives Matter movement, suggesting that such indifference can lead to further injustices. It also mentions the rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes and references historical examples like Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" to emphasize the importance of solidarity against all forms of discrimination.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I should ensure that the moral message about the interconnectedness of social justice issues is clearly conveyed. I'll focus on the key incidents, the muted response, the impact on social justice movements, and the call for solidarity.

I should structure the summary to first mention the celebrities' actions, then the lack of outrage, the consequences, and end with the moral lesson. I'll avoid getting too detailed on each incident to keep it within the word limit.

Let me draft this, making sure to include the essential elements and maintain the original's moral perspective.
