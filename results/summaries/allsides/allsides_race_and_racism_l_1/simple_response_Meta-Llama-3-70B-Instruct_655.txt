SUMMARY:

The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others are a disturbing sign of the "Apatholypse" - a growing apathy towards social justice. The lack of widespread outrage is perpetuating racism, as it implies that discrimination against one group is acceptable. The hateful tweets and posts are not only morally reprehensible but also illogical, as they blame Jews for the oppression of blacks. The responses from these celebrities, including apologies, have been inadequate and even arrogant, confirming people's worst opinions. The author argues that this kind of scapegoat logic is what perpetuates racism and that no one is free until everyone is free. The lesson from Martin Luther King Jr. remains: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." We must be outraged by injustice against anyone, not just select groups.
