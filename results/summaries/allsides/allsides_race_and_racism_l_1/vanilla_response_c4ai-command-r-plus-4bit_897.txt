SUMMARY: The recent anti-Semitic statements and actions by several celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, have sparked concerns about the state of the Black Lives Matter movement and the overall apathy towards social justice issues. The muted response to these incidents, compared to the passionate outrage typically seen in Hollywood and the sports world, suggests a double standard and contributes to a broader problem of apathy towards all forms of social justice. The article argues that perpetuating discriminatory logic against any group perpetuates racism and that celebrities have a responsibility to choose their words carefully. It highlights the increase in hate crimes against Jews and the deadly shooting at a synagogue in San Diego in 2019. The writer concludes by emphasizing the interconnectedness of justice and the need to condemn injustice against anyone.
