SUMMARY:

A recent surge in anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, has sparked concern about the perpetuation of racism. The lack of widespread outrage and condemnation from the public and celebrities alike is seen as a sign of "apathy to all forms of social justice." The article argues that the hateful outbursts against Jews contribute to a broader "Apatholypse" where discrimination against one group is seen as acceptable, paving the way for discrimination against others. The article criticizes the celebrities' responses, including apologies that come across as insincere and attempts to justify their actions. The author emphasizes the importance of standing up against injustice, citing Martin Luther King Jr.'s words that "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
