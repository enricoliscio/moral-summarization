SUMMARY: Recent anti-Semitic tweets and posts from celebrities in sports and entertainment have sparked concern over the lack of indignation and passionate public outrage. This apathy towards prejudice and injustice perpetuates racism and contributes to what the author calls an "Apatholypse." Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, and Chelsea Handler have all made anti-Semitic statements or shared messages from notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. While some have apologized, others remain defiant and remorseless in their response to accusations of anti-Semitism. The article argues that such scapegoating logic is oppressive and marginalizes groups that have faced violence and discrimination. It highlights the rise in hate crimes against Jews and the impact of destructive words and actions. The song "Strange Fruit," written by a Jewish teacher and performed by Billie Holiday, serves as a powerful reminder of the struggle against racism and the need for mutual justice. The author calls for outrage against injustice towards anyone, regardless of their identity.
