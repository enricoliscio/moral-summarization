Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about anti-Semitic tweets and posts from Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others. It mentions how their hateful outbursts have been met with a muted response, which the author argues perpetuates racism and contributes to an "Apatholypse." 

I should note the key points: celebrities making anti-Semitic remarks, the lack of strong public outrage, examples of specific tweets and apologies, and the impact on social justice movements. The article also connects this to the Black Lives Matter movement and the importance of solidarity against all forms of discrimination.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the celebrities involved and their anti-Semitic comments. Then, I'll highlight the muted response and its implications. I'll include specific examples like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson, and mention the apologies that weren't sincere. Finally, I'll touch on the broader message about solidarity and the consequences of not addressing these issues.

I should make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step: introduction of the issue, examples, response from the public and celebrities, and the conclusion about the importance of unity against all injustices.
