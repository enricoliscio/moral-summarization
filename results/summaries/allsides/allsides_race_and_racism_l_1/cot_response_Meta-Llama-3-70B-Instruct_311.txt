SUMMARY:
The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others are a troubling sign of the "Apatholypse" - a lack of outrage against prejudice and discrimination. Their hateful and illogical tweets and posts perpetuate racism and contribute to a culture of apathy. The muted response to these incidents is shocking, especially from those who claim to be advocates for social justice. The dehumanizing characterization of Jews and other groups is a slippery slope that leads to further oppression and violence. It's impossible to take these celebrities seriously when they post anti-Semitic imagery and then apologize with arrogance and irrationality. We must learn that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and that no one is free until everyone is free. END OF SUMMARY.
