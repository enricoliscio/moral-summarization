Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about anti-Semitic outbursts by some celebrities and the lack of a strong response, which the author sees as contributing to a decline in social justice efforts, especially concerning the Black Lives Matter movement. 

First, I should identify the main points. The article mentions Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others making anti-Semitic comments. It also talks about the muted response from the public and other celebrities, which the author calls "apatholypse." The author is concerned that this lack of outrage enables further prejudice and undermines social justice.

I need to make sure the summary includes these key elements: the celebrities involved, the nature of their comments, the muted response, the impact on social justice, and the author's call for solidarity against all forms of discrimination. I should also mention the reference to the song "Strange Fruit" and Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote to emphasize the moral message.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the author's concern about the normalization of prejudice and the importance of unified action against injustice. I'll need to structure it so that each sentence flows logically, connecting the events to the broader implications on social justice movements.

Let me try to outline the summary: Start with the celebrities' anti-Semitic remarks, mention the lack of strong public reaction, explain how this contributes to apathy, discuss the impact on Black Lives Matter, reference the song and MLK's quote, and conclude with the call for unity against all forms of discrimination.

I should also watch the word count to stay within the limit. Maybe combine some points to make it more concise. For example, instead of listing each celebrity's specific comments, just mention that they made anti-Semitic remarks and that some apologized insincerely.

I think that's a good plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it captures all the essential points and maintains the moral tone.

SUMMARY: The article highlights anti-Semitic remarks made by celebrities like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson, criticizing the lack of strong public outrage, which the author argues perpetuates racism and undermines the Black Lives Matter movement. This muted response, termed "apatholypse," reflects a broader decline in social justice engagement. The author emphasizes that condoning prejudice against one group justifies it against others, citing examples like Chelsea Handler and Stephen Jackson's apologies, which lacked sincerity. The piece references Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" and Martin Luther King Jr.'s call for unity, stressing that injustice against any group threatens justice for all. The moral imperative is for solidarity and outrage against all forms of discrimination to uphold true social justice. END OF SUMMARY.
