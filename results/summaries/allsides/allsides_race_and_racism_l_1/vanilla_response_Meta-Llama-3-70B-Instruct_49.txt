SUMMARY:

A recent surge in anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities, including Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, has sparked concern about the perpetuation of racism. The lack of widespread outrage and condemnation of these hateful outbursts has been particularly troubling. The columnist argues that this apathy contributes to a broader "Apatholypse" where social justice is ignored. The incidents highlight a disturbing trend of scapegoating and prejudice, which is often justified by celebrities and public figures. The columnist notes that even apologies from some of these individuals have been inadequate and insincere. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of standing against injustice and prejudice in all forms, citing the words of Martin Luther King Jr. that "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
