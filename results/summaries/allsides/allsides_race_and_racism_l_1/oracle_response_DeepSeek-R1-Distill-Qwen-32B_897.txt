Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants the summary to include as many of the specified morally framed words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses anti-Semitic outbursts by Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others in Hollywood and sports. It highlights the muted response from the public, which the author calls "apatholypse," meaning a lack of concern for social justice. The author is concerned that this apathy contributes to racism and perpetuates prejudice.

I should include words like "outbursts," "perpetuates," "racism," "apathy," "prejudice," etc. The article mentions specific incidents, such as tweets and posts from these celebrities, and how their statements imply anti-Semitic views. The lack of strong public indignation is a problem, leading to a cycle of injustice.

I need to mention the celebrities, their actions, the muted response, and the impact on social justice movements. Also, the article ties this to broader issues like hate crimes and the importance of solidarity against all forms of discrimination.

I should structure the summary to first state the issue, then the response, and the implications. Make sure to keep it under 200 words and include the key moral terms. I'll also need to end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include all the necessary elements and maintain the moral framing. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the troubling rise of anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler, which perpetuate racism and contribute to a culture of apathy toward social justice. These incidents, including tweets and posts with anti-Semitic messages, have been met with a lack of strong public indignation, signaling an "Apatholypse" where prejudice is tolerated. The author warns that this apathy emboldens racists and undermines the Black Lives Matter movement, as discrimination against one group justifies it for others. Celebrities, despite apologies, often fail to show genuine contrition, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. The article also critiques President Trump's campaign for exploiting anti-Semitic tropes, further perpetuating injustice. The moral lesson, drawn from Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit," is that no one is free until everyone is free, emphasizing the need for outrage against all forms of injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
