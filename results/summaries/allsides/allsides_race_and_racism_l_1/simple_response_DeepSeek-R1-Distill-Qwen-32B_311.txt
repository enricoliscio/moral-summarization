Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article discusses anti-Semitic statements by Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others, and the lack of strong response from the public and celebrities, which the author argues contributes to a "Apatholypse" and undermines social justice efforts.

First, I should identify the key points: the incidents involving the celebrities, their anti-Semitic tweets, the muted response, and the implications for social justice. The author is concerned that this apathy perpetuates racism and sets a dangerous precedent.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the celebrities and their anti-Semitic remarks. Then, note the lack of significant public outcry, which the author sees as contributing to apathy towards social justice. Highlight the comparison to historical injustices, like the song "Strange Fruit," to emphasize the importance of solidarity.

Make sure to include the moral message: that allowing prejudice against one group justifies it against others, and the need for unity in fighting injustice. Conclude by referencing the author's call for outrage against all forms of injustice.

I should structure it clearly, ensuring each point flows logically. Keep it concise but comprehensive, capturing the main arguments without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: The article addresses anti-Semitic remarks made by Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others, highlighting the troubling lack of public outrage and its implications for social justice. The author argues that this muted response perpetuates racism and contributes to a "Apatholypse," where apathy toward one group's oppression justifies it for others. Celebrities like Ice Cube and DeSean Jackson made anti-Semitic comments, including blaming Jews for black oppression and promoting conspiracy theories. Despite apologies, their responses were seen as insincere, with Ice Cube defending his "truth" and Stephen Jackson downplaying his words. The article draws parallels to historical injustices, such as Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit," emphasizing that injustice against one group threatens justice for all. The author calls for solidarity and outrage against all forms of prejudice, urging recognition that no one is free until everyone is free. END OF SUMMARY.
