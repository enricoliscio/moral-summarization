SUMMARY:

The recent anti-Semitic outbursts by celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and others are a disturbing sign of the "Apatholypse" - a growing apathy towards social justice. The muted response to these incidents perpetuates racism and contributes to a culture of discrimination. The author argues that if it's acceptable to discriminate against one group of people, it becomes acceptable to discriminate against others. The illogical and hateful statements made by these celebrities, including blaming Jews for the oppression of blacks and promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes, are particularly troubling given their influence and platform. The author calls out the hypocrisy of those who claim to advocate for social justice but remain silent or even perpetuate hate speech. The article concludes that true outrage and action are necessary to combat injustice, and that we must recognize that "no one is free until everyone is free."
