SUMMARY:

A recent surge in anti-Semitic tweets and posts from celebrities like Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson, and Chelsea Handler has sparked concern about the lack of outrage from the public and the entertainment industry. The author argues that this apathy perpetuates racism and contributes to an "Apatholypse" where social justice is ignored. The celebrities' statements, which included anti-Semitic tropes and stereotypes, were met with a muted response, with some even defending their actions. The author notes that this kind of prejudice is illogical and can lead to discrimination against other groups. The article also criticizes the half-hearted apologies from some of the celebrities, saying that true contrition is needed. The author concludes that everyone must be outraged by injustice against anyone, quoting Martin Luther King Jr.'s phrase "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
