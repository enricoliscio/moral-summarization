Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. So, first, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral perspectives presented.

The article is about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone, known as CHOP, which was established after George Floyd's death. The protest zone was initially peaceful but turned violent, leading to arrests and police intervention. The moral framing here is important—there are different perspectives on the protest, the violence, and the actions taken by the authorities.

I need to capture the main events: the protest zone's establishment, the violence that ensued, the police action, and the reactions from various parties like the mayor, the attorney general, and protesters. I should highlight the moral arguments on both sides—some seeing the protest as a necessary stand against police brutality, others viewing it as lawlessness that needed suppression.

I should also note the political implications, such as the Attorney General commending the police chief but not mentioning the mayor, who's a Democrat. This adds a layer of political tension. Additionally, the protesters' response and their determination to continue despite the crackdown shows the ongoing conflict.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential points without getting bogged down in details. I'll ensure that the moral aspects are clear, showing both the support for the protest as a stand against racial injustice and the criticism for the violence that occurred.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the protest's origins, moving through the violence and police action, and ending with the reactions and future implications. This should provide a balanced view that respects the moral framing the author intended.

SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, established after George Floyd's death, following weeks of violence and unrest. Police arrested 31 people, citing unlawful assembly and crimes, as the area had become lawless with shootings, robberies, and assaults. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best supported the action, while U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended the police for upholding the law. Protesters like Harry Hearns initially defended the zone but later blamed outsiders for violence. The zone, which began as a peaceful protest against racial injustice, had become less active before the crackdown. Businesses and attorneys pushed for stronger measures, and some protesters vowed to regroup. The incident highlights the tension between the right to protest and the need to maintain public safety, with critics arguing the zone had devolved into chaos. END OF SUMMARY.
