SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" in the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) area, arresting 31 people for various crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. The move was commended by U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who praised Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. Others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup and continue the movement, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." The CHOP zone was established in response to the killing of George Floyd and had become a symbol of the nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. The police operation was seen as a necessary step to restore order and prevent further violence.
