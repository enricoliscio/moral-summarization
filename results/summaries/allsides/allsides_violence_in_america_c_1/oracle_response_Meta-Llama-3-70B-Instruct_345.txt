SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" on Wednesday, arresting 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to a recent spate of shootings, deaths of two teenagers, and other violent crimes. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime in "restoring the rule of law." The zone, which was established in response to the killing of George Floyd, had become a hub for violence, with four shootings, robberies, assaults, and property crimes occurring in the area. Conservative pundits had pointed to the zone as evidence that protests across the country were not as peaceful as portrayed. The police operation to retake the zone was largely unresisted, with some officers even sipping Starbucks coffee during the operation. Despite the crackdown, protesters vowed to regroup, with one saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever."
