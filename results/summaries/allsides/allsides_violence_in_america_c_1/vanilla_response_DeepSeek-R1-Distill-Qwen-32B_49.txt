Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone called CHOP. They arrested 31 people for various crimes. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly because of recent shootings and deaths. The police chief, Carmen Best, criticized the zone as lawless and brutal. Trump called for action against demonstrators, and Barr supported Best. A protester, Rick Hearns, supported the police action, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone was set up after George Floyd's death, but it became less active recently. Businesses and attorneys are pushing for tougher measures. Protesters plan to regroup.

I should start the summary by mentioning the dismantling of the CHOP zone by Seattle authorities. Include the number of arrests, the reason for declaring it unlawful, the police chief's statement, Trump's involvement, and the support from Barr. Then mention the protester's perspective, the origin of the zone, its decline, and the future plans of the protesters. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.
