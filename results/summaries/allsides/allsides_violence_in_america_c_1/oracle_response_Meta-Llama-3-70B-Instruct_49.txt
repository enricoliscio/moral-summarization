SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled the "lawless and brutal" Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, arresting 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, condemned the zone, citing a recent spate of shootings, deaths of two teenagers, and other violent crimes. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime, "restoring the rule of law." Protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, blamed outsiders for the violence, saying they didn't represent violence. The CHOP zone, which was established after the killing of George Floyd, had become a hub of "unlawful assembly," with robberies, assaults, and property crimes. The police crackdown was met with little resistance, and businesses in the area had been pushing for a tougher stance. Despite the dismantling, protesters vowed to regroup, saying "you can't stop a revolution" and that "Black lives matter now and forever." END OF SUMMARY.
