SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, arresting 31 people for various crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. The move was commended by U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who distinguished between the right to protest and violent crime. Protester Harry "Rick" Hearns supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone had become less crowded and active in recent days, with businesses in the area pushing for a tougher stance by authorities. Despite the crackdown, protester Lencho Williams vowed that the movement would regroup, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." The dismantling of CHOP highlights the tension between the right to protest and the need to maintain law and order.
