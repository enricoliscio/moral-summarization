SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP) zone, arresting 31 people for various crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. Protesters had occupied the area for a month, demanding racial justice and police reform, but the zone had become less crowded and active in recent days. Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. Others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup and continue the movement. The city's mayor, Jenny Durkan, had declared the gathering an "unlawful assembly" prior to the police action.
