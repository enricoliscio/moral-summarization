Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Seattle authorities moved to dismantle a protest zone called the "autonomous zone." The police chief, Carmen Best, called it "lawless and brutal." President Trump had also called for action against demonstrators. The police, dressed in protective gear, arrested 31 people for various crimes. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly, and the police chief pointed out recent shootings and deaths of teenagers. Attorney General William Barr commended the police chief but didn't mention the mayor, who's a Democrat and a target of Trump's ire.

There's a protester, Rick Hearns, who supported the police action, blaming outsiders for the violence. The protest zone was established after George Floyd's death, leading to the CHOP zone. The area had become lawless with shootings and crimes, according to the police chief. Trump labeled the protesters as "domestic terrorists." The article mentions black armored vehicles and baton-wielding officers, as well as the area being barricaded with plywood signs. The operation met little resistance, and the zone was less crowded. Businesses and attorneys are pushing for tougher measures, and some protesters plan to regroup.

So, the main points are: Seattle authorities dismantling the protest zone, arrests made, the zone being declared unlawful, police action supported by Barr, protester's perspective, the origin of the zone after Floyd's death, the lawlessness leading to police intervention, Trump's comments, the operation's execution, and the future implications with lawsuits and plans to regroup.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll start with the key actors: Seattle authorities, police chief, Trump, and the protesters. Mention the reasons for dismantling, the arrests, the unlawful assembly declaration, support from Barr, the protester's viewpoint, the context of George Floyd, the lawlessness leading to intervention, Trump's labeling, the operation details, and the aftermath with lawsuits and plans to regroup.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the main events and outcomes without getting too detailed. Also, keep it concise, sticking to the word limit.
