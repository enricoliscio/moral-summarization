SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP) zone, which had been occupied by protesters for weeks. The police chief described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. Officers arrested 31 people for various crimes, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended the police chief for "restoring the rule of law." The zone had been established in response to the killing of George Floyd, and its occupation had triggered a nationwide wave of protests against racial injustice and police brutality. While some protesters blamed outsiders for the violence, others vowed to regroup and continue the movement, with one protester saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." The dismantling of the zone marks a turning point in the protests, with authorities seeking to reassert control over the area. END OF SUMMARY.
