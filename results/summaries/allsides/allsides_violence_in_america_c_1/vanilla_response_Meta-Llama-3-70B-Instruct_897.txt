SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP) zone on Wednesday, arresting 31 people for various crimes. The zone, which was established after the killing of George Floyd, had become "lawless and brutal" with four shootings, robberies, and assaults, according to Police Chief Carmen Best. The move came after Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan declared the gathering an "unlawful assembly". U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone had become less crowded and active in recent days, with businesses in the area pushing for a tougher stance by authorities. Despite the crackdown, protesters vowed to regroup, with Lencho Williams saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever."
