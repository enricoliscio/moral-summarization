Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article is about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone. The police chief called it lawless, and Trump wanted action. They arrested 31 people for various crimes. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly. The police chief, Carmen Best, mentioned recent shootings and deaths. The U.S. Attorney General commended her. A protester supported the crackdown, blaming outsiders for violence. The zone was set up after George Floyd's death, but it became chaotic with shootings and crimes. Trump labeled protesters as domestic terrorists. Conservative pundits used this to argue against the peacefulness of protests. The area had barricades and messages. Police used bikes to block off the area, and some officers had coffee, showing little resistance. The zone was less active, with fewer people and tents. Businesses wanted tougher action. Lawsuits were filed to prevent such zones. A protester, Lencho Williams, said they'd regroup, mentioning the movement's disorganization and their demands.

I should condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key points: Seattle authorities dismantling the protest zone, arrests, mayor's declaration, police chief's statement, Trump's reaction, the origin of the zone after Floyd's death, the chaos it turned into, the crackdown details, business and lawsuit responses, and the protesters' intent to regroup.

Make sure to include the main actors: Seattle police, mayor Durkan, Trump, Carmen Best, William Barr, the protesters, and the context of George Floyd. Highlight the transition from a peaceful protest to a lawless area, the police action, and the aftermath.

I'll structure it by starting with the action, then the background, the reactions, and the consequences. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
