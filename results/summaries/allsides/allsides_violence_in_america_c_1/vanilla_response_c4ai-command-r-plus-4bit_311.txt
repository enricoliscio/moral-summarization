SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone dubbed the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP) zone, citing recent shootings and violence. Police arrested 31 people for various alleged crimes, and the police chief highlighted the need to distinguish between peaceful protests and violent crime. U.S. President Donald Trump had called for action against the protesters, labeling them "domestic terrorists." The CHOP zone had been established following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and triggered a nationwide wave of protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Protesters vowed to regroup, despite the crackdown, emphasizing the continued fight for racial equality and justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
