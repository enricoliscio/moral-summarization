Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the tone.

The article is about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone called CHOP. The police chief, Carmen Best, called it "lawless and brutal," and President Trump also criticized it. The police moved in, arresting 31 people. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly after shootings and deaths of two teenagers. Attorney General Barr supported Best's actions, distinguishing between protest and crime. A protester, Rick Hearns, supported the crackdown, blaming outsiders for violence. The zone had become less active, with fewer people and resources. Businesses and attorneys were pushing for action, and some protesters plan to regroup.

Now, the moral framing seems to present the protest zone as problematic due to violence and lawlessness, with support from authorities and some protesters. It contrasts the initial peaceful protests against racial injustice with the later violence.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. I'll mention the dismantling, the reasons given by the authorities, the support from Barr, the protester's viewpoint, the decline in protest activity, and the plans to regroup.

I should ensure the summary reflects the conflict between the protest's initial purpose and the subsequent issues, highlighting the moral judgment against violence and the support for restoring order.

Let me structure it: start with the action, mention the reasons (violence, shootings), the support from authorities, the protester's perspective, the current state of the zone, and the future plans.

I need to keep it concise and within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without going over.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 and that the moral framing is preserved as in the original article.
