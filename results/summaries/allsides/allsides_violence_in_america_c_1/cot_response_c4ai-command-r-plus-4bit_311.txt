SUMMARY:
Authorities in Seattle moved to dismantle the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief. The operation resulted in the arrest of 31 individuals for various alleged crimes. The crackdown came after a spate of violence, including shootings and the deaths of two teenagers, which marred the otherwise successful month-long occupation. Protesters, who initially demanded police defunding, justice for the Black community, and amnesty for demonstrators, vowed to regroup despite the setback. The movement faced disorganization as the number of demands grew to twelve. The protest zone, established following the killing of George Floyd, had sparked a national wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality. U.S. President Donald Trump labeled the protesters as "domestic terrorists," while conservative pundits used the zone as evidence to support their narrative of protests being less peaceful than portrayed. Seattle's mayor and police chief distinguished between the right to protest and violent crime, emphasizing the need to restore law and order.
