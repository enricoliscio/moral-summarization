SUMMARY:
Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, which had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief. The zone, established in response to the killing of George Floyd, had seen a recent spate of shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. Police arrested 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. The police chief and U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended the action, distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. A protester, Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone had become less crowded and active in recent days, with businesses pushing for a tougher stance by authorities. Despite the dismantling, protesters vowed to regroup, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever."
END OF SUMMARY.
