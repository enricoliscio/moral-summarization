Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone called the CHOP. The police chief called it "lawless and brutal," and Trump wanted action against demonstrators. Police arrested 31 people for various crimes. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly after shootings and deaths. The attorney general praised the police chief for upholding the law. A protester supported the police action, blaming outsiders for violence. The zone started after George Floyd's death, with peaceful protests, but it became chaotic. Trump labeled protesters as domestic terrorists. The area had become less active, with fewer people and businesses wanting tougher action. Lawsuits were filed, and some protesters planned to regroup.

I need to capture the key points: the dismantling of CHOP, the reasons given by authorities, the reaction from different groups, and the broader context of protests and police response. I should highlight the moral aspects, like the tension between protest rights and violent crime, and the support from both law enforcement and some protesters.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. I'll start by stating the action taken by Seattle authorities, mention the reasons (shootings, unlawful assembly), the police response, reactions from the attorney general and a protester, the origin of the protest, and the outcomes like arrests and lawsuits. I'll end with the protesters' intent to regroup.

Let me structure this into a coherent summary, ensuring I include all the moral elements without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, citing lawlessness and violence. Police arrested 31 individuals after declaring the area an unlawful assembly, following shootings and deaths. U.S. Attorney General William Barr praised the police chief for upholding the law, while a protester supported the crackdown, blaming outsiders for violence. The zone, established after George Floyd's death, initially focused on peaceful protests against racial injustice. However, it became chaotic, prompting criticism from Trump, who labeled protesters as domestic terrorists. The area had seen a decline in activity, with businesses and some protesters pushing for tougher measures. Despite the operation's success, protesters vowed to regroup, emphasizing the movement's persistence. END OF SUMMARY.
