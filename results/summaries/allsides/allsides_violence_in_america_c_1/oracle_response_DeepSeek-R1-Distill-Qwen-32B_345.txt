Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone called CHOP. The police chief and the mayor are involved, and there's mention of violence, shootings, and crimes in the area. The article also talks about the reaction from the president, attorney general, and some protesters.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. I should note those words: lawless, assault, crimes, unlawful, assembly, shootings, deaths, crime, restoring, violence, brought, reestablishing, killing, hands, death, injustice, brutality, fatal, robberies, assaults, terrorists, matter.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these terms. I'll start by identifying the main events: the dismantling of the protest zone, the arrests, the mayor's declaration, the police chief's statement, the support from the attorney general, and the reactions from both the protesters and the authorities.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects, such as the "lawless" zone, the "unlawful assembly," the "violence," and the "crimes" that occurred. I'll mention the police action to "restore the rule of law" and the support from the attorney general. Also, include the protesters' perspective, some supporting the crackdown, others vowing to continue the movement.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all the key points without being too detailed. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the morally framed words and cover all the essential elements of the article.

SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone labeled "lawless and brutal" by Police Chief Carmen Best, following Mayor Jenny Durkan's declaration of an "unlawful assembly." Police arrested 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other crimes after retaking the area, which had become a hub of violence, shootings, robberies, and property crimes. Attorney General William Barr praised Best for "restoring the rule of law," while President Trump called for action against demonstrators, labeling them "domestic terrorists." Some protesters, like Harry Hearns, supported the crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone, born from protests against racial injustice and police brutality following George Floyd's killing, had become less active in recent days. Businesses and attorneys pushed for stronger action, with lawsuits filed to prevent future "lawless autonomous zones." Protesters vowed to regroup, emphasizing the enduring message of "Black lives matter now and forever." END OF SUMMARY.
