Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and identify where these words are used.

The article is about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone called CHOP. They used terms like "lawless," "assault," "crimes," "unlawful assembly," "shootings," "deaths," "crime," "restoring," "violence," "brought," "reestablishing," "killing," "hands," "death," "injustice," "brutality," "fatal," "robberies," "assaults," "terrorists," and "matter." 

I should start by outlining the key events: the protest zone was declared unlawful, police moved in, arrests were made, the zone had become lawless with shootings and violence, Trump's involvement, the response from the attorney general, and the protesters' reactions.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me structure it to cover the main points while weaving in those terms.

First, mention the dismantling of the protest zone, using "lawless" and "unlawful assembly." Then talk about the police action, including arrests and the crimes involved. Highlight the shootings and deaths, emphasizing the violence. Include Trump's labeling as "domestic terrorists" and the attorney general's support for restoring the law. Also, mention the protesters' perspective and their support for the police action despite the initial goals.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral terms.

SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone, described as "lawless and brutal," after it became plagued by shootings, robberies, and assaults. Police arrested 31 individuals for failure to disperse and other crimes, following Mayor Jenny Durkan's declaration of an "unlawful assembly." The zone, which had grown violent, led Attorney General William Barr to commend the police for "restoring the rule of law." President Trump labeled the protesters "domestic terrorists." Protesters like Harry Hearns supported the crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone, born from protests against racial injustice and police brutality following George Floyd's death, had become less active. Businesses and attorneys pushed for stronger action, with lawsuits filed to prevent future "lawless autonomous zones." Protesters vowed to regroup, emphasizing that "Black lives matter now and forever." END OF SUMMARY.
