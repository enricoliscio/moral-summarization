Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed news article about Seattle's protest zone and want a summary that includes the morally charged words. 

The user has a specific process: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, then write a concise summary using those words. I should make sure to follow these steps precisely. 

Looking at the article, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "lawless," "brutal," "violent," "unlawful," "peaceful," "terrorism," etc. These terms are used to frame the situation in a moral context, either positive or negative.

Next, I need to write a summary that's under 200 words. I'll have to condense the article, focusing on the key events: the dismantling of the protest zone, the arrests, the mayor's declaration, the police chief's statement, Trump's involvement, and the reactions from different groups. I should include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting from the police action, then the reasons behind it, the reactions from officials and protesters, and the aftermath. I'll need to keep it concise but comprehensive, hitting all the main points without getting too detailed.

Also, I must remember to structure my response with the STEP 1 section listing the moral words and then the SUMMARY section following the specified tokens. I'll make sure not to use any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

I think I've got a good grasp on the article's content and the user's requirements. Time to put it all together, making sure each step is followed correctly and the summary is both accurate and within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone, described as "lawless and brutal," after weeks of unrest following George Floyd's death. Police arrested 31 people, citing failures to disperse and violent crimes. Mayor Jenny Durkan declared the gathering an "unlawful assembly," while Police Chief Carmen Best emphasized the need to restore order amid shootings and property crimes. Attorney General William Barr praised Best for distinguishing between peaceful protest and violent crime. Protesters like Harry Hearns supported the crackdown, blaming outsiders for violence. The zone, known as CHOP, had become a symbol of resistance but also a hotspot for crime. Businesses and some protesters criticized the disorder, with lawsuits filed to prevent future "autonomous zones." Despite the crackdown, protesters vowed to regroup, insisting the movement for racial justice would continue. END OF SUMMARY.
