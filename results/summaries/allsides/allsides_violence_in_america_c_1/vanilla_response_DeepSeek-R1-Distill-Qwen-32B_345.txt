Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Seattle authorities moved to dismantle a protest zone called the "autonomous zone." The police chief, Carmen Best, called it "lawless and brutal," and President Trump had urged action against demonstrators. On Wednesday, officers in protective gear arrested 31 people for various crimes. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly after recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. The U.S. Attorney General William Barr praised the police for distinguishing between protest rights and violent crime.

There's also a protester, Harry Hearns, who supported the police action, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone was established after George Floyd's death, leading to mostly peaceful protests. However, it became lawless with shootings and crimes, prompting the crackdown. Trump labeled the protesters as "domestic terrorists," and conservative pundits used the zone to argue that protests were more violent than portrayed. The police retook the area, and some businesses supported the action. There are lawsuits against the city, and protesters plan to regroup.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key events: the dismantling of the zone, arrests, mayor's declaration, police chief's comments, Trump's involvement, the protester's support, the origin of the zone, the violence that occurred, the police operation, business reactions, lawsuits, and future plans of the protesters.

I should structure it to include the main actors, actions, and outcomes. Make sure to mention the context of George Floyd, the shift from peaceful protests to lawlessness, and the political implications.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. Also, ensure clarity and that all important points are covered without unnecessary details.
