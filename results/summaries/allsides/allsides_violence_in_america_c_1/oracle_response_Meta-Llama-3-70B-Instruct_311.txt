SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, which had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief, Carmen Best. The area had seen a recent spate of "shootings" and the "deaths" of two teenagers, prompting police to move in and arrest 31 people for "failure to disperse", "assault", and other alleged "crimes". The police chief highlighted the need to distinguish between the right to protest and "violent crime", with U.S. Attorney General William Barr commending her efforts in "restoring the rule of law". Protesters had occupied the area for weeks, following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police, sparking nationwide demonstrations against "racial injustice" and "police brutality". While some protesters blamed "outsiders" for the "violence", others vowed to regroup and continue the movement, with one protester declaring, "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." END OF SUMMARY.
