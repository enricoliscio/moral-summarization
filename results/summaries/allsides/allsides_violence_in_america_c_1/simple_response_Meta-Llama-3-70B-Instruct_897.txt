SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, arresting 31 people for various crimes, after the police chief deemed it "lawless and brutal". The zone was established in response to the killing of George Floyd and had been occupied for weeks, with protesters demanding police reform and racial justice. However, the area had seen a recent spate of shootings and violence, prompting the mayor to declare it an "unlawful assembly". The police chief and US Attorney General William Barr commended the action, distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. Others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup and continue the movement, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." The moral framing of this event highlights the importance of balancing the right to protest with the need to maintain public safety and prevent violent crime.
