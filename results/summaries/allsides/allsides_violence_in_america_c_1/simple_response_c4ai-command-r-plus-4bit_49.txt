SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone that had been deemed an "autonomous zone" by protesters, following a spate of violence and criminal activity. Police arrested 31 people for various alleged crimes, including failure to disperse and assault, in an operation that met no serious resistance. The Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone had been established in the wake of George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis, with protesters demanding an end to racial injustice and police brutality. However, the zone was marred by violence, including shootings and robberies, which led to the deaths of two teenagers. The operation to retake the zone was supported by U.S. Attorney General William Barr and President Donald Trump, who had previously called for action against the demonstrators. Protesters, while acknowledging the issues with violence, attributed it to outsiders and vowed to regroup, highlighting their unwavering commitment to the cause of racial equality and justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
