Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Seattle dismantling a protest zone. The task has two parts: first, identify all the morally framed single words, and second, write a summary preserving those moral frames.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words mean. These are words that carry a moral judgment, like "lawless," "brutal," "violent," etc. I should go through the article and pick out each word that has a clear moral connotation.

Looking at the article, I'll start from the beginning. The police chief calls the zone "lawless and brutal." So "lawless" and "brutal" are definitely morally framed. Then, the president calls for action against demonstrators, which implies "violent" or "unlawful." The protesters are described as "failure to disperse," "assault," "crimes," so those are negative actions.

The mayor declares it an "unlawful assembly," which is another moral term. The police chief mentions "shootings," "deaths," "violence," and "property crimes," all negative. The attorney general commends the police for distinguishing between "right to protest" and "violent crime," so "violent" again. The protest zone is called "autonomous," which in this context might imply a lack of control, hence a moral issue.

The protest zone is referred to as "CHOP," which is an acronym, but "occupied" might carry a negative connotation here. The police are described as "armored," "baton-wielding," which are tools of control, so they have a moral implication. The protesters are "volunteering" for armed security, which is a positive action, but "armed" could be seen as negative in this context.

The article mentions "peaceful demonstrations" and "police brutality," which are moral terms. The slogans like "All Lives Donâ€™t Matter Until Black Lives Matter" and "RIP E Precinct" carry strong moral messages. The protesters are described as "disorganized" when their demands changed, which is a negative trait. The lawsuits aim to prevent "lawless" zones, so that's another moral term.

Finally, the protest leader says they'll regroup, showing persistence, which is a positive moral stance.

Now, compiling all these words: lawless, brutal, unlawful, assembly, crimes, violence, property, crime, occupied, autonomous, armored, baton-wielding, armed, peaceful, brutality, slogans, disorganized, lawless.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes these words as much as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main events and moral framing.

I'll start by stating that Seattle authorities dismantled the protest zone, using the terms "lawless" and "brutal." Mention the arrests and the mayor's declaration of unlawful assembly. Highlight the police chief's concerns about shootings and deaths, and the attorney general's support. Include the protester's perspective about outsiders bringing violence. Describe the police actions, the environment, and the end of the protest. Mention the lawsuits and the protesters' intent to regroup, emphasizing their commitment to the cause.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral terms without making it too long. I'll check each sentence to include the necessary words and maintain the moral framing as in the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone deemed "lawless and brutal" by the police chief, arresting 31 people for failure to disperse and other crimes. The zone, declared an "unlawful assembly" by Mayor Jenny Durkan, had become a hotspot for violence, including shootings and property crimes. U.S. Attorney General William Barr praised the police for restoring "the rule of law," while President Trump labeled the protesters "domestic terrorists." Protesters like Harry Hearns supported the police action, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone, once a symbol of the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP), had become less active, with businesses and attorneys pushing for its removal. Despite the crackdown, protesters vowed to regroup, emphasizing their commitment to the movement. END OF SUMMARY.
