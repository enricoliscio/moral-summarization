SUMMARY:
Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, which police chief Carmen Best described as "lawless and brutal". The zone was established in response to the killing of George Floyd and had become a hub for protests against racial injustice and police brutality. However, the area had seen a recent spate of shootings and the deaths of two teenagers, prompting authorities to take action. Police arrested 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime in "restoring the rule of law". Protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, blamed outsiders for the violence, saying "We don't represent violence. People brought that to us." Despite the crackdown, protester Lencho Williams vowed that the movement would regroup, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." END OF SUMMARY.
