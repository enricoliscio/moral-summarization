SUMMARY: 

Seattle authorities dismantled the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP) zone, which had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief. The zone, established in response to the killing of George Floyd, had been occupied by protesters for weeks, but had seen a recent surge in violence, including four shootings and two fatalities. Police arrested 31 people for various crimes, and retook control of the area. The move was commended by US Attorney General William Barr, who praised the distinction between the right to protest and violent crime. Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. However, others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup and continue the movement, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." The incident highlights the challenges of balancing the right to protest with maintaining public safety and order.
