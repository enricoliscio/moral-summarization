SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone that had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief, arresting 31 people for various alleged crimes. The Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone was established following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, triggering nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. The police chief highlighted recent shootings and deaths within the zone as reasons for the crackdown. U.S. President Donald Trump had labeled the protesters as "domestic terrorists," demanding local authorities take action. Protesters plan to regroup, citing their demands for police defunding, funding for the Black community, and amnesty for demonstrators.
END OF SUMMARY.
