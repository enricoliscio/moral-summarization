Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article is about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone called CHOP. The police chief called it "lawless and brutal," and Trump wanted action against demonstrators. They arrested 31 people for various crimes. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly, and the police chief mentioned shootings and deaths. The U.S. Attorney General praised her for restoring the rule of law. Some protesters supported the police action, blaming outsiders for the violence. The zone was set up after George Floyd's death, leading to peaceful protests, but it became lawless with shootings, robberies, and violence. Trump called protesters "domestic terrorists." The area was barricaded with signs, and police used armored vehicles. The zone was less active, and businesses wanted tougher action. Lawsuits were filed, and some protesters vowed to regroup.

Now, I need to extract the main points and use the morally framed words. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the dismantling of the protest zone, the police chief's description, Trump's demand, arrests, and the declaration of unlawful assembly. Then, I'll include the shootings, deaths, robberies, assaults, and the police's action to restore order. Mention the protesters' support for police, blaming outsiders, the origin of CHOP after Floyd's death, the transformation into a lawless area, Trump's domestic terrorist label, the barricades, and the protesters' plans to regroup.

I need to ensure that all the specified moral words are included where appropriate. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting from the action taken by authorities, the context of the protests, the issues that arose, the response from authorities, and the aftermath.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral terms are preserved.
