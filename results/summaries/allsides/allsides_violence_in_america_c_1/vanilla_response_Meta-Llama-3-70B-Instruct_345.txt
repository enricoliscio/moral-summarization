SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP) zone, arresting 31 people for various crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. The zone was established in response to the killing of George Floyd and had become a symbol of protests against racial injustice and police brutality. However, it had also seen violence and property crimes. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. Others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup and continue the movement, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever."
