Alright, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Seattle dismantling a protest zone and want a summary that preserves the moral framing. They also want me to identify the morally framed words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment, like 'lawless,' 'brutal,' or 'violent.' They convey a value judgment rather than just a neutral description.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each sentence and pick out words that have that moral connotation. For example, the police chief calls the zone "lawless and brutal." Those are definitely morally framed. Then there's 'unlawful assembly,' which implies something wrong. 'Violent crime' is another one, as well as 'domestic terrorists.' Words like 'peaceful,' 'fundamental,' 'unjust,' 'oppression,''revolution,' and 'just' also carry moral weight.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating the main action: Seattle authorities dismantling the protest zone. Then mention the police chief's description and the arrests. Include the mayor's declaration of unlawful assembly and the context of George Floyd's death. Highlight the Attorney General's support and the protesters' response. Also, note the shift from peaceful to violent acts, the support from some protesters, the police's actions, and the broader implications like lawsuits and the protesters' intent to regroup.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. It's important to retain the moral framing to reflect the author's perspective accurately.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include the identified words and keep it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to see if it captures the moral aspect without overcomplicating things. Once done, I'll present the identified words first and then the summary as per the user's instructions.
