SUMMARY:
Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" in the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) area, which had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief, Carmen Best. The zone had seen a recent spate of shootings, including two fatalities, and was criticized for its "unlawful assembly". The police arrested 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime, "restoring the rule of law". Protesters, however, claimed that outsiders had brought violence to the area, which had otherwise been a peaceful occupation. Despite the crackdown, protesters vowed to regroup, saying "you can't stop a revolution" and "Black lives matter now and forever". END OF SUMMARY.
