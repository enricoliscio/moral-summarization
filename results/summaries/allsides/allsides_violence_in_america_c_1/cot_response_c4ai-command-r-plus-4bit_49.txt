SUMMARY:
In a move commended by U.S. Attorney General William Barr, Seattle authorities dismantled the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, deeming it an "unlawful assembly." The police chief described the zone as "lawless and brutal," citing recent shootings and deaths. President Trump had labeled the protesters "domestic terrorists," demanding local action. The zone, established after the killing of George Floyd, had become a symbol of protest against racial injustice and police brutality. However, it was marred by violence and criminal activity, with businesses and residents calling for a tougher response. Protesters, while acknowledging the issues, attributed the violence to outsiders and vowed to regroup, emphasizing their call for revolution and amnesty.
END OF SUMMARY.
