SUMMARY: Seattle police dismantled the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, which had been deemed an "unlawful assembly" by the city's mayor due to recent shootings and violent crimes. The police chief highlighted the importance of distinguishing between peaceful protests and criminal activity, emphasizing that the zone had become "lawless and brutal." The operation resulted in 31 arrests, and the police were able to re-establish control over the area. Protesters, while acknowledging the violence that had marred the occupation, remained committed to the cause and vowed to continue their fight for racial justice and police reform. The situation in Seattle had drawn national attention, with President Trump demanding action and conservative pundits using it as evidence to criticize the broader protest movement. The incident underscores the complex ethical dimensions of balancing public safety and the right to peaceful assembly.

END OF SUMMARY.
