SUMMARY:
Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, which had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief. The zone, established after the killing of George Floyd, had seen a recent spate of shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. Police arrested 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, was commended by U.S. Attorney General William Barr for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime in "restoring the rule of law." Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. Others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." The dismantling of CHOP marks a turning point in the nationwide wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality. END OF SUMMARY.
