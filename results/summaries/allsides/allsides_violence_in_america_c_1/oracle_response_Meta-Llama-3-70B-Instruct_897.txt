SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled the "lawless and brutal" Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, arresting 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, highlighted a recent spate of shootings and the deaths of two teenagers, calling the gathering an "unlawful assembly." U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime in "restoring the rule of law." Protesters had occupied the area for weeks, following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which triggered nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality. However, the zone had become plagued by violence, with four shootings, robberies, assaults, and property crimes. Conservative pundits pointed to the zone as evidence that protests were not as peaceful as portrayed. Despite the crackdown, protesters vowed to regroup, saying "you can't stop a revolution" and "Black lives matter now and forever." END OF SUMMARY.
