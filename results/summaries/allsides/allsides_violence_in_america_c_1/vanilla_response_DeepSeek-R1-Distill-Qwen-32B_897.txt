Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Seattle dismantling a protest zone. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article talks about Seattle authorities removing a protest area called the "autonomous zone." The police chief called it "lawless and brutal," and Trump wanted action against the demonstrators. They arrested 31 people for various crimes. The mayor declared it an unlawful assembly after some shootings and deaths. The U.S. Attorney General commended the police chief but didn't mention the mayor, who's a Democrat. A protester who supported the crackdown blamed outsiders for the violence. The zone was set up after George Floyd's death, but it became less active recently. Businesses wanted tougher action, and there are lawsuits against the city. Protesters plan to regroup.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the dismantling, arrests, reasons (shootings, mayor's declaration), Trump's involvement, the origin of the protest (Floyd's death), the shift from peaceful to lawless, support from some protesters, business and legal actions, and the protesters' plans.

I'll structure it to cover all these points succinctly, making sure each sentence is clear and concise. I should avoid extra details and focus on the key events and outcomes.
