SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled a protest zone that had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief, arresting 31 people for various alleged crimes. The move came after a spate of recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers in the area. The zone, known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, had been established following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and triggered a nationwide wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality. U.S. President Donald Trump had called for action against the protesters, labeling them "domestic terrorists." Police retook control of the area, emphasizing the need to restore law and order. Protesters, however, vowed to regroup and continue their fight for racial justice. The CHOP zone had become less active in recent days, with crowds and support services disappearing. Businesses in the area had been calling for a tougher stance by authorities, and lawsuits have been filed against the city to prevent similar "autonomous zones" in the future.
END OF SUMMARY.
