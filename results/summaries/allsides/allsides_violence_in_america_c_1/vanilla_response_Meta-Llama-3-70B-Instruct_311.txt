SUMMARY:

Seattle authorities dismantled the "Capitol Hill Occupied Protest" (CHOP) zone, which had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief. Officers arrested 31 people for various crimes, including failure to disperse and assault. The zone had been occupied by protesters for weeks, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Despite being largely peaceful, the area had seen a recent spate of shootings and violence. US Attorney General William Barr commended the police chief for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. Some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. Others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup and continue the movement. The zone had become less crowded in recent days, with businesses in the area pushing for a tougher stance by authorities.

END OF SUMMARY.
