Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Seattle authorities dismantling a protest zone called CHOP, which was labeled lawless by the police chief. President Trump and Attorney General Barr supported the action, while some protesters and locals were divided on the violence.

I should focus on the moral aspects. The police chief and Barr are framing the zone as lawless and violent, contrasting it with peaceful protests. On the other hand, some protesters argue that outsiders brought the violence, and the movement continues despite the crackdown.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the dismantling, the police action, the arrests, and the reactions from different groups. I'll make sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sides: the authorities against lawlessness and violence, and the protesters emphasizing the continuation of their movement for racial justice.

I'll structure the summary to first state the action taken, then the reactions from the police and government officials, followed by the protesters' perspectives, and conclude with the ongoing support for the movement. This way, the moral framing is preserved, showing the conflict between law enforcement and the protesters' goals.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and factual. Let me make sure to include the key elements: the protest zone, the police action, the arrests, the support from Barr, the mixed reactions from protesters, the impact on the community, and the lawsuits. Also, mention the protesters' intention to regroup, emphasizing their commitment to the cause.

I think that covers all the necessary points while maintaining the moral perspectives presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, described by police as "lawless and brutal," following weeks of protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Police arrested 31 people, citing failure to disperse and other crimes, after Mayor Jenny Durkan declared the gathering an "unlawful assembly." U.S. Attorney General William Barr praised the police for restoring order, while President Trump labeled the protesters "domestic terrorists." Some protesters, like Harry Hearns, supported the police action, blaming outsiders for violence, while others, like Lencho Williams, vowed to regroup, emphasizing the movement's persistence. The zone, established after George Floyd's death, had become marked by shootings, robberies, and property crimes, leading to calls for stronger action from local businesses and lawsuits against the city. Despite the crackdown, the protest movement continues, with supporters asserting that "Black lives matter now and forever."
