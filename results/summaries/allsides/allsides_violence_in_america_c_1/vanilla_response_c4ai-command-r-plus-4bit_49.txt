SUMMARY: Authorities in Seattle moved to dismantle the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone, also known as the "autonomous zone," after a spate of recent shootings and violence. Police arrested 31 people for various crimes, including failure to disperse and assault, as they retook control of the area. The police chief, Carmen Best, highlighted the lawlessness and brutality that had taken over the zone, which had been established following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and was meant to protest racial injustice and police brutality. U.S. President Donald Trump had called for action against the demonstrators, labeling them "domestic terrorists." The zone, which was once a vibrant hub of protests and community support, had become less active in recent days, with businesses pushing for a tougher stance by authorities. Protesters vowed to regroup and continue their fight for racial justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
