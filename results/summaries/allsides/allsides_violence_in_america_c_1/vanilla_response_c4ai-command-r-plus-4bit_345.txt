SUMMARY: Authorities in Seattle dismantled the city's "autonomous zone," which had been established by protesters demonstrating against racial injustice and police brutality. The police chief derided the zone as "lawless and brutal" following a recent spate of shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. U.S. President Donald Trump had called for action against the protesters, labeling them "domestic terrorists." Police arrested 31 people for various alleged crimes, and the mayor declared the gathering an "unlawful assembly." Protesters, however, claimed that the movement had been disorganized and that their original demands had morphed, but they vowed to regroup and continue their fight for racial justice. The zone's dismantling was supported by some protesters who blamed violence on outsiders, while businesses in the area had been pushing for a tougher stance by authorities. Two class action lawsuits have been filed against the city, including one to prevent future "lawless autonomous zones."
END OF SUMMARY.
