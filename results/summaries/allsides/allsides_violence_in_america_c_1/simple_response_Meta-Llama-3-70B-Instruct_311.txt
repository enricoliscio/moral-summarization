SUMMARY: 

Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" in the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) area, arresting 31 people for various crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to recent shootings and the deaths of two teenagers. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime. The zone, which was established in response to the killing of George Floyd, had become increasingly violent and disorganized. Even some protesters, like Harry "Rick" Hearns, supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. The operation to retake the zone was largely peaceful, with police encountering little resistance. Despite the crackdown, protesters like Lencho Williams vowed to regroup and continue the movement, which they believe cannot be stopped.

END OF SUMMARY.
