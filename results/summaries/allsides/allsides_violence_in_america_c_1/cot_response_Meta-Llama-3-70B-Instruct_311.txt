SUMMARY:
Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" known as CHOP, which police chief Carmen Best described as "lawless and brutal". The area had seen a recent spate of shootings and the deaths of two teenagers, prompting Mayor Jenny Durkan to declare the gathering an "unlawful assembly". Police arrested 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime in "restoring the rule of law". Protester Harry "Rick" Hearns supported the police crackdown, blaming outsiders for the violence. The CHOP zone had become a symbol of the nationwide wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality, sparked by the killing of George Floyd. Despite the police action, protester Lencho Williams vowed that the movement would regroup, saying "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever."
