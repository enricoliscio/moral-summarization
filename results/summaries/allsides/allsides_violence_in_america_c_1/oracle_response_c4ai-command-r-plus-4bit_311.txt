SUMMARY: Seattle police dismantled a protest zone that had been deemed "lawless and brutal" by the city's police chief due to recent shootings and deaths. 31 people were arrested for crimes including failure to disperse and assault. The mayor declared the gathering an "unlawful assembly", and the police chief emphasized the need to distinguish between peaceful protest and violent crime. The zone had been established following the killing of George Floyd and was intended to raise awareness of racial injustice and police brutality. However, it had been marred by violence and criminal activity. The US Attorney General commended the police for restoring law and order, while protesters argued that the movement had been disorganized and that the issues they were fighting for remained unresolved.

END OF SUMMARY.
