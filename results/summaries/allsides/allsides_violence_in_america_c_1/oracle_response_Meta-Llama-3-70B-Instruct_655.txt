SUMMARY: Seattle authorities dismantled the "autonomous zone" on Wednesday, arresting 31 people for failure to disperse, assault, and other alleged crimes. The police chief, Carmen Best, described the zone as "lawless and brutal" due to a recent spate of shootings, deaths of two teenagers, and other violent crimes. The zone, which was established in response to the killing of George Floyd, had become a hub of violence, robberies, and assaults, prompting U.S. Attorney General William Barr to commend Best for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime in "restoring the rule of law." Protesters, however, blamed outsiders for the violence, claiming that the movement had become disorganized and lost its original focus on racial injustice and police brutality. Despite the crackdown, protesters vowed to regroup and continue their fight, with one protester declaring, "You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever." END OF SUMMARY.
