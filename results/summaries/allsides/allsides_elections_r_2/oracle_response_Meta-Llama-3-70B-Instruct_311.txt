SUMMARY:

A shocking undercover video by Project Veritas reveals a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting violence and riots if President Trump is reelected. Jurek says "cities burn" and "cops are going to be the ones that are getting beaten" at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He compares Trump supporters to Nazis, suggesting they need to be "re-educated" and even praises Soviet-style gulags as a means of doing so. Jurek also aligns himself with antifa, saying that Trump supporters are "scared senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." He even suggests dragging liberal media personalities out of studios and setting them on fire. The video raises questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's extremist views are representative of the campaign as a whole.
