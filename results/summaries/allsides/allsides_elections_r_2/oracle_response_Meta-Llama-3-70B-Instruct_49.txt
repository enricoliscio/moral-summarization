SUMMARY:

A shocking undercover video by Project Veritas reveals a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting violence and riots if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek says "cities burn" and "the cops are going to be the ones that are getting beaten" at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expresses support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek aligns himself with antifa, saying Trump supporters are "scared fâ€“ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." He even suggests dragging MSNBC journalists out by their hair and setting them on fire if Sanders doesn't win. The video raises questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. The Sanders campaign has not commented on the video.
