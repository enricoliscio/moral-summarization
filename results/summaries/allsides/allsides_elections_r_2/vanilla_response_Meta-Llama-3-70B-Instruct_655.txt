SUMMARY:

A Project Veritas video has surfaced, showing a man identified as Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders, making inflammatory statements. Jurek predicts violence against police and cities burning if President Trump wins reelection. He also expresses support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. In the undercover video, Jurek says that police will be "beaten" in riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee and that cities will burn if Sanders doesn't get the nomination. He also aligns himself with antifa, saying that Trump supporters are "scared fâ€“ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." The Sanders campaign has not commented on the video. Project Veritas has released FEC records showing Jurek's employment with the campaign.
