Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a Project Veritas video that was released, showing Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making some pretty intense statements. He mentions that cities would burn if Trump is re-elected and predicts violence at the Democratic National Convention. He also supports re-education camps, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, and praises Soviet gulags. The video includes some strong language and radical ideas. 

I should start the summary by mentioning the video and who Kyle Jurek is. Then, I'll note his predictions about violence and the burning of cities. It's important to highlight his support for re-education and gulags, as well as his comparison to Nazis. I should also mention the Project Veritas' role in releasing the video and the context of the 1968 DNC riots. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key points: Jurek's statements, his role in the Sanders campaign, the violent predictions, the re-education comments, and the criticism of Project Veritas. I should avoid getting into too much detail about each point, just the essentials. 

Let me structure it: start with the release of the video, identify Jurek, his quotes about cities burning, violence at the convention, support for gulags and re-education, comparison to Nazis, and mention the 1968 DNC reference. Then, note that the Sanders campaign hasn't responded, and mention the criticism towards Project Veritas. 

I think that covers the main points without going over the word limit. I'll make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the facts presented in the article.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday featured Kyle Jurek, a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, making controversial remarks, including predicting violence if Donald Trump is re-elected and suggesting cities would "burn." Jurek also expressed support for re-education camps, compared Trump supporters to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. He predicted riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, referencing the violent 1968 DNC in Chicago. Jurek linked Sanders' free tuition proposal to re-educating Trump supporters, drawing parallels to post-WWII Germany. He also criticized less radical liberals and media outlets. Project Veritas, which released the video, has been accused of deceptive editing, a claim denied by its president, James Oâ€™Keefe. The Sanders campaign has not responded to the allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
