SUMMARY:

A shocking undercover video by Project Veritas reveals a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders, Kyle Jurek, predicting violent riots and chaos if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek's disturbing remarks include saying "cities burn" and that police will be "beaten" in riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. Jurek's radical views align with antifa, and he even suggested violence against less radical liberals and media outlets. The video raises serious concerns about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and its tolerance for extremism. The Sanders campaign has refused to comment on the matter. The video's release sparks questions about the campaign's accountability and the moral character of its organizers.
