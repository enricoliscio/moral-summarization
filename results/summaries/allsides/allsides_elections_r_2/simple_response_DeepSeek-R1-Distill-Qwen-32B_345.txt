Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about a Project Veritas video revealing statements made by Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer. 

First, I'll identify the key points: Jurek predicts violence if Trump wins, supports re-education camps, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, and endorses gulags. He also threatens violence at the DNC. The author frames this as concerning for the Sanders campaign and questions the campaign's response.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include all these elements. I'll make sure to mention the video's release, Jurek's statements, his role in the campaign, and the implications for the campaign's image. Also, note that Project Veritas accuses the campaign of not addressing Jurek's remarks.

I need to maintain the original tone, which seems critical of Jurek's statements and the campaign's potential complicity. I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral concerns raised by the article.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video revealed statements by Kyle Jurek, a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, predicting violence if Donald Trump is reelected, including cities burning and police being beaten at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Jurek compared Trump supporters to Nazis, supported Soviet-style gulags for re-education, and endorsed violent tactics against opponents. He also criticized moderate Democrats and media outlets, suggesting extreme measures to prevent Sanders' defeat. The video raises concerns about the Sanders campaign's connection to such rhetoric, with Project Veritas questioning whether Jurek represents the campaign's true face. Sanders' team did not respond to the allegations. The footage highlights divisions within the Democratic Party and the potential for unrest during the convention. END OF SUMMARY.
