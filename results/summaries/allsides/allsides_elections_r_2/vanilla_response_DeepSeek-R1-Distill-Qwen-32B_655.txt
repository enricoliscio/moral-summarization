Okay, I need to summarize this article about a Project Veritas video involving a Sanders campaign organizer. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it needs to be returned after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The video shows Kyle Jurek, a Sanders organizer, making inflammatory statements about violence if Trump is reelected. He mentions cities burning, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, supports gulags, and predicts riots at the DNC. Project Veritas is releasing this as part of their #Expose2020 series. They provided FEC records showing Jurek's employment with Sanders. Sanders' campaign hasn't responded. Jurek also supports re-education and compares it to post-WWII Germany. He aligns with antifa and criticizes media outlets like MSNBC.

I need to condense this into a summary that includes who Jurek is, his statements about violence, the context of the DNC, the support for gulags and re-education, his alignment with antifa, and the lack of response from the Sanders campaign. Also, mention Project Veritas' role and the FEC records.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the release of the video, then Jurek's statements, his background, the Sanders campaign's silence, and the implications of his comments. Make sure it's under 200 words and flows logically.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without getting bogged down in details. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, I need to make sure the language is clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the user's request.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures all essential elements and adheres to the formatting instructions.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released on Tuesday features Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Sen. Bernie Sanders, making inflammatory remarks about potential violence if President Trump is reelected. Jurek suggested that "cities burn" and predicted riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, comparing the situation to the 1968 DNC in Chicago. He also supported re-educating Trump supporters, likening them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags as a means of breaking the "privilege" of billionaires. Jurek aligned with antifa, stating that "fascists understand only violence," and criticized mainstream media outlets, calling for their "light[ing] on fire." Project Veritas, which released the video as part of its #Expose2020 series, provided Federal Election Commission records showing Jurek's employment with the Sanders campaign. Sanders' campaign has not responded to the allegations. The video raises questions about Jurek's role within the campaign and whether his comments reflect broader sentiments within the Sanders team. END OF SUMMARY.
