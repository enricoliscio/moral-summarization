Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article is about a Project Veritas video featuring Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making controversial statements. He talks about violence if Trump is re-elected, supports reeducation camps, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, and praises gulags. The video also shows his support for antifa and threats against media outlets. 

I need to capture all these points succinctly. The user wants the summary to be under 200 words and include the moral framing, which seems to be critical of Jurek's statements and the Sanders campaign's response. 

I should start by identifying the main elements: Jurek's role, his statements about violence, reeducation, gulags, antifa, and threats. Also, mention the video's release by Project Veritas and the lack of response from the Sanders campaign. 

I need to ensure the summary is neutral but reflects the moral implications presented in the article. I'll structure it to highlight Jurek's statements and their potential impact on the campaign's image. 

Let me make sure to include all the key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented. 

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's clear and concise, preserving the moral framing as the author intended. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all critical points are covered.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video revealed statements made by Kyle Jurek, a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, suggesting violence if Donald Trump is re-elected, including the prediction that "cities burn." Jurek also expressed support for re-educating Trump supporters, comparing them to Nazis, praised Soviet-style gulags as a means of re-education, and threatened violence against police during the Democratic National Convention. He aligned with antifa, stating that "the only thing fascists understand is violence," and criticized less radical liberals and media outlets. Jurek's remarks, captured in an undercover video, sparked questions about his role within the Sanders campaign, with Project Veritas highlighting his employment ties. The Sanders campaign did not respond to the allegations. The video also criticized mainstream media, with Jurek threatening to "light them on fire in the streets" if they oppose Sanders. The moral framing underscores concerns about radicalism within the Democratic party and the potential consequences of such rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
