Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. The article is about a Project Veritas video that shows Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making some pretty extreme statements. The user provided the entire article, so I need to read through it carefully.

First, I should identify the main points. The video was released by Project Veritas, and it's part of their Expose2020 series. Kyle Jurek is talking about violence if Trump is re-elected, predicting riots in Milwaukee, and supporting reeducation camps. He compares Trump supporters to Nazis and supports gulags. He also mentions antifa and threatens media outlets.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I should include who Kyle Jurek is, his affiliation with Sanders, his statements about violence, reeducation, gulags, and the reactions. Also, note that Sanders hasn't responded yet.

I should structure it logically: introduce the video, mention Jurek's role, his extreme statements, the comparison to Nazis, support for gulags, prediction of violence at the convention, and the criticism of the media. Then mention that Project Veritas is accused of deceptive editing, which Jurek denies.

Make sure to include that the Sanders campaign hasn't commented. Also, highlight the comparison to 1968 Chicago riots and the potential for other cities to burn.

I should keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown or extra formatting. The summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I need to be concise but cover all key points without getting too detailed. Maybe start with the release of the video, who Jurek is, his statements, and the implications. Then mention the FEC records and the tweet from Sanders' campaign. Finally, note the criticism of Project Veritas and the lack of response from Sanders.

I think that's a solid structure. Let me put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released on Tuesday features Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, making controversial remarks. Jurek predicted violence and riots if President Trump is re-elected, stating, “Cities burn” and comparing the situation to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump supporters, likening them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags as a means of reeducation. Jurek threatened violence against police during the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, claiming it would escalate to involve the National Guard. He also criticized less radical liberals and media outlets, suggesting they should be “dragged out by their hair and burned.” Jurek’s comments sparked questions about his role in the Sanders campaign, with FEC records showing he has been paid by the campaign. Sanders’ team has not responded to the allegations. Project Veritas has faced criticism for allegedly deceptively editing its videos, a claim its president, James O’Keefe, denies. END OF SUMMARY.
