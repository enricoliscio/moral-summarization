Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and specified the morally charged words to include. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a Project Veritas video showing Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making controversial statements. He talks about violence, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, supports gulags, and predicts riots at the DNC.

Next, I need to identify the key morally framed words: violence, nazis, beaten, riots, clashed, nazi, nazified, drag, fire, editing. These words are crucial for the summary's moral tone.

I should start the summary by mentioning the video and Jurek's role. Then, highlight his violent predictions, the comparison to Nazis, support for gulags, and the riots. I'll also note the accusations against Project Veritas about deceptive editing.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to flow logically, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is evident. I'll make sure to include all specified words where appropriate without making the summary too cluttered.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the essence of the article and maintains the moral perspective as intended.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video revealed statements by Kyle Jurek, a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, predicting violence if Donald Trump is reelected, including "cities burn" and riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Jurek compared Trump supporters to Nazis, advocated for Soviet-style gulags as a form of reeducation, and expressed support for violence against police during protests. He also criticized less radical liberals and media outlets, suggesting they should be "dragged" and "lit on fire." Jurek linked Sanders' free tuition proposal to reeducating Trump supporters, drawing parallels to post-WWII Germany. The video, part of Project Veritas' #Expose2020 series, includes accusations of deceptive editing, which the organization denies. Sanders' campaign has not responded to the allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
