SUMMARY: In a recent undercover video released by Project Veritas, a man identified as Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, makes disturbing statements about the potential outcome of the 2020 election. Jurek predicts that "cities will burn" if President Trump wins reelection and that there will be violence against police at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He expresses support for reeducation camps for Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek also aligns himself with antifa, stating that Trump supporters are "scared senseless of anti-fascists" and that violence is the only thing fascists understand. He suggests that "dragging people out by their hair and lighting them on fire" is an appropriate response to those who oppose Sanders. The video raises questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are indicative of a larger sentiment within the campaign. Project Veritas has been criticized for allegedly deceptively editing its undercover videos, but the organization denies these claims.
