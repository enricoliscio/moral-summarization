Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. The user mentioned that these words are framed by the author, so I should look for words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "burn," "violence," "reeducation," "Nazis," "gulags," etc., seem to fit. I'll list each of these with a *.

Next, I have to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: the video released by Project Veritas, Kyle Jurek's statements about cities burning, his support for reeducation, comparison to Nazis, praise for gulags, and predictions of violence at the convention. I should also mention the reactions from the Sanders campaign and Project Veritas's response.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the key elements without being too verbose. I'll make sure to preserve the moral framing by using the identified words. Also, I should note that the Sanders campaign hasn't responded and that Project Veritas has been accused of deceptive editing.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first introduce the video, then detail Jurek's statements, mention his role in the campaign, and conclude with the reactions and implications. This should cover all the necessary points while adhering to the word limit and preserving the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  

A Project Veritas video released Tuesday showed Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making inflammatory statements. Jurek claimed that if Trump wins reelection, "cities burn" and predicted violence at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He compared Trump supporters to Nazis, praised Soviet-style gulags as tools for reeducation, and suggested that police would be "beaten" in riots. Jurek also expressed support for extreme measures, such as reeducation camps, to "break" the privilege of billionaires. He equated Trump supporters to Nazis, stating that reeducation would be necessary to "teach them not to be Nazis." Jurek aligned with antifa, claiming that "fascists understand only violence." Project Veritas highlighted Jurek's role in the Sanders campaign, earning about $11,000, and questioned whether he represents the campaign's true face. The Sanders campaign has not responded. Critics accuse Project Veritas of deceptively editing its videos.  

END OF SUMMARY.
