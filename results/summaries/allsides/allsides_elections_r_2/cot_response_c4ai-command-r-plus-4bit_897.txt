SUMMARY: In a recent Project Veritas video, a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, made shocking statements about what might happen if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek predicted that "cities will burn" and that police will be "beaten" at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, invoking memories of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis and praising Soviet-style gulags. Jurek, who has worked for the Sanders campaign for six months and earned about $11,000, said that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." He also suggested that "billionaires should go and break rocks for 12 hours a day" to learn what it means to be working-class and to lose their "privilege" and sense of being "superior." Jurek's comments have raised questions about whether he represents the hidden face of the Sanders campaign and whether they will take action in response. Project Veritas, which has been accused of deceptively editing videos, denies any wrongdoing.
