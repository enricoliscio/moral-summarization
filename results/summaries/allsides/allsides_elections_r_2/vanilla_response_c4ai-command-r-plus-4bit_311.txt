SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday revealed comments made by Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, expressing support for violence and predicting riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee if Trump wins reelection. Jurek compared Trump supporters to Nazis and suggested they would need to be reeducated, expressing admiration for Soviet-style gulags. He also predicted that "Milwaukee will burn" if Bernie Sanders doesn't get the nomination or it goes to a second round, and that police will be "beaten" in the riots. Jurek aligned himself with antifa and said that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." The video also showed Jurek disparaging liberal media outlets and suggesting they should be dragged out and "lit on fire." Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its undercover videos in the past, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these claims. 

END OF SUMMARY.
