Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words: violence, nazis, beaten, riots, clashed, nazi, nazified, drag, fire, editing. My summary should include as many of these as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a Project Veritas video where Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, makes controversial statements. He talks about cities burning if Trump is re-elected, supports re-education camps, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, and praises Soviet gulags. The article also mentions the Sanders campaign's response and Project Veritas' methods.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by identifying key events: the video release, Jurek's statements about violence, his support for re-education, comparisons to Nazis, and the campaign's possible reaction. I should include words like violence, nazis, beaten, riots, clashed, nazified, drag, fire, editing.

I'll structure the summary to mention the video, Jurek's role, his violent predictions, support for gulags, re-education, and the comparison to Nazis. I'll also note the Sanders campaign's lack of response and the criticism of Project Veritas' editing methods.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the necessary moral terms without making it too long. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video revealed a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, advocating for violence if Trump is re-elected, stating, “Cities burn” and predicting riots at the Democratic National Convention. He compared Trump supporters to Nazis, supported Soviet-style gulags for re-education, and called for dragging MSNBC employees into the streets and burning them. Jurek also aligned with antifa, claiming fascists understand only violence. The video, part of Project Veritas’ #Expose2020 series, includes federal records confirming Jurek’s role in the Sanders campaign. Critics accuse Project Veritas of deceptive editing, while the Sanders campaign has not responded. Jurek’s statements highlight a radical vision for societal change through violence and re-education, raising questions about the campaign’s connection to such views. END OF SUMMARY.
