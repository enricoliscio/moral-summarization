SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video exposes Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, expressing support for violence and ideological reeducation against Trump supporters. Jurek predicts "cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection and anticipates violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, even comparing it to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago where police clashed with protesters. He expresses support for antifa, stating that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." Jurek also aligns himself with Nazi ideology, suggesting that Trump supporters need to be "re-educated" in a similar manner to Nazis after World War II, and expresses admiration for Soviet-style gulags. He even suggests that media outlets like MSNBC should be dragged out and burned in the streets. The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek is a lone wolf or an isolated incident. Critics have accused Project Veritas of deceptively editing its undercover videos, but the organization denies these claims.
