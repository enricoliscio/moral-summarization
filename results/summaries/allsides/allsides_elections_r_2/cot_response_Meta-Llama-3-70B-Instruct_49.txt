SUMMARY:
A Project Veritas video exposed a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting violence and chaos if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek said "cities burn" and police would be "beaten" in riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. Jurek also aligned himself with antifa, saying Trump supporters are "scared f–ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." He even suggested dragging MSNBC staff out by their hair and setting them on fire if "they f–ing take Bernie from us." The Sanders campaign has not commented on the video. END OF SUMMARY.
