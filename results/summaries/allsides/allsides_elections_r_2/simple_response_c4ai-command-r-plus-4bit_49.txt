SUMMARY: A Project Veritas undercover video released Tuesday exposes a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer calling for violence against police and rioting at the Democratic National Convention if Mr. Sanders doesn't get the nomination. The organizer, identified as Kyle Jurek, also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump supporters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags, claiming they served a useful purpose. Jurek also aligned himself with the far-left antifa movement, saying that violence is the only thing fascists understand. The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and whether they will denounce Jurek's extreme views.

END OF SUMMARY.
