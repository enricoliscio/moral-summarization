SUMMARY:

A Project Veritas video exposes a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders, Kyle Jurek, predicting "cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. He predicted police would be "beaten" in riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, saying "the cops are going to be the ones that are getting f–ing beaten." Jurek also aligned himself with antifa, stating that Trump supporters are "scared f–ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." He made violent threats, including dragging MSNBC staff out by their hair and lighting them on fire in the streets. The video raises concerns about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and its tolerance for violent rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
