SUMMARY: A Project Veritas undercover video has exposed Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, expressing support for violence and ideological reeducation against Trump voters. Jurek predicts that "cities will burn" if President Trump wins reelection and that police will be "beaten" at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He compares Trump supporters to Nazis, praising Soviet-style gulags as a means of reeducation for the working class. Jurek also aligns himself with antifa, stating that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and whether they will denounce Jurek's extreme views. Critics have accused Project Veritas of deceptively editing its undercover videos, but the organization denies these claims. This incident underscores the moral dilemma of how to respond to extreme political views and potential violence in a democratic society.
