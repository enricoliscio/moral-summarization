SUMMARY: 
A recent Project Veritas video exposes Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Bernie Sanders, expressing support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praising gulags. Jurek predicts "cities will burn" if Trump wins reelection and violence against police at the 2020 DNC in Milwaukee. He aligns himself with antifa, stating that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." Jurek also advocates for the forced labor of billionaires to "break their privilege" and turn them into the working class. He justifies gulags as a means of reeducation and calls for violent retaliation if "they take Bernie from us." The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and their response to Jurek's statements. Critics accuse Project Veritas of deceptively editing undercover videos, but O'Keefe denies these claims.
