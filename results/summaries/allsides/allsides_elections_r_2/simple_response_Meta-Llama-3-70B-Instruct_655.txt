SUMMARY:

A shocking undercover video released by Project Veritas shows a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders, Kyle Jurek, making disturbing predictions of violence and chaos if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek is heard saying that "cities will burn" and that police will be "beaten" in riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. Jurek's rhetoric is alarming, suggesting that violence is an acceptable response to political disagreement. His comments have sparked concerns about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and its tolerance for extremism. The campaign has refused to comment on the matter.
