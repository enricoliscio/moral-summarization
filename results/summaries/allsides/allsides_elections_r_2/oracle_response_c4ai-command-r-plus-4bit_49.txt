SUMMARY: In a recent Project Veritas undercover video, a man identified as Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernard Sanders, made disturbing comments advocating for violence and riots if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek predicted that "cities burn" and that police will be "beaten" during riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags as a means of breaking the privilege of billionaires. Jurek aligned himself with antifa, stating that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." The video also showed him advocating for violent actions against liberal media outlets. Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its undercover videos, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these claims. The Sanders campaign has not responded to requests for comment.
