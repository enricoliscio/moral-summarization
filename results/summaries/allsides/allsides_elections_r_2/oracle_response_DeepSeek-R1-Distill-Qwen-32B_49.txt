Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a Project Veritas video featuring Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making some pretty intense statements. He mentions cities burning if Trump is re-elected, supports re-education camps similar to gulags, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, and predicts violence at the DNC. The author used words like violence, nazis, beaten, riots, clashed, nazi, nazified, drag, fire, editing.

I need to make sure my summary includes these words. I should start by identifying the key events: the release of the video, Jurek's statements about violence, his support for gulags, comparison to Nazis, and the context of the DNC. Also, mention Project Veritas' methods and the Sanders campaign's response or lack thereof.

I should structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, using the moral terms. Maybe start with the release of the video, then Jurek's quotes, his support for gulags and re-education, the comparison to Nazis, the prediction of riots, and end with the criticism of Project Veritas and the Sanders campaign's silence.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the key points and the moral framing words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me make sure I'm not adding any extra information beyond what's in the article and that I'm accurately representing Jurek's statements. Also, I should mention that the Sanders campaign didn't respond, which adds context about their stance on Jurek's comments.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video revealed a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, making controversial statements about potential violence if President Trump is re-elected, including "cities burn" and riots at the Democratic National Convention. Jurek compared Trump supporters to Nazis, supported Soviet-style gulags for re-education, and predicted police would be "beaten" in Milwaukee. He also criticized less radical liberals, suggesting they should be "dragged" and "fired." Jurek linked Bernie Sanders' free tuition proposal to re-educating Trump supporters, drawing parallels to post-Nazi Germany. He aligned with antifa, stating that "fascists understand only violence," and praised gulags as tools for re-education. The video sparked questions about Jurek's role in the Sanders campaign, which has not responded. Critics accuse Project Veritas of deceptive editing, though the group denies it. END OF SUMMARY.
