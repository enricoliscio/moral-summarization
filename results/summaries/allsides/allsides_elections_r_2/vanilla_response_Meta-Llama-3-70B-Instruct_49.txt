SUMMARY:

A Project Veritas video has surfaced, showing a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders, Kyle Jurek, making inflammatory statements. Jurek predicts violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee if President Trump wins reelection, saying "cities burn" and "the cops are going to be the ones that are getting f--ing beaten." He also expresses support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek aligns himself with antifa, saying that Trump supporters are scared of anti-fascists and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." The video raises questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. The Sanders campaign has not commented on the matter.
