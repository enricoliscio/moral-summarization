SUMMARY: A Project Veritas undercover video exposes a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer who makes disturbing comments about the 2020 election. The organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicts violence and riots if Trump wins reelection and calls for the ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis. He praises Soviet-style gulags and justifies violence against fascists, stating that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." Jurek also predicts that "Milwaukee will burn" if Bernie doesn't get the nomination, and that police will be beaten at the DNC convention. He expresses support for antifa and suggests dragging people out of MSNBC studios by their hair and lighting them on fire. Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its videos, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these claims. The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek is a lone wolf or represents a broader sentiment. END OF SUMMARY.
