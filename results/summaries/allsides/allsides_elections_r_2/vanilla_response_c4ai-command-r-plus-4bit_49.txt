SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday revealed controversial statements made by Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. In the undercover video, Jurek predicts violence and civil unrest if President Trump wins reelection, including rioting at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He expresses support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek also aligns himself with antifa and justifies violence against fascists. He suggests that Bernie Sanders' call for free tuition is aimed at reeducating Americans not to be "Nazis." The video also includes footage of Jurek making threatening comments about liberal media outlets. Project Veritas has been criticized for allegedly deceptively editing its undercover videos, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these accusations. The Sanders campaign has not responded to requests for comment.

END OF SUMMARY.
