SUMMARY: In a shocking revelation, a Project Veritas video exposed Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, making disturbing comments about political violence. Jurek predicted that "cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection and that there would be violent clashes with police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags as a means of breaking the privilege of billionaires. Jurek, who has worked for the Sanders campaign for six months, also aligned himself with antifa and advocated for violence against fascists. The video raises serious questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether they condone such extreme views. The Sanders campaign has not yet responded to requests for comment. This expos√© sheds light on the hidden face of political campaigns and the potential consequences of their ideologies.
END OF SUMMARY.
