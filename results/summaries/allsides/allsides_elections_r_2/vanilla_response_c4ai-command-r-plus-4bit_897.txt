SUMMARY: A Project Veritas undercover video released Tuesday showed a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer in Iowa predicting violence if President Trump wins reelection or if Mr. Sanders doesn’t get the Democratic nomination, praising Soviet-style gulags, and calling for the reeducation of Trump voters. In the video, the man identified as Kyle Jurek also predicts riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He says “cities burn” if Mr. Trump wins again and that police will be “beaten” in Milwaukee, drawing a comparison to the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Mr. Jurek also compared Trump supporters to Nazis and said they would need to be reeducated. He also praised gulags, saying they were “a lot better than what the CIA has told us” and that they were “meant for, like, reeducation.” The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Project Veritas has been accused by critics of deceptively editing its undercover videos, which its president, James O’Keefe, denies.
END OF SUMMARY.
