SUMMARY:
A Project Veritas video exposed a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting "f–ing cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. He predicted police would be "beaten" in riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Jurek aligned himself with antifa, saying Trump supporters are "scared f–ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." He also expressed violent sentiments towards less radical liberals and media outlets. The Sanders campaign has not commented on the video. END OF SUMMARY.
