SUMMARY:

A shocking undercover video by Project Veritas reveals a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting violence and chaos if President Trump is reelected. Jurek says "cities will burn" and police will be "beaten" at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expresses support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek's disturbing comments reveal a radical and violent ideology, aligning himself with antifa and suggesting that Trump supporters need to be "re-educated" to not be "fascists." His words are a stark warning of the dangers of extremism and intolerance in American politics. The Sanders campaign has yet to comment on Jurek's remarks, raising questions about the true nature of the campaign and its values. END OF SUMMARY.
