SUMMARY:

A shocking undercover video by Project Veritas reveals a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting "cities burn" and violence against police if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. He predicted police would be "beaten" in riots at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, saying "the cops are going to be the ones that are getting f–ing beaten." Jurek also aligned himself with antifa, stating that Trump supporters are "scared f–ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." He even suggested dragging liberal media personalities out by their hair and setting them on fire. The video raises concerns about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and its tolerance for violent rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
