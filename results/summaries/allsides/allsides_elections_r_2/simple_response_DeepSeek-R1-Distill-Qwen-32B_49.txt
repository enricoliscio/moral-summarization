Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about a Project Veritas video that shows a Sanders campaign organizer making some pretty intense statements. 

First, I should identify the key points. The organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicts violence if Trump wins, talks about cities burning, supports reeducation of Trump supporters, compares them to Nazis, praises gulags, and threatens violence at the DNC. The article also mentions that Jurek is a paid Sanders organizer, and Project Veritas is presenting this as part of their Expose2020 series. The Sanders campaign hasn't responded yet.

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements but keeps it under 200 words. I should present the information in a neutral way but include the moral framing, which seems to be critical of Jurek's statements and the Sanders campaign's association with him.

I'll start by mentioning the video and who it's about. Then, outline Jurek's statements: predicting violence, supporting reeducation, comparing to Nazis, praising gulags. Also, note his threats against police and the DNC. Mention that he's a paid organizer and that Sanders hasn't commented. Conclude by noting the controversy around Project Veritas's methods.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and doesn't go over the word limit. I'll need to be concise but include all necessary details to capture the moral framing without bias.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday features Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, making controversial statements. Jurek predicted violence and riots if President Trump is reelected, stating, “Cities burn” and comparing the 2020 Democratic National Convention to the violent 1968 Chicago convention. He also expressed support for reeducating Trump supporters, likening them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags as a means of breaking the privilege of billionaires. Jurek threatened violence against police and media outlets, calling for extreme measures to counteract Trump's reelection. Project Veritas revealed that Jurek has been a paid Sanders campaign organizer and is considered a top-tier organizer by the campaign. The Sanders campaign has not responded to the allegations. The video raises questions about the campaign's association with Jurek and its stance on violence and radical ideologies. END OF SUMMARY.
