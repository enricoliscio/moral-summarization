SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video exposes immoral and potentially violent rhetoric from a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek. Jurek predicts "cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection and anticipates violence against police at the 2020 DNC in Milwaukee. He expresses support for reeducation camps for Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek advocates for ideological reeducation, stating that it is necessary to "teach you not to be a fâ€“ing Nazi." He aligns himself with antifa, justifies violence against fascists, and threatens liberal media outlets. Project Veritas has been criticized for allegedly deceptively editing undercover videos, but the organization denies these claims. This incident raises serious moral concerns about the potential for political violence and the extreme ideologies held by some campaign organizers. Jurek's statements are highly offensive, unacceptable, and inexcusable, revealing a disturbing mindset within certain political circles. The Sanders campaign has not yet responded to requests for comment. END OF SUMMARY.
