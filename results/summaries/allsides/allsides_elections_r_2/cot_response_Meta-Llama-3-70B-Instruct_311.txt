SUMMARY:
A Project Veritas video exposed a Sanders campaign field organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting "f--ing cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. He predicted police would be "beaten" in riots at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Jurek said that if Bernie doesn't get the nomination, "f--ing Milwaukee will burn" and other cities will follow. He also expressed support for antifa, saying Trump supporters are "scared f--ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. END OF SUMMARY.
