Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about a Project Veritas video that was released, showing Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making some strong statements. He mentions that if Trump wins reelection, cities will burn and there will be violence against police at the Democratic convention. He also supports re-education camps, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, and praises gulags. The video also shows that Jurek is a key organizer for Sanders, and Project Veritas is pointing out these statements, questioning if Sanders will distance themselves from him. The article ends by mentioning that Project Veritas has been accused of deceptive editing, but they deny it.

So, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: who Jurek is, his comments about Trump's reelection leading to violence, his support for re-education, the comparison to Nazis, the reference to gulags, and the reactions from Project Veritas and the Sanders campaign. Also, note that the campaign hasn't responded yet. I should keep it concise, making sure to cover all key aspects without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first introduce the video and Jurek's role, then list his statements, and finally mention the implications and the lack of response from Sanders' team.
