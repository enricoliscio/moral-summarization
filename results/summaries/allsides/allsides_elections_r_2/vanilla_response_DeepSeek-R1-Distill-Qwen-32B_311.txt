Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a Project Veritas video that was released. It shows Kyle Jurek, who's a campaign organizer for Bernie Sanders, making some pretty strong statements. He says things like "cities burn" if Trump is reelected and predicts violence at the Democratic convention. He also supports reeducation camps and compares Trump supporters to Nazis. 

I should note that the video is part of their #Expose2020 series. They showed FEC records that Jurek has been working for Sanders and was briefly with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Project Veritas is asking if Jurek represents the Sanders campaign and if they'll distance themselves from him. The Sanders campaign hasn't responded yet.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll include the main points: who Jurek is, his statements about violence, support for gulags, comparison to Nazis, and the FEC records. Also, mention that Sanders hasn't commented yet. I should keep it factual and avoid any bias. Let me structure it in a few sentences, making sure each point is covered without going into too much detail.
