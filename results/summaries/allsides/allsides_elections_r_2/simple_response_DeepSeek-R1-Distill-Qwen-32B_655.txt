Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about a Project Veritas video showing Kyle Jurek, a Sanders campaign organizer, making some pretty intense statements. He talks about cities burning if Trump wins, supports reeducation camps, compares Trump supporters to Nazis, and praises gulags. The article also mentions Project Veritas' methods and the Sanders campaign's response.

I should focus on the key points: who Kyle Jurek is, his statements about violence and reeducation, the comparison to Nazis, support for gulags, and the context of the video. Also, note that Project Veritas is known for undercover work and has been accused of deceptive editing, which adds a layer of credibility concern.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Jurek and his role, then list his statements, and mention the criticism of Project Veritas. I should make sure to include that the Sanders campaign didn't respond. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts as presented, but highlight the moral implications, like the promotion of violence and repressive measures.

Let me structure it: introduce the video, who Jurek is, his statements, the context of the DNC, his support for gulags and reeducation, and the criticism towards Project Veritas. Conclude with the lack of response from the Sanders campaign and the implications of the statements.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all the necessary points without getting too bogged down in details. Also, keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the instructions. Double-check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday features Kyle Jurek, identified as a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, making controversial remarks about potential violence if Donald Trump is reelected. Jurek stated, “Cities burn” and predicted riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, comparing the situation to the 1968 DNC in Chicago. He also expressed support for re-educating Trump supporters, likening them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags as a means of breaking the “privilege” of the wealthy. Jurek aligned with antifa, claiming that “fascists understand only violence,” and criticized less radical liberals and media outlets. The video, part of Project Veritas' #Expose2020 series, raises questions about whether Jurek represents the Sanders campaign’s true stance. The Sanders campaign has not responded to the allegations. Critics have accused Project Veritas of deceptively editing its videos, a claim the organization denies. END OF SUMMARY.
