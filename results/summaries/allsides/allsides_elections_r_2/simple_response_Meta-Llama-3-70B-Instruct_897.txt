SUMMARY:

A Project Veritas undercover video exposes a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders, Kyle Jurek, making alarming statements. Jurek predicts violent riots and police beatings if President Trump wins reelection, saying "cities burn" and "the cops are going to be the ones that are getting f--ing beaten." He also expresses support for reeducating Trump voters, comparing them to Nazi supporters, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek aligns himself with antifa, saying fascists only understand violence, and makes threatening statements towards less radical liberals and media outlets. The video raises concerns about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. The Sanders campaign has not commented on the matter.
