SUMMARY:

A Project Veritas video has surfaced, showing a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernard Sanders, Kyle Jurek, making disturbing comments. Jurek predicted that "cities will burn" if President Trump wins reelection and expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis. He also praised Soviet-style gulags and predicted violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Jurek, who has worked for the Sanders campaign for six months, earning $11,000, also aligned himself with antifa, saying that Trump supporters are "scared senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." The Sanders campaign has not commented on the video. Project Veritas has faced criticism for deceptively editing its undercover videos, which its president, James O'Keefe, denies.
