SUMMARY:
A Project Veritas video exposed a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting "f–ing cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. Jurek predicted police would be "beaten" in riots at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He aligned himself with antifa, saying Trump supporters are "scared f–ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." Jurek also expressed violent sentiments towards MSNBC studios and liberal media outlets. The Sanders campaign has not commented on the video. The organizer's comments raise concerns about the campaign's true values and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. END OF SUMMARY.
