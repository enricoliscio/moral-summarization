SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday revealed inflammatory comments made by Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. In the undercover video, Jurek predicts that "cities will burn" if President Trump wins reelection and that there will be violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expresses support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, compares them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek, who has worked for the Sanders campaign for six months, earning about $11,000, aligns himself with antifa and justifies the use of violence against fascists. He also criticizes less radical liberals and media outlets, suggesting they be dragged out and "light them on fire in the streets." The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. Project Veritas, which has been accused of deceptively editing its undercover videos in the past, denies these claims.
