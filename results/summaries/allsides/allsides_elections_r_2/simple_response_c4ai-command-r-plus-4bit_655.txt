SUMMARY: Undercover footage released by Project Veritas purportedly shows Kyle Jurek, a paid organizer for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, endorsing political violence and praising authoritarian regimes. Jurek predicts “cities burn” if President Trump wins reelection and threatens violence at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He advocates for reeducation camps for Trump supporters, drawing parallels to Nazi Germany and expressing admiration for Soviet-style gulags and Joseph Stalin. Jurek also aligns himself with Antifa and justifies violence against political opponents, stating that “the only thing fascists understand is violence.” He suggests using violence against liberal media outlets if “they take Bernie from us.” The video raises questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are indicative of a larger issue within the campaign or the Democratic Party. The Sanders campaign has not responded to requests for comment.

END OF SUMMARY.
