SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday revealed a man identified as a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, Kyle Jurek, making disturbing comments about violence and rioting if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. He also predicted violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, saying "The cops are going to be the ones that are getting beaten in Milwaukee." Jurek aligned himself with antifa and expressed disdain for less radical liberals and media outlets. The video also showed FEC records confirming Jurek's employment with the Sanders campaign for six months, earning about $11,000. Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its undercover videos, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these claims.

END OF SUMMARY.
