SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video released Tuesday revealed shocking statements made by Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Jurek predicted "cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection and expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis. He praised Soviet-style gulags and predicted violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, saying "The cops are going to be the ones that are getting beaten." Jurek also aligned himself with antifa, stating that Trump supporters are scared of anti-fascists and that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." He suggested that if "they take Bernie from us," there would be nothing left to lose. The video raised questions about Jurek's role in the Sanders campaign and whether his views represent the hidden face of the campaign. Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its undercover videos, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these claims. The Sanders campaign has not responded to requests for comment.
END OF SUMMARY.
