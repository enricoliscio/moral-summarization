SUMMARY: Project Veritas released a video exposing a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, making disturbing comments about rioting and violence. Jurek said that "cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection and predicted that police would be "beaten" at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis and praising Soviet-style gulags. Jurek aligned himself with antifa, saying that Trump supporters are "scared" of anti-fascists and that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." He also made threatening comments about liberal media outlets, suggesting they be dragged out and lit on fire. The video raises questions about the true face of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its undercover videos, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these claims.
