SUMMARY:

A Project Veritas video shows a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, predicting violence and chaos if President Trump wins reelection. Jurek says "cities burn" and that police will be "beaten" in riots at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expresses support for reeducating Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek aligns himself with antifa, saying that Trump supporters are "scared senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." He also takes shots at less radical liberals and media outlets, saying they should be dragged out and set on fire. The video raises questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. The Sanders campaign has not commented on the video.
