SUMMARY: Project Veritas released a video exposing a Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, expressing violent and extremist views. Jurek predicts "cities will burn" if Trump wins reelection and that police will be beaten at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. He also expresses support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praises Soviet-style gulags. Jurek aligns himself with antifa, stating that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." He suggests that billionaires should "go out and break rocks for 12 hours a day" to learn what it means to be working-class. Jurek's comments raise serious concerns about the potential for violent extremism within political campaigns. The Sanders campaign has not responded to requests for comment. Project Veritas has been criticized for allegedly deceptively editing videos, but founder James O'Keefe denies these claims. This incident underscores the importance of moral and ethical considerations in politics and the need for peaceful and respectful discourse.
END OF SUMMARY.
