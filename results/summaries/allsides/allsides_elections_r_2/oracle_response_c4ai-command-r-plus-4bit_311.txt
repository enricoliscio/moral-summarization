SUMMARY: A Project Veritas video has exposed Kyle Jurek, a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, making disturbing comments about violence and rioting. Jurek predicted that "cities burn" if President Trump wins reelection and that there would be violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, comparing it to the 1968 convention where police clashed with protesters. He also expressed support for reeducation camps for Trump supporters, drawing comparisons to Nazi Germany and praising Soviet-style gulags. Jurek, who has worked for the Sanders campaign for six months, aligned himself with antifa and stated that "the only thing fascists understand is violence." He also made threatening comments about liberal media outlets, saying they should be "dragged out by their hair and lit on fire." The video raises questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign, and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology. Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its undercover videos, but its president, James O'Keefe, denies these claims.
