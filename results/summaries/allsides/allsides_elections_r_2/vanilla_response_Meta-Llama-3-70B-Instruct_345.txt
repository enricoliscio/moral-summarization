SUMMARY:

A Project Veritas video has surfaced, showing a campaign organizer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernard Sanders, Kyle Jurek, making disturbing comments. Jurek predicts violence against police at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee if President Trump wins reelection, saying "cities burn" and "the cops are going to be the ones that are getting f–ing beaten." He also expressed support for ideological reeducation of Trump voters, comparing them to Nazis, and praised Soviet-style gulags. Jurek aligned himself with antifa, stating that Trump supporters are "scared f–ing senseless of anti-fascists" and that "the only thing that fascists understand is violence." The video has raised questions about the true nature of the Sanders campaign and whether Jurek's views are representative of the campaign's ideology.
