Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed news article about a Project Veritas video involving a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, making some pretty intense statements. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, write a summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I should read through the article carefully to pick out the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation, indicating a moral judgment. For example, words like "burn," "violence," "reeducation," "Nazis," "gulags," "fascists," etc., seem to be morally charged because they relate to extreme actions, ideologies, or historical contexts with negative connotations.

I'll go through each paragraph and list these words. The article mentions "cities burn," which is a strong statement implying destruction. Then there's "violence against police," "reeducation," comparing people to "Nazis," praising "gulags," predicting police being "beaten," and so on. Each of these terms carries a moral judgment, either negative or extreme.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes these terms without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture the main points: who is involved, what was said, the implications, and the reactions. I have to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll include words like "burn," "violence," "reeducation," "Nazis," "gulags," "fascists," etc., as they are central to the moral arguments presented.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the video and who was involved, then outline the statements made by Kyle Jurek, including the predictions of violence, support for reeducation, comparisons to historical events and figures, and the reactions from the Sanders campaign and Project Veritas. I'll need to keep each sentence tight and focused on the key points, ensuring that the morally framed words are included to reflect the original article's tone.

I also need to mention that Project Veritas has been accused of deceptive editing, as that adds context to the credibility of the video. However, since the summary needs to be concise, I'll include this point briefly.

Now, putting it all together, I'll start with the release of the video, identify Kyle Jurek's role, his statements about the consequences of Trump's reelection, his support for extreme measures like reeducation camps, his violent predictions, and the reactions from both sides. I'll make sure to include all the morally charged words without making the summary too lengthy.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Let me just check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll count the words in the summary to confirm. It looks good, so I can proceed to present the final summary as per the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
A Project Veritas video revealed a Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, Kyle Jurek, making controversial remarks, including that "cities burn" if Trump is reelected and predicting violence at the Democratic National Convention. Jurek supported reeducation camps for Trump supporters, compared them to Nazis, praised Soviet gulags, and called for violent riots. He also criticized less radical liberals and media outlets, suggesting they should be "dragged out" and "lit on fire." Jurek linked Sanders' free tuition proposal to reeducation efforts, drawing parallels to post-WWII Germany. He aligned with antifa, stating that fascists understand only violence. The Sanders campaign did not respond to the allegations. Project Veritas has been accused of deceptively editing its videos, a claim it denies. END OF SUMMARY.
