Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of killing 10 people. His motive seems to be rejection by a classmate, Shana Fisher, who had rejected his advances. The article also mentions another shooting in Maryland where a student killed someone he was in a relationship with. The authorities haven't confirmed Pagourtzis' motive yet, but there are reports about his emotional state and family background.

I should include words like "shooting," "rampage," "killed," "attack," "murdering," etc., as these carry moral weight. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main events and moral implications.

I'll start by stating the incident, the suspect, and the victims. Then mention the rejected advances and the potential motive. I'll also touch on the community's reaction and the ongoing debate about gun control. Finally, I'll note the authorities' statements and the suspect's emotional state.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved. I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary natural.

SUMMARY: A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of killing eight students and two teachers in a shooting rampage at a Houston-area high school. The suspect reportedly made aggressive advances toward one of his victims, Shana Fisher, who rejected him. Fisher stood up to him in class, and a week later, Pagourtzis allegedly opened fire, with Shana being the first to die. This incident follows a similar school shooting in Maryland, where a student killed a former romantic partner. Authorities have not confirmed Pagourtzis' motive, though his attorney noted his emotional state. The school district denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied. The attack, the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school, sparked grief and vigils in the community. Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated Pagourtzis likely obtained the firearms legally from his father. The suspect's family expressed shock and sadness, while the NRA called for increased school security rather than restricting gun rights. The tragedy reignited debates over gun control and school safety. END OF SUMMARY.
