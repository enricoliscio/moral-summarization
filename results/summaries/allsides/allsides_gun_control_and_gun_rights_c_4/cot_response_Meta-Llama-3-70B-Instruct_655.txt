SUMMARY:
A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, fatally shot eight students and two teachers at a Houston-area high school, allegedly driven by rejection from one of his victims, Shana Fisher, 16, who had embarrassed him in class after he made aggressive advances towards her. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied, calling them "untrue". The community is in a state of anguish and grief, with many attending emotional services at local churches and mosques. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter laws and others, like the NRA, advocating for increased security measures in schools. Pagourtzis' family is "saddened and dismayed" by the shooting, and is cooperating with authorities. END OF SUMMARY.
