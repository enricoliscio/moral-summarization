Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to first identify all the single words that carry a moral connotation in the article. Then, I have to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll go through the article and pick out the words that have a moral or ethical implication. Words like "rejected," "aggressive," "confessed," "massacre," "loner," "mourners," "grieving," "controversy," "activists," "advocacy," "oppressed," "rights," "protection," "courage," "shocked," and "saddened." These words carry emotions or judgments about the actions and events described.

Next, I need to craft a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning the 17-year-old suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, and the tragic event where he killed 10 people. I'll note the rejected advances and the subsequent violence. I'll include details about the investigation, the school's denial of bullying claims, and the suspect's profile as a quiet loner. Then, I'll touch on the community's response, the national debate on gun control, the NRA's stance, and the governor's comments about the suspect's access to firearms. Finally, I'll mention the family's reaction and the ongoing investigation.

I must ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the key points while preserving the moral elements. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Let me structure this step by step to make sure I cover all necessary aspects without exceeding the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
A 17-year-old suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of killing 10 people at a Texas high school after being rejected by a classmate. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of victim Shana Fisher, claimed her daughter rejected Pagourtzis' aggressive advances, leading to the attack. This incident follows a similar school shooting in Maryland, where a student killed a former partner. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, but Pagourtzis confessed to the killings. The school district denied claims that he was bullied. Pagourtzis, described as a quiet loner, used firearms obtained from his father to carry out the attack. The community mourned the victims, with vigils and messages of support. The shooting reignited the national debate over gun control, with the NRA advocating for school security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated Pagourtzis wanted to commit suicide but lacked the courage. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and sadness, cooperating with authorities. The investigation continues.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
