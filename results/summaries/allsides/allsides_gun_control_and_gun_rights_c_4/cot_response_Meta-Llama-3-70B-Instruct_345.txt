SUMMARY:
A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting eight students and two teachers at a Houston-area high school. According to the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, who rejected him and embarrassed him in class. A week later, he opened fire on everyone he didn't like, with Shana being the first one. The school district denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied, calling them untrue. The community is now grieving and in anguish, with many churches and businesses showing support with messages like "Santa Fe strong". The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter laws and others, like the NRA, advocating for more security measures in schools. Pagourtzis' family is cooperating with authorities and has expressed dismay and shock over the events. END OF SUMMARY.
