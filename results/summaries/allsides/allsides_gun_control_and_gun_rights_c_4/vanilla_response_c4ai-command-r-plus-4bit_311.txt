SUMMARY: Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting ten people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of one of the victims, told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter, Shana Fisher, had rejected aggressive advances from Pagourtzis for months before the shooting. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. Police say Pagourtzis confessed to the killings but no motive has been determined yet. The school district denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Classmates described him as a quiet loner who played on the football team. He wore a black trench coat and used a pistol and shotgun in the attack. The community of Santa Fe has come together to mourn the victims, with many churches and businesses displaying messages of support. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and that he had intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and dismay and said they are cooperating with authorities.
END OF SUMMARY.
