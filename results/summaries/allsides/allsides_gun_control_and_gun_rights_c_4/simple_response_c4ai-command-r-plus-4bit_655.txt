SUMMARY: Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the 17-year-old boy charged with fatally shooting ten people at a Houston-area high school, had been aggressively pursuing one of his victims, 16-year-old Shana Fisher, for four months. According to Fisher's mother, Sadie Rodriguez, her daughter had rejected Pagourtzis' advances and stood up to him, embarrassing him in class. A week later, he opened fire on those he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. This incident follows a similar pattern to a school shooting in Maryland, where a student killed a former partner after she ended their relationship. 

The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied, and classmates described him as a quiet loner. The shooting has once again sparked debates about gun control and student safety, with NRA President Oliver North advocating for metal detectors in schools and more security assessments. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and dismay, cooperating with authorities, while Texas Governor Greg Abbott noted that Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage.

END OF SUMMARY.
