SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, went on a rampage at a Houston-area high school, fatally shooting eight students and two teachers, after being spurned by one of his victims, Shana Fisher, 16, who had rejected his aggressive advances. Fisher finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, and a week later, he opened fire on everyone he didn't like, making her the first victim. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. Pagourtzis confessed to the killings, but authorities have offered no motive yet for the massacre, the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history. The community is grieving, with many attending vigils and emotional services, while the NRA is advocating for metal detectors in schools and more use of free security assessments, rather than limiting gun ownership. The suspect's family is cooperating with authorities and is "saddened and dismayed" by the shooting. END OF SUMMARY.
