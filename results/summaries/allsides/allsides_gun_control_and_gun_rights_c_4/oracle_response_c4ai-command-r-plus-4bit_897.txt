SUMMARY: Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old teenage boy, has been charged with fatally shooting and murdering eight students and two teachers during a gun rampage at a Houston-area high school. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of Shana Fisher, one of the victims, told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter rejected four months of aggressive advances from Pagourtzis before the attack. Fisher stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, and a week later he opened fire, killing her and nine others. This is the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school, sparking debates over gun ownership and student safety. The NRA's Oliver North argued for more security in schools, while Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage. Pagourtzis has provided little information to authorities, and his family expressed sadness and dismay over the shooting. Mourners held vigils and embraced grieving victims' families.
