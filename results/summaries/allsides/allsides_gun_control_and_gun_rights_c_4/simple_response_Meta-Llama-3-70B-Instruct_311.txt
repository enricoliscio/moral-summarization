SUMMARY:

A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting 10 people, including 8 students and 2 teachers, at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. According to the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, who rejected him and embarrassed him in class. A week later, he allegedly opened fire on everyone he didn't like, with Shana being the first one. This tragic event is the second school shooting in recent months driven by rejection. The community is grieving, with churches and businesses showing support, and a national debate over gun ownership has been reignited. The NRA is advocating for metal detectors in schools and free security assessments, while the governor of Texas has revealed that Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father, who had likely acquired them legally.
