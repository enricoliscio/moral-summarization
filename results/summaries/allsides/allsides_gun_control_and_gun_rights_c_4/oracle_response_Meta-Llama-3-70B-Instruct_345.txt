SUMMARY:

A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, went on a rampage at a Houston-area high school, fatally shooting eight students and two teachers. The attack was allegedly driven by his rejection by one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, who had stood up to him and embarrassed him in class four months prior. Pagourtzis confessed to the killings after being taken into custody, but authorities have yet to determine a motive. The massacre is the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history. The community is left to grieve and mourn, with many attending emotional services and vigils to honor the victims. The tragedy has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter gun control measures. The NRA, however, advocates for increased security measures in schools rather than limiting the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Pagourtzis' family is "saddened and dismayed" by the shooting and is cooperating with authorities.

END OF SUMMARY.
