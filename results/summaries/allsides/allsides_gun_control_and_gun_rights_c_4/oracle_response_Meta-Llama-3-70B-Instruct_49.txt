SUMMARY:

A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, went on a gun rampage at a Houston-area high school, fatally shooting eight students and two teachers. One of his victims, Shana Fisher, 16, had rejected his aggressive advances four months prior, embarrassing him in class. A week later, he opened fire on everyone he didn't like, making Shana the first victim. Pagourtzis confessed to the killings, but authorities have yet to reveal a motive. This massacre is the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history. The community is in mourning, with many attending emotional services and vigils to pay tribute to the victims. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter gun control measures. The NRA, however, believes that metal detectors and security assessments can protect students without limiting the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Pagourtzis' family is cooperating with authorities and is "saddened and dismayed" by the shooting.

END OF SUMMARY.
