SUMMARY: A teenage boy charged with fatally shooting ten people at a Houston-area high school had been spurned by one of his victims after making aggressive advances, her mother told a newspaper. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of Shana Fisher, who was among those killed, said her daughter rejected four months of aggressive advances from Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the 17-year-old accused of the shooting. Fisher stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, and a week later he opened fire, with Fisher being the first victim. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. Pagourtzis has been charged with the murders of eight students and two teachers and is in jail. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Classmates described him as a quiet loner and a member of the football team. The community of Santa Fe has been left reeling, with many churches and businesses displaying messages of support and solidarity. Mourners gathered at vigils to remember the victims, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and had planned the attack, citing the suspect's journals. The family of Pagourtzis expressed their sorrow and dismay over the shooting and said they were cooperating with authorities.
END OF SUMMARY.
