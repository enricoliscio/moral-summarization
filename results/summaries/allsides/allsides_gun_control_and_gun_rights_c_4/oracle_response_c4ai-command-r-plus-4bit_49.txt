SUMMARY: Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, is accused of murdering eight students and two teachers in a gun rampage at a Houston-area high school. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter rejected aggressive advances from Pagourtzis for four months. Fisher stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, and a week later he opened fire, killing her and nine others. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by rejection. Police say Pagourtzis confessed to the killings, but no motive has been determined yet. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Mourners gathered at vigils to remember the victims, including a Pakistani exchange student who died in the attack. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and that he wanted to commit suicide but lacked the courage. The suspect's family expressed sadness and dismay and said they are cooperating with authorities.
END OF SUMMARY.
