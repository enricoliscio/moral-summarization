Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, shot 10 people, killing 8 students and 2 teachers. The mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, mentioned that Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, which were rejected. This led to the shooting, where Shana was the first victim. 

I should note that this isn't the first time a rejection has led to a school shooting; there was a similar case in Maryland. The authorities haven't confirmed a motive yet, but the school district denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied. He was described as a quiet loner on the football team, who used a pistol and shotgun in the attack.

After the shooting, the community came together for vigils, showing solidarity. The event reignited the debate on gun control, especially since the Parkland shooting. The NRA's stance is against limiting the Second Amendment, suggesting metal detectors instead. The governor mentioned that Pagourtzis got the guns from his father, and the suspect's family expressed shock and cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral aspects, like the rejection leading to violence and the community's response. I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, highlighting the emotional impact and the ongoing debate.

Let me structure this: start with the shooting details, mention the rejected advances, the denied bullying claims, the community's reaction, the gun control debate, and the suspect's background. Keep each point brief and clear.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows logically, preserving the moral elements discussed in the article.

SUMMARY: A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of fatally shooting eight students and two teachers at a Houston-area high school. The mother of one victim, Shana Fisher, claimed Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances toward her daughter, which were rejected. Fisher stood up to him in class, and a week later, Pagourtzis allegedly opened fire. This incident follows a similar school shooting in Maryland, where a student killed a former girlfriend. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, but the school district denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied. Described as a quiet loner, he used a pistol and shotgun in the attack. The community responded with vigils, displaying solidarity. The shooting reignited the national debate over gun control, with the NRA advocating for school security measures rather than restricting gun rights. Pagourtzis reportedly obtained the firearms from his father, and his family expressed shock and cooperation with authorities. END OF SUMMARY.
