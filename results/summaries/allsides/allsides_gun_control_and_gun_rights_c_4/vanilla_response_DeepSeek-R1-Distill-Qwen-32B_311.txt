Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of killing 10 people. His motive seems to be rejection from a girl he had been pursuing. Her mother mentioned that her daughter stood up to him, leading to the shooting.

I should note the details about the victims, the number of casualties, and the context of the shooting. Also, the article mentions another school shooting in Maryland where a student killed someone after a breakup, which is similar.

The school district denied that Pagourtzis was bullied, and classmates described him as a quiet loner on the football team. He used a pistol and shotgun, which he got from his father.

Aftermath details include community reactions, vigils, and the debate over gun control. The NRA's response is mentioned, suggesting metal detectors instead of limiting gun rights.

Pagourtzis hasn't provided much information, and his family is cooperating with authorities. The governor mentioned the firearms were likely obtained legally.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events, motives, reactions, and aftermath.
