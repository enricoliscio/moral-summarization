Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about a 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who is charged with killing 10 people at a high school. His motivation might have been rejection from a girl, Shana Fisher, who stood up to his aggressive advances. That seems important because it's similar to another recent case in Maryland where a student shot someone after a breakup.

The article also mentions that Pagourtzis confessed but authorities haven't confirmed a motive yet. There's some info about his background: he was a quiet loner on the football team, used a black trench coat, and had access to firearms from his father. The community's reaction is highlighted with vigils and support, and the debate over gun control is brought up again, referencing the NRA's stance.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the suspect, the victims, the possible motive, the lack of confirmed motive from authorities, his background, the community's response, and the ongoing gun control debate. I should also include the NRA's response and the fact that the suspect's family is cooperating with authorities.

Let me structure it: start with the incident, mention the possible motive, the confession, the background, the community's reaction, the gun control debate, and the family's statement. Make sure it's all within 200 words.
