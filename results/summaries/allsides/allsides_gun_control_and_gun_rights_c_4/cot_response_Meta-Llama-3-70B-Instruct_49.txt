SUMMARY:
A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting eight students and two teachers at a Houston-area high school. The motive behind the attack is believed to be rejection, as one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, had rejected his aggressive advances four months prior to the incident. Fisher had finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, which led to the devastating attack. The incident is the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history. The community is in grief and anguish, with many churches and businesses displaying signs of support. The NRA has weighed in on the debate, suggesting metal detectors in schools and more security assessments, while the governor of Texas has stated that the suspect's father had likely acquired the firearms legally. The suspect's family is "saddened and dismayed" by the shooting. END OF SUMMARY.
