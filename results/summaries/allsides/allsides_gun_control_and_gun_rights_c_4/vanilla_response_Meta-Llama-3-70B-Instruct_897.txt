According to the mother of one of the victims, Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, Shana Fisher, 16, who was killed in the attack, but was rejected. The mother claims that Pagourtzis was embarrassed by Fisher in class and a week later, opened fire on everyone he didn't like.
