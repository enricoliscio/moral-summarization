SUMMARY:

A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been accused of fatally shooting 10 people, including students and teachers, at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. According to the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, who rejected him and embarrassed him in class. The mother believes this rejection led to the shooting, which is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. Pagourtzis has confessed to the killings but has provided little information about the shootings. Authorities have denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied, including by a football coach. The community is grieving, with many attending vigils and services to mourn the victims. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter gun control measures and others advocating for increased security measures in schools.
