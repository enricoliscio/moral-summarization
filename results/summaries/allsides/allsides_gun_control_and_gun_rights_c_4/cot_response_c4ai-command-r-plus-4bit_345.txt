SUMMARY:
Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with the fatal shooting of eight students and two teachers at a Houston-area high school. According to the mother of one of his victims, Sadie Rodriguez, Pagourtzis made aggressive advances towards her daughter, Shana Fisher, 16, for four months. Fisher finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class. A week later, Pagourtzis opened fire on everyone he didn't like, killing Fisher first. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. Police said Pagourtzis confessed to the killings, but no motive has been determined yet. The school district denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied and described him as a quiet loner. The community of Santa Fe is grieving and showing support for the victims. Many are calling for stronger gun control measures, but the NRA President, Oliver North, defended the right to bear arms and suggested metal detectors in schools instead. Pagourtzis' attorney said his client has provided little information due to his emotional state. Texas' governor, Greg Abbott, said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and wanted to commit suicide but lacked the courage. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and is cooperating with authorities.
