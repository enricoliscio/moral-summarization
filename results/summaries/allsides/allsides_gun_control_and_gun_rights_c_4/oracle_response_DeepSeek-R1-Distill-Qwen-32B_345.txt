Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many of them as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key events are the school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, by a 17-year-old student who killed 10 people. The suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, had reportedly been rejected by one of his victims, Shana Fisher, after aggressive advances. This seems to be a recurring theme in school shootings where rejection leads to violence.

I should mention the rampage, the number of people killed, and the emotional impact on the community. Including terms like "massacre," "fourth-deadliest," and "emotional" helps maintain the moral tone. I'll also touch on the aftermath, like vigils and the debate over gun control, using words such as "vigil," "attended," and "embraced."

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details without going into too much depth. I'll structure it to highlight the suspect's actions, the victims, the community's response, and the ongoing debate. Making sure to include words like "shooting," "attack," "murdering," and "suicide" to maintain the moral framing as per the user's request.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the formatting requirements. I'll review the summary to make sure it flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral aspects.

SUMMARY: A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of killing eight students and two teachers in a shooting rampage at a Houston-area high school. The suspect reportedly made aggressive advances toward one of his victims, Shana Fisher, who rejected him. A week later, he allegedly opened fire, with Shana being the first to die. This incident follows a similar case in Maryland where a student killed a former romantic partner. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, though Pagourtzis reportedly confessed to the killings. The school district denied claims that he had been bullied. Pagourtzis was described as a quiet loner who played football. The community held vigils, with mourners attending emotional services and embracing each other. The shooting reignited the national debate over gun control, with NRA president Oliver North advocating for school security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. Pagourtzisâ€™ family expressed sadness and dismay, stating they were shocked by the events. The suspect reportedly obtained firearms from his father, who likely acquired them legally. Authorities have not released much information about his emotional state or motives. END OF SUMMARY.
