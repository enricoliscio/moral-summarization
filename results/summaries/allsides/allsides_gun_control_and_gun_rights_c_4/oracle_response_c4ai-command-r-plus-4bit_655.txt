SUMMARY: A teenage boy has been charged with the fatal shooting of eight students and two teachers during a gun rampage at a Houston-area high school. The suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of murdering 10 people, including 16-year-old Shana Fisher, who had rejected his aggressive advances. Fisher's mother told a newspaper that her daughter stood up to Pagourtzis and embarrassed him in class, and that a week later he opened fire on those he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. This incident comes amid a national debate over gun ownership and the right to bear arms. Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and has been charged with the killings, although his motive remains unknown. The NRA has advocated for metal detectors in schools and more security assessments, while Texas' governor, Greg Abbott, has stated that Pagourtzis wanted to commit suicide but lacked the courage. The suspect's family has expressed their sadness and dismay over the shooting and is cooperating with authorities.

END OF SUMMARY.
