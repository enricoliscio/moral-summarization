Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is charged with killing 10 people, including eight students and two teachers. The mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, mentions that her daughter rejected Pagourtzis's aggressive advances four months prior. Shana stood up to him in class, which led to Pagourtzis shooting her first. The article also mentions another school shooting in Maryland where a student killed someone he had a relationship with. Authorities haven't confirmed a motive yet, but the school district denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied. He was described as a quiet loner on the football team. The aftermath includes vigils and debates on gun control, with the NRA suggesting more security measures instead of restricting gun rights. The governor, Greg Abbott, noted that Pagourtzis got the guns from his father, and the family expressed shock and cooperation with authorities.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The article seems to highlight the link between rejection and violence, as well as the ongoing debate on gun control. I should mention the victims, the suspect's background, the denied bullying claims, the emotional impact, and the gun control debate. I need to make sure not to go over 200 words.

Let me structure it: Start with the shooting details, mention the mother's account of rejection leading to violence, compare it to the Maryland case, note the denied bullying, describe Pagourtzis, then the aftermath including vigils and the gun debate, and end with the family's statement.

I should ensure that the moral aspects are clear, like the consequences of rejection leading to violence and the debate on gun control. Also, include the NRA's stance and the governor's comments on gun acquisition.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll keep each point concise. Make sure to include all key points without going over the limit.

The mother of one victim, Shana Fisher, claims Pagourtzis made aggressive advances toward her daughter, who rejected him.

This case follows a similar incident in Maryland where a student killed someone after a relationship ended. Authorities have not confirmed Pagourtzis's motive, but the school district denied claims of bullying. Pagourtzis was described as a quiet loner on the football team. The aftermath included vigils and a national debate on gun control, with the NRA advocating for school security measures instead of restricting gun rights. Texas Governor Greg Abbott noted Pagourtzis obtained guns legally from his father. Pagourtzis's family expressed shock and cooperation with authorities. END OF SUMMARY.
