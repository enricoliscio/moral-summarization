SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with the fatal shooting of eight students and two teachers in a Houston-area high school. The mother of one of the victims, Sadie Rodriguez, revealed to the Los Angeles Times that her daughter, Shana Fisher, had rejected aggressive advances from Pagourtzis for four months before the shooting. Fisher eventually stood up to him, embarrassing him in class, after which Pagourtzis opened fire on those he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. This incident follows a similar pattern to a school shooting in Maryland, where a male student shot a female student after she ended their relationship. Pagourtzis has confessed to the killings but has provided little information, and authorities have not yet determined a motive. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated that Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage. The community in Santa Fe is grieving, with many churches and businesses showing their support. The NRA's Oliver North has suggested increased security in schools instead of limiting gun rights. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and dismay and is cooperating with authorities.
