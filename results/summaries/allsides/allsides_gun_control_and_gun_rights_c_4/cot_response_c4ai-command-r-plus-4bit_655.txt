SUMMARY:
In a devastating rampage that shocked the nation, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis murdered ten people at a Houston-area high school. The motive behind the massacre remains unclear, but it has been suggested that Pagourtzis had been aggressively pursuing one of his victims, 16-year-old Shana Fisher, who spurned his advances and later stood up to him, embarrassing him in class. This incident comes amidst a growing gun control movement led by student activists in the wake of other mass shootings. The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group, has advocated for the protection of law-abiding citizens' gun rights while also calling for increased security measures in schools. Texas Governor Greg Abbott revealed that Pagourtzis intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage, and that his family is cooperating with authorities. As the grieving community of Santa Fe mourns the loss of their loved ones, many are searching for answers and demanding action to prevent such tragedies from occurring again.
