Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, the main points are about a school shooting in Texas where a 17-year-old boy killed 10 people. The mother of one victim says the shooter had been rejected by her daughter, who stood up to him in class. This seems to be a key moral point, linking rejection to the violence.

I should note that the shooter confessed but authorities haven't stated a motive yet. Also, there were claims he was bullied, but the school district denied that. He was described as a quiet loner on the football team, which adds to the profile of a troubled individual.

The aftermath includes community support and vigils, which shows the impact on the community. The debate over gun control is mentioned, with the NRA's stance against limiting Second Amendment rights, suggesting a broader societal issue.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the shooting, the suspect, the victim's mother's account, the denied bullying claims, and the community's reaction. Then touch on the gun control debate and the suspect's emotional state.

I should ensure the moral framing is clear: the rejection leading to violence, the community's grief, and the ongoing debate about gun laws. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the facts presented.

Let me structure it: start with the event, then the motive, the denied bullying, the suspect's profile, community response, gun debate, and the suspect's emotional state. Keep each point brief.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll also ensure it's clear and flows well.

SUMMARY: A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of fatally shooting eight students and two teachers at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The mother of one victim, Shana Fisher, claimed her daughter rejected Pagourtzis after months of aggressive advances, leading to the attack. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, but Pagourtzis confessed to the killings. Classmates described him as a quiet loner on the football team, and claims of bullying were denied by the school district. The incident has sparked national debate over gun control, with the NRA advocating for school security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. Community members gathered for vigils and support, while Pagourtzisâ€™ family expressed shock and cooperation with authorities. END OF SUMMARY.
