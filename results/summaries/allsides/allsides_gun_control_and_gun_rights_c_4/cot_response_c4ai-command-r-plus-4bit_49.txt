SUMMARY:
A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with fatally shooting ten people, including eight students and two teachers, at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. The boy had been *spurned* by one of his victims, 16-year-old Shana Fisher, after making *aggressive* advances, according to her mother. Fisher had stood up to him and *embarrassed* him in class, and a week later, he opened fire, with her being the first victim. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. While the motive for the *massacre* is still unknown, the school district denied claims that Pagourtzis had been *bullied*. The boy's family expressed their *shock* and *dismay* over the incident and are cooperating with authorities. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said that Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and that the boy had intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage. The community in Santa Fe is grieving, with churches and businesses showing support, and mourners gathering to remember the victims. The shooting has once again sparked debates about gun control and student safety, with the NRA's Oliver North calling for more security measures in schools.
