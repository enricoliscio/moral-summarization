SUMMARY:

A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting 10 people, including 8 students and 2 teachers, at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. The motive behind the attack is believed to be rejection by one of his victims, Shana Fisher, 16, who had rejected his aggressive advances for four months. Fisher had finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, which led to the attack a week later. This incident is the second school shooting in recent months driven by rejection. The community is grieving, with many attending vigils and services to mourn the victims. The incident has sparked a national debate over gun ownership, with some advocating for stricter gun control laws, while others, like the NRA, believe that metal detectors and security assessments can prevent such incidents. The suspect's family has expressed shock and dismay over the events.
