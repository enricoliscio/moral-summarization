SUMMARY:
Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old boy, has been charged with the aggressive murder of eight students and two teachers in a gun rampage at a Houston-area high school. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, revealed to the Los Angeles Times that her daughter rejected four months of aggressive advances from Pagourtzis, who then opened fire on everyone who had spurned him, with Fisher being the first victim. While the motive for the massacre remains unknown, the Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. The NRA President, Oliver North, suggested that metal detectors in schools and increased security assessments could protect students without infringing on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and, according to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, lacked the courage to commit suicide despite his intentions. The community in Santa Fe is grieving, with churches and businesses showing their support for those affected by the tragedy.
