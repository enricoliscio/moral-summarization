Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Santa Fe, Texas school shooting. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about a 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who is charged with killing 10 people at a high school. It mentions that one of his victims, Shana Fisher, had rejected his aggressive advances months before the shooting. Her mother shared this information with a newspaper. This seems important because it suggests a possible motive, similar to another school shooting in Maryland where a student killed someone after a breakup.

The article also notes that Pagourtzis confessed to the killings but authorities haven't confirmed a motive yet. The school district denied claims that he was bullied, including by a football coach. He was described as a quiet loner on the football team who wore a black trench coat and used a pistol and shotgun in the attack.

In the aftermath, the community is grieving, with vigils and support from religious groups. The shooting has reignited the debate over gun control, especially since the Parkland shooting. The NRA's response is mentioned, focusing on school security rather than limiting gun rights.

Pagourtzis's attorney says he hasn't provided much information due to his emotional state, and the governor mentioned the firearms were likely obtained legally from his father. The family expressed shock and cooperation with authorities.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the event, mention the suspect, the victims, the possible motive from the rejected advances, the denial of bullying, the attack details, community reactions, the gun control debate, and the current status of the investigation.

I should make sure to include the key points without going into too much detail. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each sentence covers a main aspect without overlapping information.

First, introduce the incident and suspect. Then, mention the possible motive involving Shana Fisher. Next, the school's denial of bullying claims. Describe the attack briefly. Then, the community's reaction and the national debate on guns. Finally, mention the authorities' statements about the suspect's confession, the family's response, and the governor's comments on the firearms' origin.

I should also keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any jargon or overly complex sentences. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all critical points are included and that the summary flows logically from one point to the next without redundancy.
