Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article about a school shooting in Texas and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. I need to make sure I understand the key points and the moral aspects the author emphasized.

First, the article talks about a 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School. The mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, mentioned that Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, which were rejected. This seems to be a key moral point about how rejection might have led to the violence.

I should note that the authorities haven't confirmed a motive yet, but the mother's account suggests a possible connection. It's also important to mention the previous case in Maryland where a student shot someone after a breakup, which adds to the pattern of rejection leading to violence.

The article also discusses the aftermath, like the community's response and the ongoing debate about gun control. The NRA's stance is presented, which is another moral angle regarding the right to bear arms versus school safety.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include these elements: the shooting, the rejected advances, the possible motive, the community's reaction, the gun control debate, and the authorities' lack of confirmed motive. I should avoid including too much detail about the investigation or the suspect's background unless it's relevant to the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to first state the event, then mention the possible motive based on the mother's account, relate it to the Maryland case, describe the community's response, touch on the gun control debate, and conclude with the authorities' current stance on the motive.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and highlights the moral issues without getting bogged down in less relevant details. Also, I need to ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY: A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a Texas high school after allegedly being rejected by one of his victims, Shana Fisher. Fisher's mother claimed Pagourtzis made aggressive advances toward her daughter for months before the attack. If true, this would be the second school shooting in recent months linked to romantic rejection, following a Maryland case in March. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, though Pagourtzis reportedly confessed to the killings. The school district denied claims that he had been bullied. Pagourtzis, described as a quiet loner, used firearms obtained from his father. The incident has reignited the national debate over gun control, with the NRA advocating for school security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. Community members in Santa Fe are mourning the victims, with vigils and support efforts underway. END OF SUMMARY.
