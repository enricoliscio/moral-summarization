SUMMARY:

A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting 10 people, including 8 students and 2 teachers, at a Houston-area high school. According to the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, who rejected him and embarrassed him in class. This rejection may have motivated the attack. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. The suspect, described as a quiet loner, wore a black trench coat to school and opened fire with a pistol and shotgun. The community is grieving, with many attending vigils and services to mourn the victims. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter gun control measures and others advocating for increased security measures in schools. END OF SUMMARY.
