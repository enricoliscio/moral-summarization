SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with the fatal shooting of eight students and two teachers in a gun rampage at a Houston-area high school. The shooting was driven by rejection, as one of the victims, Shana Fisher, had spurned Pagourtzis' aggressive advances. Fisher's mother, Sadie Rodriguez, revealed that her daughter had stood up to Pagourtzis and embarrassed him in class, after which he opened fire on everyone he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. This incident follows a similar shooting in Maryland, where a student shot and killed a female student with whom he had a recently ended relationship. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Mourners gathered in churches and mosques to console grieving victims and their families. The NRA's Oliver North called for metal detectors in schools and more security assessments, while Texas' governor, Greg Abbott, said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and dismay and is cooperating with authorities.
END OF SUMMARY.
