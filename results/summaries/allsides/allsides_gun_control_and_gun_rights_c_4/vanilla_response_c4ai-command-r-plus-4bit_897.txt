SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with fatally shooting ten people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of one of the victims, told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter had rejected aggressive advances from Pagourtzis, and that may have been a motive for the shooting. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Many in the community are grieving and showing support for the victims, with churches and businesses displaying messages of solidarity. The shooting has reignited debates about gun control and school safety, with NRA President Oliver North calling for more security measures in schools. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and sadness over the events and is cooperating with authorities. Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated that Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage.
