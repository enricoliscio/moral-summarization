SUMMARY:

A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with fatally shooting 10 people, including 8 students and 2 teachers, at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. According to the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter for four months, but she rejected him and embarrassed him in class. A week later, he allegedly carried out the massacre. The motive behind the shooting is still unclear, but authorities have denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied. The community is in mourning, with many attending vigils and services to pay tribute to the victims. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter laws and others advocating for increased security measures in schools.
