SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with fatally shooting ten people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. The shooting was driven by rejection, as one of the victims, Shana Fisher, had spurned Pagourtzis' aggressive advances. Fisher's mother, Sadie Rodriguez, revealed that her daughter had stood up to Pagourtzis and embarrassed him in class, after which he opened fire on those he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. This incident follows a similar shooting in Maryland, where a student shot and killed a female student with whom he had a recently ended relationship. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied, and he is now in jail, accused of murdering ten people. Mourners gathered at churches and mosques to honor the victims, and Texas' governor, Greg Abbott, stated that Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage. The shooting has reignited debates about gun control and the role of the National Rifle Association in advocating for gun rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
