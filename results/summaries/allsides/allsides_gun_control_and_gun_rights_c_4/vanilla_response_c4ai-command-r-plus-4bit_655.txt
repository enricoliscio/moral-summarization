SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with fatally shooting ten people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. One of the victims' mothers, Sadie Rodriguez, told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter, Shana Fisher, had rejected aggressive advances from Pagourtzis for four months, and that he shot her first after she embarrassed him in class. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Classmates described him as a quiet loner who played on the football team. The shooting has reignited debates about gun control and school safety, with NRA President Oliver North calling for metal detectors in schools. Pagourtzis has confessed to the killings but provided little information. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and that he intended to commit suicide but lacked the courage. The community in Santa Fe has come together to mourn the victims and show support for those affected by the tragedy.
