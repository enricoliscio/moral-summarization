SUMMARY: Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old student at a Houston-area high school, has been charged with fatally shooting eight students and two teachers. The shooting is believed to have been driven by rejection, as one of the victims, Shana Fisher, had reportedly spurned Pagourtzis' aggressive advances. Fisher's mother told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter had stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, after which he opened fire on those he didn't like. This is the second school shooting in recent months with a similar motive. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Authorities have not yet offered a motive for the massacre, and Pagourtzis has provided little information. The shooting has reignited debates over gun control and school safety, with the NRA calling for metal detectors in schools and more use of their free security assessments. Texas' governor, Greg Abbott, said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and that the shooting was premeditated, citing the suspect's journals. The community in Santa Fe has come together to mourn the victims and offer support to those affected.
END OF SUMMARY.
