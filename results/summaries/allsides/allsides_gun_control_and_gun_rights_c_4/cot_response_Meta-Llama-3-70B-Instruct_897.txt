SUMMARY:
A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting 10 people, including eight students and two teachers, at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. The motive behind the attack is believed to be rejection, as one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, had spurned his aggressive advances four months prior to the attack. Fisher had finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, which led Pagourtzis to open fire on everyone he didn't like. The community is in a state of anguish and grief, with many churches and businesses displaying messages of support. The incident has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some advocating for stricter gun control laws. The suspect's family has expressed dismay and shock over the events, and is cooperating with authorities. END OF SUMMARY.
