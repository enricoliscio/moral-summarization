Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task has two parts: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about a school shooting in Texas. The shooter, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, killed eight students and two teachers. The mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, mentioned that Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, which were rejected. This seems to tie into the moral framing because it's about the shooter's actions and the consequences.

The user provided an example of how to structure the response, with STEP 1 listing the morally framed words and then a summary. I need to follow that structure. 

For STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "spurned," "aggressive," "rejected," "embarrassed," "opens fire," "massacre," "bullying," "quiet loner," "emotional state," "gun ownership," "pro-gun," "Second Amendment," "suicide," "saddened," "dismayed," and "shocked" all seem to have moral implications. They relate to actions, intentions, and societal issues.

Next, the summary needs to be concise, no more than 200 words, and include as many of these words as possible. I'll need to paraphrase the article, focusing on the key events and the moral aspects highlighted. The summary should mention the shooter's rejected advances, the victims, the school's response, the debate over gun control, and the shooter's family's reaction.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and covers all the main points without being too detailed. It's important to preserve the moral framing, so I'll use words like "aggressive advances," "rejected," "massacre," and "gun ownership" to maintain that aspect.

I also need to make sure that the summary doesn't include any new information not present in the article. It should be a faithful representation but shorter. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing the words and then the SUMMARY section, making sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll review everything to ensure clarity and that all key points are covered.

**SUMMARY:**  
A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of killing eight students and two teachers in a school shooting in Texas. The mother of one victim, Shana Fisher, claimed Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances toward her daughter, which were rejected. Shana reportedly embarrassed him in class, and a week later, Pagourtzis allegedly opened fire, with Shana being the first victim. This incident follows a similar school shooting in Maryland, where a student killed a former girlfriend. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, but Pagourtzis reportedly confessed to the killings. The school district denied claims that he had been bullied. Pagourtzis was described as a quiet loner who played football. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with the NRA advocating for school security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. Pagourtzisâ€™ family expressed shock and sadness, while Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated the suspect obtained firearms legally from his father. The emotional aftermath of the tragedy was marked by community vigils and support for the victims. END OF SUMMARY.
