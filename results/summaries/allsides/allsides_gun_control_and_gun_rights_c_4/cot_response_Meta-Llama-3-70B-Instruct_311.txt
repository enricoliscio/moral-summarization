SUMMARY:
A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting eight students and two teachers at a Houston-area high school. According to the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, 16, Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, but she rejected him and embarrassed him in class. A week later, he opened fire on everyone he didn't like, killing Shana first. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied, calling them untrue. The community is left to grieve and anguish, with many churches and businesses showing support with signs saying "Santa Fe strong". The shooting has sparked a national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter laws and others, like the NRA, advocating for more security measures in schools. Pagourtzis' family is saddened and dismayed by the shooting, and is cooperating with authorities. END OF SUMMARY.
