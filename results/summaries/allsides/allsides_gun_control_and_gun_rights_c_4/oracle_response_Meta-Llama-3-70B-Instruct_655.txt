SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, went on a rampage at a Houston-area high school, fatally shooting eight students and two teachers. One of his victims, 16-year-old Shana Fisher, had rejected his aggressive advances four months prior, embarrassing him in class. Her mother believes this rejection led to the massacre. Pagourtzis confessed to the killings after being taken into custody, but authorities have not yet disclosed a motive. The school district denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied. The community is grieving, with churches and businesses displaying messages of support. Mourners gathered for vigils, including at a mosque for 17-year-old Pakistani exchange student Sabika Sheikh, who died in the attack. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with the NRA advocating for increased security measures rather than limiting the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and dismay over the events. END OF SUMMARY.
