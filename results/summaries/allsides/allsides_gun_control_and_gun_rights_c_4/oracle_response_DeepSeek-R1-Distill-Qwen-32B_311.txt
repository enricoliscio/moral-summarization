Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, and a list of morally charged words the author used. My task is to create a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the shooting incident, the suspect's background, the victims, the aftermath, and the debate over gun control. The user wants the summary to include words like "shooting," "rampage," "killed," etc., so I need to make sure these are incorporated naturally.

I should start by identifying the main events: the shooting at Santa Fe High School, the suspect's name, the number of victims, and the context of rejection leading to the attack. Then, I'll mention the authorities' response and the lack of a confirmed motive. Including the community's reaction, like vigils and the debate on gun control, is also important.

I need to ensure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and flows well. I'll structure it by first stating the incident, then the suspect's background, the community's reaction, and the ongoing debates. I'll use the provided morally framed words to highlight the severity and impact of the event.

Let me draft a few sentences, making sure each includes the necessary terms without sounding forced. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the moral implications and includes all key points from the article.

SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is charged with killing eight students and two teachers in a shooting rampage at Santa Fe High School in Texas. The suspect, who reportedly made aggressive advances toward one of his victims, Shana Fisher, was rejected by her before the attack. Fisher was the first to be killed. The incident, the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school, has sparked grief and debate over gun control. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, though the suspect reportedly confessed to the killings. Pagourtzis, described as a quiet loner, used firearms obtained from his father. His family expressed shock and sadness, while the community held vigils and showed solidarity. The shooting has reignited discussions about school safety and gun rights, with the NRA advocating for increased security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. END OF SUMMARY.
