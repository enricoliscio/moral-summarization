Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words the author used that carry a moral charge. Let me read through the article again to make sure I capture all the key points and the right tone.

First, the article is about a school shooting in Texas. A 17-year-old, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, killed 10 people, including Shana Fisher, who had rejected his advances. That's a strong moral element because it shows the motive behind the violence. The author uses words like "rampage," "murdering," and "massacre," which are heavy and convey the severity of the crime.

I need to include the details about the victims and the impact on the community. The vigils and the emotional state of the mourners are important, so words like "vigil," "attended," and "embraced" should be in the summary. Also, the aftermath with the NRA's response and the debate over gun control are morally charged topics, so I should mention that.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event, then move into the motive, the community's reaction, and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure to use as many of the author's moral words as possible without making the summary too lengthy.

Let me structure it: introduce the shooter and the victims, mention the motive, describe the community's response, and touch on the political debate. I'll end with the family's statement to show their perspective.

I think that covers all the key points while maintaining the moral framing. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and sticks to the main facts without adding unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of fatally shooting eight students and two teachers in a rampage at a Houston-area high school. One of his victims, Shana Fisher, had rejected his aggressive advances months prior, leading to the attack. Pagourtzis reportedly confessed to the killings but has not provided a motive. The incident, the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school, has sparked grief and anguish in the community. Vigils were held, with mourners attending emotional services and embracing each other for support. The shooting has also reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with the NRA advocating for school security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. Pagourtzisâ€™ family expressed sadness and dismay, stating they were as shocked as anyone by the events. Authorities confirmed the firearms were likely obtained legally from his father. END OF SUMMARY.
