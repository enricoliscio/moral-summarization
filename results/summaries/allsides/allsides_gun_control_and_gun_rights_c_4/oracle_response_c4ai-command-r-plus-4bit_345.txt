SUMMARY: Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old boy, has been charged with killing eight students and two teachers during a gun rampage at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter rejected four months of aggressive advances from Pagourtzis, who is accused of murdering 10 people during the attack. Fisher stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, and a week later he opened fire on everyone he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. Pagourtzis confessed to the killings but no motive has been determined yet. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. Mourners gathered at various vigils to console grieving victims and their families. This shooting has reignited debates about gun control and student safety, with NRA President Oliver North calling for more security measures in schools. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and that he wanted to commit suicide but lacked the courage. Pagourtzis' family expressed their sadness and dismay over the shooting.
