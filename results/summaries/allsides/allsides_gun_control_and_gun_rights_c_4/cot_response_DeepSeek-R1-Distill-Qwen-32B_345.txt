Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. 

The article is about a school shooting in Texas where a 17-year-old boy killed eight students and two teachers. The mother of one of the victims, Shana Fisher, mentioned that the shooter had made aggressive advances towards her daughter, who then stood up to him. This seems to be a key moral point about rejection leading to violence.

I should identify the morally framed words first. Words like "aggressive advances," "rejected," "embarrassed," "spurned," "massacre," "loner," "motive," "grief," "anguish," "prayers," "strong," "candles," "service dogs," "grieving," "rampage," "gun control," "pro-gun," "Second Amendment," "suicide," "saddened," "dismayed," and "shocked" all carry moral connotations.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words while keeping it concise. I'll start by stating the event, mention the shooter's actions, the victim's mother's account, the lack of motive from authorities, the school's denial of bullying, the shooter's description, the aftermath with vigils, the national debate on guns, the NRA's stance, the suspect's emotional state, and the governor's comments.

I have to ensure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. I'll structure it to cover the main points: the shooting, the possible motive, the school's response, the community's reaction, the gun control debate, the suspect's background, and the family's statement.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key morally framed words without making it too lengthy. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. 

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Let me review to ensure it's clear and preserves the moral framing as per the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is accused of killing eight students and two teachers at a Texas high school. The mother of one victim, Shana Fisher, claimed Pagourtzis had made aggressive advances toward her daughter, who rejected him. A week later, he allegedly opened fire, with Shana being the first victim. This incident follows a similar school shooting in Maryland, where a student killed a former partner. Authorities have not confirmed a motive, but Pagourtzis reportedly confessed to the killings. The school district denied claims that he had been bullied. Pagourtzis was described as a quiet loner who played football. The community held vigils, with service dogs helping the grieving. The shooting reignited the national debate over gun control, with the NRA advocating for school security measures rather than restricting Second Amendment rights. Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated Pagourtzis obtained firearms from his father and wanted to commit suicide but lacked the courage. Pagourtzis' family expressed shock and cooperation with authorities.
