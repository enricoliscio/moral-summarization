SUMMARY: A teenage boy has been charged with fatally shooting and killing eight students and two teachers in a gun rampage at a Houston-area high school. The boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, had been spurned by one of his victims, 16-year-old Shana Fisher, after making aggressive advances, her mother told a newspaper. Fisher's mother said her daughter rejected four months of aggressive advances from Pagourtzis, and that he opened fire on everyone he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. This is the second school shooting in recent months driven by such rejection. Pagourtzis has been accused of murdering 10 people and is currently in jail. Authorities have not yet offered a motive for the massacre, which is the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history. The community of Santa Fe is grieving, with many churches and businesses displaying messages of support. Mourners held a vigil to remember the victims, and service dogs were on hand to console grieving families. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Pagourtzis obtained the firearms from his father and that he wanted to commit suicide but lacked the courage. The suspect's family said they are cooperating with authorities and are as shocked as anyone else by the events.
END OF SUMMARY.
