SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, has been charged with fatally shooting ten people at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. Sadie Rodriguez, the mother of one of the victims, told the Los Angeles Times that her daughter, Shana Fisher, had rejected aggressive advances from Pagourtzis for four months before the shooting. Fisher eventually stood up to him, embarrassing him in class, after which Pagourtzis opened fire on those he didn't like, with Fisher being the first victim. Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the shooting, but it is the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school. The Santa Fe Independent School District denied claims that Pagourtzis had been bullied. The community of Santa Fe has come together to support the victims and their families, with many churches and businesses displaying messages of support. NRA President Oliver North has spoken out, saying that kids should be protected without taking away the rights of law-abiding citizens. Pagourtzis' family has expressed shock and dismay over the shooting and is cooperating with authorities.

END OF SUMMARY.
