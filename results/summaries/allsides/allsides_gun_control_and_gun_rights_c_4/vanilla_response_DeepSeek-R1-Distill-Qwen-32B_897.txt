Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. A 17-year-old boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, shot 10 people, including students and teachers. His motive might have been related to rejection from a girl he had been pursuing. Her mother mentioned that Shana Fisher rejected his advances, and then he killed her. 

I should note that this isn't the only recent school shooting linked to rejection; there was another in Maryland. The authorities haven't confirmed the motive yet, but the suspect confessed. The school district denied claims that he was bullied, and classmates described him as a quiet loner on the football team. 

After the shooting, there were vigils and support in the community. The incident has sparked debates about gun control, especially since the Parkland shooting. The NRA's president, Oliver North, suggested metal detectors and security assessments instead of limiting gun rights. The suspect's family is cooperating with authorities and expressed shock.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the main facts: who, what, when, where. Then mention the possible motive, the school's response, community reactions, and the debate on gun control. I'll make sure to include key points without getting too detailed.
