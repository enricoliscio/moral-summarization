SUMMARY: A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, went on a rampage at a Houston-area high school, fatally shooting eight students and two teachers. The attack was allegedly driven by rejection, as one of the victims, Shana Fisher, had spurned his aggressive advances four months prior. Fisher had finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, and a week later, Pagourtzis opened fire on everyone he didn't like, making Fisher the first victim. This massacre is the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history. Pagourtzis confessed to the killings after being taken into custody, but authorities have offered no motive yet. The community is grieving, with many attending vigils and emotional services to mourn the victims. The shooting has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter gun control measures. END OF SUMMARY.
