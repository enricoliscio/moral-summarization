SUMMARY:

A teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been charged with fatally shooting 10 people, including 8 students and 2 teachers, at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas. The motive behind the attack is believed to be rejection by one of his victims, Shana Fisher, 16, who had embarrassed him in class after rejecting his aggressive advances for four months. This incident is reminiscent of a similar school shooting in Maryland in March, where a 17-year-old boy killed a female student who had ended their relationship. The Santa Fe school district has denied claims that Pagourtzis was bullied, including by a football coach. The community is grieving, with many attending emotional services and vigils. The incident has reignited the national debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter gun control measures. The NRA, however, has suggested alternative solutions such as metal detectors in schools.
