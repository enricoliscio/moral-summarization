Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. They provided the full article, so I need to read through it and pick out the key points.

First, the main event is a teenage boy, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who is charged with killing eight students and two teachers. That's a lot, so I should note that it's the fourth-deadliest school shooting in US history. The article mentions that the suspect made aggressive advances towards one of his victims, Shana Fisher, who rejected him. Her mother told the newspaper about this, so that's an important detail linking his actions to rejection.

Then, the police say he confessed but haven't given a motive yet. The school district denied that he was bullied, which is another point to include. The suspect was described as a quiet loner on the football team, which adds to his profile.

After the shooting, the community's reaction is significant—churches and businesses showing support, vigils, and the impact on the families. It also touches on the national debate about gun control, referencing the NRA's stance and the previous shooting in Parkland.

Finally, the authorities are still investigating, and the suspect's family is cooperating. The governor mentioned the firearms came from his father, and Pagourtzis wanted to commit suicide but didn't have the courage.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main facts: the shooting, the suspect's background, the motive linked to rejection, community reaction, and the ongoing debate. I should ensure it's concise and covers all critical points without getting too detailed.

END OF SUMMARY.
