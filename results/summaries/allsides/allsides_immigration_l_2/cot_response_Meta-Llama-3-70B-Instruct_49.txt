SUMMARY:
Chicago's mayor is proud to announce that the city's immigrant and refugee communities are protected from ICE arrests, thanks to the new Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance. This ordinance bolsters the Welcoming City Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and ensures that ICE cannot request assistance from CPD for immigration enforcement operations. The mayor believes that the nation's strength lies in its diversity and that the values of hope, unity, and inclusion are sacred and need to be protected. The ordinance is a response to the current administration's cynical campaign against immigrants and refugees, which has led to fear and demonization. Chicago will continue to protect its communities and fight for the best of who it is, standing up for its neighbors and calling out division and demonization. END OF SUMMARY.
