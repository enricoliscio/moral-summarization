Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Chicago's response to ICE's reduced arrests in 2019. The deputy director of ICE came to Chicago to announce that their arrests fell because local officials didn't cooperate. The mayor is proud of their support for immigrants and refugees. They passed a new ordinance to strengthen the Welcoming City Ordinance, which was started in 1985.

The new ordinance stops ICE from accessing police databases and prohibits police from assisting ICE in immigration enforcement unless it's for serious crimes. It also sets up reporting requirements and legal guidance for public facilities. This makes Chicago's protections for immigrants stronger than before.

The article mentions that these measures were previously executive actions but are now laws. ICE's inability to reach their arrest goals is seen as a good thing by the city. They credit state leaders, local advocates, and programs like the TRUST Act and Community Navigators for helping undocumented families.

The mayor criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE against immigrants. They emphasize that immigration policy should be welcoming, not based on fear. The article ends by highlighting Chicago's commitment to unity, inclusion, and protecting their communities.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the ordinance, its impact on ICE, the city's support for immigrants, and the criticism of federal policies. I'll make sure to mention the key elements without getting too detailed.
