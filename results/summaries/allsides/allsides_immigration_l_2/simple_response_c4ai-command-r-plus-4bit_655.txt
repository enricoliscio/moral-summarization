SUMMARY: Chicago's Deputy Director of ICE announced a decrease in arrests due to local officials' refusal to cooperate with ICE. Mayor Lori Lightfoot reaffirms Chicago's commitment to protecting immigrant and refugee communities, citing the city's belief in diversity and inclusion. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance strengthens the Welcoming City Ordinance by prohibiting ICE from accessing CPD databases and limiting their collaboration. The ordinance maintains cooperation with federal authorities in rare cases of serious crimes, excluding immigration enforcement. Chicago's stance challenges the current administration's politicization of ICE and protects community trust in local police. While immigration policy is complex, the principle of not demonizing individuals for their identity remains straightforward. Chicago values its immigrant community for their contributions to the city's success. Moving forward, Chicago will continue to safeguard its communities, uphold its status as a Welcoming City, and advocate for unity, inclusion, and equity.

END OF SUMMARY.
