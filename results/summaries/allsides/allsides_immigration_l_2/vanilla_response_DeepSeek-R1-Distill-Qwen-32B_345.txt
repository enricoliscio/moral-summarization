Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Chicago's response to ICE's decreased arrests in 2019. The deputy director of ICE came to Chicago to announce that their arrests fell because local officials didn't cooperate. The mayor is proud of their support for immigrants and refugees. They passed a new ordinance to strengthen the Welcoming City Ordinance from 1985. This new law prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and restricts their ability to get help from the police. They also set up reporting requirements and legal guidance for public facilities. The mayor mentions that this doesn't affect serious crime investigations. They're codifying previous executive actions into law, making it more permanent. The ICE deputy director said Chicago's lack of cooperation caused their low arrest numbers, which the mayor sees as a good thing. They credit city and state leaders, local advocates, and the TRUST Act. The article also talks about the fear in immigrant communities due to the current administration's policies and how Chicago is working to protect them and maintain community trust. The mayor believes immigration policy should be about welcoming, not fear. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points like the ordinance, ICE's decreased arrests, cooperation issues, and the city's stance on immigration. I should make sure to highlight Chicago's proactive measures and the impact on immigrant communities.

SUMMARY: Chicago has taken significant steps to protect its immigrant communities by passing a new ordinance that restricts ICE's access to police databases and assistance from the Chicago Police Department. This move, which codifies previous executive actions into law, aims to bolster the city's Welcoming City Ordinance, established in 1985. The ordinance ensures that ICE cannot use CPD resources for immigration enforcement unless it aligns with city policies, and it establishes reporting requirements to monitor compliance. The city's proactive approach has led to a dramatic drop in ICE arrests in 2019, as local officials refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Mayor Lori Lightfoot emphasizes that immigration policy should prioritize unity, inclusion, and opportunity, rather than fear. Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants, including legal guidance for public facilities and community education, reflect its commitment to safeguarding its diverse population and maintaining trust between law enforcement and residents. END OF SUMMARY.
