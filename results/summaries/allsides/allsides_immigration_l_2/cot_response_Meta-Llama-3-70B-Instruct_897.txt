SUMMARY:
Chicago's mayor proudly announces the passage of the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which bolsters the city's Welcoming City Ordinance. This move is a direct response to the Trump administration's "cynical campaign against immigrants and refugees." The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and ensures that ICE cannot turn to CPD for assistance with immigration enforcement operations. The mayor believes that the nation's strength lies in its diversity and that the values of unity, inclusivity, and equity are sacred and need to be protected. The city's actions are a beacon of hope for immigrant and refugee communities, and the mayor vows to continue fighting for the best of who Chicago is. By standing up for its neighbors and calling out division and demonization, Chicago remains a Welcoming City that values transparency, accountability, and protection for all its residents.
