SUMMARY:
Chicago's mayor proudly announces that the city's arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have dramatically fallen in 2019 due to the city's "unequivocal support" of immigrant and refugee communities. The mayor attributes this decline to the city's "sacred" values of diversity and inclusivity, which are enshrined in the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance. This ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and ensures that ICE cannot request assistance from CPD for immigration enforcement operations. The mayor believes that cities like Chicago should not have to "butt heads" with federal agencies to keep families safe and communities whole. Instead, the country should be crafting immigration policy based on welcoming new residents with clear pathways to citizenship, not fear of arrests. The mayor vows to continue protecting Chicago's communities, strengthening its status as a Welcoming City, and fighting for unity, equity, and opportunity.
