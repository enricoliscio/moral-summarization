SUMMARY:

The City of Chicago has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which strengthens the city's Welcoming City Ordinance and limits ICE's access to police databases and assistance from the Chicago Police Department. This move is a direct response to the Trump administration's "cynical campaign against immigrants and refugees." The ordinance ensures that ICE cannot use CPD resources for immigration enforcement and establishes reporting requirements to ensure compliance. The mayor proudly notes that this move is a testament to the city's commitment to diversity and its values of unity, inclusion, and opportunity. The ordinance does not inhibit law enforcement's ability to investigate serious crimes, but rather protects immigrant communities from ICE raids. The mayor emphasizes that cities should not have to "butt heads" with federal agencies to keep families safe, and that national immigration policy should focus on welcoming new residents with clear pathways to citizenship, rather than fear and demonization.
