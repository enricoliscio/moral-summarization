Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Chicago's response to ICE's reduced arrests because local officials didn't cooperate. The mayor is proud of their support for immigrants and refugees, highlighting their values of diversity and hope. They passed an ordinance to limit ICE's access to police databases and assistance, ensuring transparency and protection. They also mention the negative impact of the current administration's policies, which have led to fear among immigrant families. The summary needs to include morally framed words like "strength," "diversity," "values," "hope," "protection," "rights," "trust," "unity," "inclusion," "equity," and "opportunity."

I should start by identifying all the single morally framed words in the article. Then, craft a concise summary that includes these words, keeping it under 200 words. I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's moral stance, emphasizing Chicago's commitment to protecting immigrants and their values.

I'll first list out the morally framed words. Then, structure the summary to highlight Chicago's actions, the impact on ICE arrests, the reasons behind their policies, and the broader moral implications. I'll ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the problem, then the solution, and ending with the values upheld.
