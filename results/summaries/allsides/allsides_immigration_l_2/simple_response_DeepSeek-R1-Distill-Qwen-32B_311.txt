Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants and their impact on ICE arrests. The mayor is proud of supporting immigrant communities, which is tied to the city's values of diversity and inclusion. 

I should start by identifying the key points: the decrease in ICE arrests, the new ordinance passed, the measures it includes like prohibiting ICE access to police databases, and the moral stance against demonizing immigrants. The author emphasizes that Chicago is taking a stand against federal policies that target immigrants, highlighting the city's commitment to unity and inclusion.

I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral perspective, such as the sacredness of diversity and the importance of protecting immigrants. Also, mention the consequences of federal actions, like children fearing their parents' arrest, to highlight the human impact.

I'll structure the summary to first state the main event (ICE arrests dropping), then explain the measures Chicago took, and finally touch on the moral and human aspects. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure it's concise but captures all essential elements with the author's tone.

SUMMARY: Chicago has taken a strong stance in protecting its immigrant communities, leading to a significant drop in ICE arrests in 2019. The city passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing local police databases and restricts their ability to collaborate on immigration enforcement. This move reflects Chicago's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and human dignity, countering federal policies that have politicized immigration enforcement. The ordinance ensures community trust in local law enforcement while maintaining cooperation in rare cases of criminal investigations. The city's efforts, including educational outreach and legal support, aim to safeguard immigrants and uphold the principle that no one should be demonized for their identity. Chicago's actions highlight the importance of unity and inclusion, emphasizing the need for immigration policies based on welcome rather than fear. The human cost of current federal actions, such as children fearing their parents' arrest, underscores the moral imperative to protect vulnerable communities. END OF SUMMARY.
