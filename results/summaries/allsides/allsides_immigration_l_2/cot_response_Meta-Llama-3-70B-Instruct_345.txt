SUMMARY:
Chicago's mayor proudly announced that the city's arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have dramatically fallen in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate. This is a result of the city's "unequivocal support" for immigrant and refugee communities, which is rooted in the belief that diversity is a strength and that sacred values need to be protected. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and ensures that ICE cannot use local police for immigration enforcement. This move is a major expansion of immigrant protections and a testament to the city's commitment to being a "Welcoming City". The mayor emphasizes that immigration policy should be based on welcoming new residents, not fear and demonization. END OF SUMMARY.
