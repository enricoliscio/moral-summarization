Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The deputy director of ICE came to Chicago to announce a drop in arrests because local officials didn't cooperate. The mayor is proud of supporting immigrants and refugees, believing in diversity and the sacred values that make America strong. They passed an ordinance to bolster protections, prohibiting ICE from accessing police databases and requiring transparency. They also established reporting requirements and legal guidance to protect immigrants. The measures don't affect serious crime investigations. The article mentions that these actions were previously executive orders but are now codified into law, providing more protections. ICE's inability to meet arrest goals is seen as a good thing, showing the city's success in protecting its communities. The author criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE against immigrants and emphasizes the importance of unity, inclusion, and equity.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list and incorporate them into the summary. Words like support, sacred, protected, bolster, prohibit, establish, protect, targeted, safe, whole, demonized, welcoming, inclusion, equity, division, and ensure are key.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Chicago's proactive stance, the new ordinance, the impact on ICE's operations, and the broader moral implications. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to convey the author's perspective effectively.

I should keep each sentence concise, ensuring the summary flows logically from the city's actions to the impact and the moral stance against federal policies. I'll avoid any technical jargon and focus on the ethical and protective measures taken by Chicago.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes as many of the specified moral words as possible.

SUMMARY:  
The deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently highlighted a significant drop in Chicago-area arrests in 2019, attributing it to local officials' refusal to cooperate. Chicago's mayor emphasized the city's commitment to supporting immigrant and refugee communities, viewing diversity and inclusion as sacred values. To strengthen protections, the city passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requires transparency in any requests for assistance. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrants from ICE raids. These measures do not hinder investigations into serious crimes like counterterrorism, trafficking, or money laundering. Chicago has codified its previous executive actions into law, expanding immigrant protections significantly. The city's efforts have successfully limited ICE's ability to meet its arrest goals, a result celebrated as a positive outcome. However, the author criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE into a campaign against immigrants, leading to fear and division. Chicago remains committed to unity, equity, and inclusion, ensuring its status as a welcoming city and protecting its communities from harm. END OF SUMMARY.
