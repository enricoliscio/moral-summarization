Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants and how it's affecting ICE arrests. 

The deputy director of ICE came to Chicago to announce that arrests dropped because local officials didn't cooperate. The mayor is proud of supporting immigrants and refugees, emphasizing diversity and hope. They passed a new ordinance to strengthen the Welcoming City Ordinance from 1985. 

The key points of the ordinance are: prohibiting ICE from accessing police databases, not allowing ICE to use CPD for immigration enforcement, requiring supervisors to verify ICE's requests, and setting up reporting requirements. It also provides legal guidance to protect immigrants during raids. Importantly, it doesn't affect serious crime investigations or certain federal agreements. 

The article mentions that these measures were previously executive actions but are now codified into law, expanding protections. The ICE deputy director acknowledged Chicago's lack of cooperation led to fewer arrests, which is seen as a positive outcome. 

The mayor also talks about the collaboration with state leaders and local advocates, like the TRUST Act and community navigators. Despite the success, the situation shouldn't be this way, as it's due to the federal administration's actions against immigrants. 

The article emphasizes that immigration policy should be about welcoming, not fear, and that immigrants contribute to the city's success. The fear among children is highlighted as a problem. The conclusion is about continuing to protect communities and uphold values of unity and inclusion.

So, the summary should cover the ordinance, its provisions, the impact on ICE arrests, the collaborative efforts, and the underlying principles. It needs to be concise, under 200 words, and structured clearly.
