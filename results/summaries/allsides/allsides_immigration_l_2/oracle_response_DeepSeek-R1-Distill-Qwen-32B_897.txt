Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author talks about Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants by limiting ICE's access to local databases and passing new ordinances. They emphasize values like unity, inclusion, and protecting vulnerable communities. 

I should identify the key morally framed words the author used, such as "support," "sacred," "protected," etc. I need to include these terms in the summary to maintain the moral tone. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, so I'll focus on the main actions taken by Chicago and the reasons behind them, highlighting the moral stance against ICE's policies.

I'll structure the summary to first state Chicago's actions, then explain the impact on ICE arrests, and finally discuss the broader implications and values they uphold. I'll make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral framing as required.

SUMMARY:  
The article highlights Chicago's efforts to protect its immigrant and refugee communities by limiting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Mayor Lori Lightfoot and local leaders have taken decisive actions, including passing the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, to prohibit ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and seeking assistance for immigration enforcement. These measures aim to protect immigrants from ICE raids and ensure community safety. The city has also established reporting requirements and legal guidance to safeguard immigrants, while maintaining the ability to address serious crimes. Chicago's actions reflect a commitment to unity, inclusion, and equity, countering federal policies that have politicized ICE and created fear among undocumented families. The city's efforts underscore the principle that no one should be demonized for their identity, and immigration policy should prioritize welcoming newcomers rather than fostering fear. By codifying protections, Chicago reaffirms its role as a Welcoming City, standing up for its values and ensuring a safe and inclusive future for all.  
END OF SUMMARY.
