SUMMARY:

Chicago's mayor proudly announces that the city's ICE arrests have dramatically fallen in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate with ICE. This is a result of the city's unequivocal support for immigrant and refugee communities, which is rooted in the belief that diversity is a strength and a beacon of hope. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and requires CPD supervisors to verify ICE requests. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrant patrons. The mayor argues that cities shouldn't have to "butt heads" with federal agencies to keep families safe and communities whole, and that immigration policy should be based on welcoming newcomers with clear pathways to citizenship, not fear of arrests. The city will continue to protect its communities and fight for unity, inclusion, and equity.

END OF SUMMARY.
