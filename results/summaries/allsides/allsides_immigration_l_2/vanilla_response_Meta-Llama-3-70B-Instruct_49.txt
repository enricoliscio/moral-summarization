SUMMARY:

The Deputy Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced that ICE arrests in the Chicago area have fallen dramatically in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot proudly stated that the city's "unequivocal support" for immigrant and refugee communities is behind this decline. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which bolsters the Welcoming City Ordinance, prohibiting ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requiring CPD supervisors to confirm ICE requests do not support immigration enforcement. The ordinance aims to protect immigrant communities while still allowing law enforcement to pursue serious crimes. Lightfoot believes that cities should not have to work against federal agencies to keep families safe and that immigration policy should be based on welcoming new residents with clear pathways to citizenship, rather than fear of arrests.

END OF SUMMARY.
