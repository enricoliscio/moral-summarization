SUMMARY: Chicago's deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a significant drop in ICE arrests in the city in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate. The city's mayor reaffirmed Chicago's support for its immigrant and refugee communities, citing the belief that diversity strengthens the nation. To further protect these communities, the city passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, enhancing the Welcoming City Ordinance established in 1985. The new ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and mandates reporting requirements to ensure compliance with immigrant-protective policies. Chicago's stance against ICE cooperation stems from the current administration's politicization of ICE and its negative impact on community trust in law enforcement. The mayor emphasizes the complexity of immigration policy but asserts that no one should be demonized for their identity. Chicago's diverse immigrant population contributes to its success, and the nation should focus on creating welcoming policies with clear paths to citizenship. The city will continue to protect its communities and uphold its values of unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity.
END OF SUMMARY.
