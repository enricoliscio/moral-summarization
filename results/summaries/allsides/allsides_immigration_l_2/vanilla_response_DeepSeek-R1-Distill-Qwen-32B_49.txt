Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Chicago's response to ICE's reduced arrests in 2019. The deputy director of ICE mentioned that local officials didn't cooperate. Chicago's mayor is proud of their support for immigrants and refugees. They passed an ordinance to strengthen their Welcoming City policy, which includes prohibiting ICE from accessing police databases and requiring supervisor approval for any ICE requests. They also established reporting requirements and legal guidance for public facilities.

The article also mentions that these measures were previously executive actions but are now codified into law, expanding immigrant protections. ICE's inability to meet arrest goals is seen as a positive outcome. The mayor credits city and state leaders, local advocates, and the TRUST Act for this success. However, the mayor criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE and causing fear among immigrants. They emphasize that immigration policy should be welcoming, not fear-based, and that Chicago's actions protect community trust and effectiveness of local police.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll focus on the key points: Chicago's ordinance, its impact on ICE arrests, the expansion of protections, and the criticism of federal policies. I should make sure the summary is concise and captures the essence without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Chicago has strengthened its protections for immigrants by codifying its Welcoming City Ordinance into law, prohibiting ICE from accessing police databases and requiring supervisor approval for any ICE requests. This move, which builds on previous executive actions, aims to protect immigrant communities and maintain trust with local law enforcement. ICE's reduced arrest numbers in 2019 were attributed to Chicago's lack of cooperation. The ordinance ensures that immigration enforcement does not interfere with efforts to combat serious crimes. The city also criticized the federal administration for politicizing ICE, leading to fear among undocumented families. Chicago's actions reflect a commitment to unity, inclusion, and welcoming immigrants, rather than demonizing them. END OF SUMMARY.
