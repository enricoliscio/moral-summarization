SUMMARY: Chicago's mayor expressed *pride* in the city's *support* of its immigrant and refugee communities, rooted in the *belief* that diversity is a source of strength and that *sacred* values, such as *hope*, *unity*, *inclusion*, *equity*, and *opportunity*, must be safeguarded. Efforts to educate residents about their rights and build *trust* with immigrant communities were highlighted, countering the federal government's politicization of ICE and its *demonization* of immigrants. Chicago's commitment to protecting its residents and maintaining its status as a *Welcoming City* was emphasized, along with the belief that immigration policy should focus on clear pathways to citizenship rather than fear of arrests. The city's *competitive* edge and *success* were attributed in part to its diverse immigrant population, with a call for a more inclusive national immigration discourse. Chicago's stance challenges the current administration's stance on immigration, prioritizing the protection of its communities and upholding its moral values. END OF SUMMARY.
