Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Chicago's response to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. The deputy director of ICE noted a significant drop in arrests in the Chicago area in 2019 because local officials refused to cooperate. Mayor Lori Lightfoot is proud of their support for immigrants and refugees, emphasizing diversity and the city's values.

They passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which strengthens the Welcoming City Ordinance. This ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and restricts ICE's ability to get help from the Chicago Police Department for immigration enforcement. It also includes reporting requirements and legal guidance for public facilities to protect immigrants during ICE raids.

The mayor points out that this doesn't hinder law enforcement from pursuing serious crimes. They've codified previous executive actions into law, expanding protections for immigrants. The article criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE against immigrants, leading to fear in communities.

Chicago's efforts are seen as a stand for unity, inclusion, and against demonization. The article highlights the contributions of immigrants to the city and criticizes the current administration's approach to immigration.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects like support for immigrants, criticism of federal policies, and the importance of unity and inclusion.

I'll start by mentioning the ICE announcement, the drop in arrests due to local resistance. Then, outline the new ordinance's measures, emphasizing the moral stance against ICE's actions. Highlight the city's values, the contributions of immigrants, and the criticism of federal policies. Conclude with the city's commitment to unity and inclusion.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key moral points without being too technical. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence captures a main idea without exceeding the word limit.

It also establishes reporting requirements and legal guidance to protect immigrants from ICE raids. The ordinance ensures that law enforcement can still target serious crimes but explicitly excludes immigration enforcement. Chicago's actions reflect a commitment to protecting immigrant communities and upholding values of diversity, unity, and inclusion. The city criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE and creating fear among undocumented families. By codifying these protections, Chicago reaffirms its role as a beacon of hope and a welcoming city, emphasizing the importance of immigration policies based on inclusion rather than fear.
