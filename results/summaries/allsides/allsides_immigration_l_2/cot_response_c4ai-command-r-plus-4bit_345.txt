Chicago aims to safeguard its communities, maintain its status as a Welcoming City, and uphold the values of *unity*, *inclusion*, *equity*, and *opportunity*. The city recognizes the contributions of immigrants in driving its *success* and preserving its rich *heritage*. Chicago will continue to *welcome* its newest residents, foster *trust*, and provide *education* and *empowerment*. The mayor concludes by highlighting Chicago's commitment to standing up for its neighbors and calling out *division* and *demonization*. These values, the mayor asserts, are integral to Chicago's *competitive* edge and its reputation as one of the best cities in the world. END OF SUMMARY.
