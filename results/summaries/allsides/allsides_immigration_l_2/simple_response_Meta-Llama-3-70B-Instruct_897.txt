SUMMARY:

Chicago's mayor proudly announces that the city's ICE arrests have dramatically fallen in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate with ICE. This is a result of the city's unequivocal support for immigrant and refugee communities, which is rooted in the belief that diversity is the nation's strength. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and requires CPD supervisors to confirm ICE requests. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on how to protect immigrant patrons. The mayor emphasizes that the city's actions are necessary due to the current administration's politicization of ICE into a campaign against immigrants and refugees. The city's values of unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity will continue to guide its actions in protecting its communities.
