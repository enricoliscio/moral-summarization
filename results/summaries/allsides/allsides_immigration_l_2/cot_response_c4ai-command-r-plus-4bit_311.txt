SUMMARY: Chicago's mayor expresses their support for the city's immigrant and refugee communities, highlighting the belief that diversity is a strength and that values such as support, pride, and protection are sacred. The city has taken steps to bolster its Welcoming City Ordinance by prohibiting ICE from accessing local police databases and making clear that ICE cannot rely on the CPD for immigration enforcement operations. These measures, now codified into law, aim to protect immigrant families and communities, ensuring they are treated with fairness and respect. The mayor acknowledges the complexity of immigration policy but emphasizes that no one should be demonized for who they are. Chicago's immigrants have always been integral to the city's success, helping to build its competitive edge and drive its economy. The city stands for unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity, calling out division and demonization while standing up for its neighbors. These values have endowed Chicago with a rich heritage and will continue to ensure its success as the best city in the world to call home. END OF SUMMARY.
