Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it first.

The article is about Chicago's response to ICE's reduced arrests in 2019. The mayor is proud of supporting immigrants and refugees, emphasizing diversity and hope. They passed an ordinance to limit ICE's access to police databases and assistance. It's a big expansion of protections, making previous executive actions into law. The ICE deputy director says Chicago's lack of cooperation caused the drop in arrests, which the mayor sees as a positive thing. They credit city leaders and advocates, like the TRUST Act and community navigators. The article criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE against immigrants, which has led to fear in communities. The mayor argues that immigration policy should be about welcoming, not fear, and that Chicago will keep protecting its communities based on unity and inclusion.

I need to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should highlight Chicago's proactive stance, the new ordinance, the impact on ICE arrests, the criticism of federal policies, and the emphasis on values like unity and inclusion. Make sure to mention the positive outcomes and the moral stance against demonizing immigrants.

Let me structure it: start with Chicago's action, the ordinance details, the result in ICE arrests, credit to local efforts, criticism of federal policies, and the call for welcoming immigration policies. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Chicago has taken a strong stance in protecting its immigrant and refugee communities by passing a new ordinance that limits ICE's access to police databases and assistance. This move, which codifies previous executive actions into law, has led to a significant drop in ICE arrests in the Chicago area in 2019. The ordinance ensures that ICE cannot use CPD resources for immigration enforcement unless specific conditions are met, while still allowing cooperation in rare cases of serious crimes. The city credits this success to local leaders, advocates, and policies like the TRUST Act, which have helped protect undocumented families. The mayor criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE and creating fear among immigrant communities. Chicago's approach emphasizes unity, inclusion, and welcoming newcomers, rejecting policies based on fear and demonization. The city remains committed to protecting its communities and upholding its values of diversity and hope. END OF SUMMARY.
