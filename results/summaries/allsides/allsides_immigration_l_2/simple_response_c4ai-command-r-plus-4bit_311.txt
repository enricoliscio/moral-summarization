SUMMARY: Chicago's deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a significant drop in ICE arrests in the city in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate with ICE. Mayor Lori Lightfoot attributes this to Chicago's unwavering support for its immigrant and refugee communities, rooted in the belief that diversity is a source of strength and that welcoming values must be protected. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, strengthening the Welcoming City Ordinance established in 1985. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and seeking assistance from the police department for immigration enforcement. It also mandates reporting on compliance and provides legal guidance to public facilities on protecting immigrants during ICE raids. These measures ensure community trust and effective local policing while maintaining the ability to address serious crimes and collaborate with federal authorities on specific investigations, excluding immigration enforcement. Chicago's stance against ICE's politicized campaigns sends a clear message: no one should be demonized for who they are. The city values its diverse immigrant communities and recognizes their contributions to its success. Moving forward, Chicago remains committed to protecting its communities, upholding its welcoming values, and fighting for unity, inclusion, and equity.
