SUMMARY: Chicago's deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a significant drop in ICE arrests in 2019 due to the city's refusal to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The city's mayor reaffirms Chicago's support for its immigrant and refugee communities, citing the belief in diversity and the protection of values that make the nation a beacon of hope. The city passes the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, strengthening the Welcoming City Ordinance established in 1985. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and mandates reporting requirements to ensure compliance. Chicago's stance challenges the current administration's politicization of ICE and demonstrates the complexity of immigration policy. The mayor emphasizes that Chicago's strength lies in its diverse immigrant communities and advocates for a welcoming approach to immigration with clear pathways to citizenship. Chicago's actions protect communities, uphold values, and contribute to the city's success.
