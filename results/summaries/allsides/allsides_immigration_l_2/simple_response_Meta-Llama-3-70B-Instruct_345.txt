SUMMARY:

The City of Chicago has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which strengthens its Welcoming City Ordinance and limits ICE's access to city resources. This move is a proud moment for the city, as it reaffirms its commitment to protecting immigrant and refugee communities. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requires CPD supervisors to verify ICE requests. It also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities. This effort is a direct response to the Trump administration's anti-immigrant policies, which have sought to demonize and scare undocumented families. Chicago's stance is rooted in its belief that diversity is a strength and that all individuals deserve respect and protection. The city will continue to fight for unity, inclusion, and equity, and stand up against division and demonization.

END OF SUMMARY.
