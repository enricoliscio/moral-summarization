SUMMARY:

Chicago's Mayor proudly announces the passage of the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which bolsters the city's Welcoming City Ordinance. This move prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and ensures that ICE cannot request CPD assistance for immigration enforcement operations without confirmation of truthfulness. The ordinance establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. This measure codifies previous executive actions, making it one of the largest expansions of immigrant protections in Chicago in over 30 years. The Mayor attributes the decline in ICE arrests to the city's lack of cooperation, which is a good thing. The Mayor emphasizes that cities shouldn't have to butt heads with federal agencies to keep families safe and communities whole. The current administration's politicization of ICE has created a cynical campaign against immigrants and refugees, demonizing them for who they are. Chicago will continue to protect its communities, strengthen its status as a Welcoming City, and fight for unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity. END OF SUMMARY.
