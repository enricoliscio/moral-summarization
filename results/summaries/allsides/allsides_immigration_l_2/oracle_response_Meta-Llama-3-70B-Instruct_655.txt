SUMMARY:

Chicago's mayor proudly announces that the city's arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have dramatically fallen in 2019, thanks to the city's "unequivocal support" of immigrant and refugee communities. The mayor attributes this decline to the city's refusal to cooperate with ICE, citing the importance of protecting the city's diversity and sacred values. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which bolsters the Welcoming City Ordinance and prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and requesting assistance with immigration enforcement operations. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on how to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. The mayor believes that cities should not have to "butt heads" with federal agencies to keep families safe and communities whole, and that immigration policy should be based on welcoming new residents with clear pathways to citizenship, not fear of arrests. The city will continue to protect its communities, strengthen its status as a Welcoming City, and fight for unity, inclusion, and equity.

END OF SUMMARY.
