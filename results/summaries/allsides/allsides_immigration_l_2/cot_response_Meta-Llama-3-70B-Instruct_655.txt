SUMMARY:
The city of Chicago has taken a strong stance in support of its immigrant and refugee communities, refusing to cooperate with ICE arrests. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, passed by the City Council, prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requires CPD supervisors to confirm the truthfulness of ICE requests. This ordinance is a major expansion of immigrant protections in Chicago, making it a beacon of hope for those seeking a welcoming community. The city's actions are a direct response to the current administration's cynical campaign against immigrants and refugees, which has led to a climate of fear and demonization. By standing up for its neighbors and fighting for unity and inclusion, Chicago remains a shining example of the values that have made it a strong and diverse city. END OF SUMMARY.
