SUMMARY: Chicago's Deputy Director of ICE announced a decrease in arrests due to a lack of cooperation from local officials, a stance Mayor Lori Lightfoot attributes to the city's support for its immigrant communities and commitment to diversity. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance strengthens Chicago's Welcoming City Ordinance by prohibiting ICE from accessing CPD databases and limiting their collaboration. The ordinance protects immigrant families without inhibiting law enforcement's ability to address serious crimes or compromising agreements with federal authorities. Chicago's stance challenges the current administration's politicization of ICE and its negative impact on community trust and effective policing. While immigration policy is complex, demonizing immigrants is unacceptable. Chicago values its immigrant communities for their contributions to the city's success and advocates for welcoming policies with clear paths to citizenship. The fear experienced by children highlights the urgent need for change. Chicago remains committed to protecting its communities, upholding its values, and fostering unity and inclusion.
END OF SUMMARY.
