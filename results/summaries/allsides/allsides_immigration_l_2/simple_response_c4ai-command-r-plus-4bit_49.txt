SUMMARY: Chicago's deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a significant drop in ICE arrests in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate. Mayor Lori Lightfoot attributes this to Chicago's unwavering support for its immigrant and refugee communities, rooted in the belief that diversity is a strength and that welcoming values must be protected. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, strengthening the Welcoming City Ordinance established by Mayor Harold Washington. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and clarifies that CPD will not assist in immigration enforcement operations. It also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrants from ICE raids. Mayor Lightfoot emphasizes that Chicago's actions are a response to the current administration's politicization of ICE and its negative impact on community trust. She asserts that while immigration policy is complex, demonizing individuals for their identity is unacceptable. Chicago's immigrants contribute to the city's success, and the nation should focus on creating welcoming policies with clear paths to citizenship. The city will continue to protect its communities and stand against division and demonization.
END OF SUMMARY.
