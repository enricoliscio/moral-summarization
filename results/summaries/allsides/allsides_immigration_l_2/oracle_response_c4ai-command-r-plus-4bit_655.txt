SUMMARY: Chicago's deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a significant drop in ICE arrests in the city in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate. The city's commitment to supporting and protecting its immigrant and refugee communities stems from the belief in the sacredness of diversity and the need to bolster the Welcoming City Ordinance. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing CPD databases and mandates that CPD cannot assist in immigration enforcement operations. It also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on protecting immigrants from ICE raids. These measures ensure that law enforcement can focus on serious or violent crimes while maintaining agreements with federal authorities for rare occasions of investigating criminal enterprises. Chicago's stance is a direct response to the current administration's politicization of ICE and the demonization of immigrants. The city recognizes the complexities of immigration policy but stands for unity, inclusion, and equity, protecting its communities and welcoming its newest residents with clear paths to citizenship rather than fear of arrests. Chicago is proud to be a leader in protecting immigrant families and strengthening its status as a welcoming city.
