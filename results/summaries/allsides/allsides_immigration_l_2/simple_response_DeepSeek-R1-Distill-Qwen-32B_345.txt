Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants and their conflict with ICE. I need to make sure the summary highlights the city's stance and the moral implications.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Chicago's mayor is proud of supporting immigrants, passed new ordinances to restrict ICE access, and this led to fewer ICE arrests. They're also criticizing the federal government for politicizing immigration enforcement.

I need to capture the moral angle: Chicago stands for inclusion and against demonization. The summary should reflect their values and the impact on the community, like the fear among children.

I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, focusing on key measures, the outcome, and the underlying principles. Make sure to mention the collaboration with local advocates and the broader implications for immigration policy.

Let me structure it: start with the announcement, then the measures taken, the result, and the moral stance against federal actions. Conclude with Chicago's commitment to unity and inclusion.

Double-checking to ensure all main points are included without losing the moral framing. That should cover the user's requirements.
