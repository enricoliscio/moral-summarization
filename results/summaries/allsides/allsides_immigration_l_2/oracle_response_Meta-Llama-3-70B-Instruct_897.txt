SUMMARY:

The City of Chicago has taken a strong stance in support of its immigrant and refugee communities, refusing to cooperate with ICE arrests. This decision is rooted in the belief that diversity is a strength and that sacred values of hope and protection must be upheld. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, passed by the City Council, bolsters the Welcoming City Ordinance, prohibiting ICE from accessing police databases and requiring CPD supervisors to confirm ICE requests are truthful and not supporting immigration enforcement. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. This move is a significant expansion of immigrant protections, ensuring that Chicago remains a beacon of hope and inclusion. The city's actions are a direct response to the current administration's politicized campaign against immigrants and refugees, which has created fear and division. By standing up for its neighbors and calling out demonization, Chicago reaffirms its commitment to unity, equity, and opportunity. END OF SUMMARY.
