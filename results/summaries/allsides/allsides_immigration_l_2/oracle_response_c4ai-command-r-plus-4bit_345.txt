SUMMARY: On Friday, the deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a significant drop in Chicago-area ICE arrests in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate. Chicago's mayor reaffirms the city's support for its immigrant and refugee communities, citing the nation's strength in its diversity. The city passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance to bolster the Welcoming City Ordinance, prohibiting ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and restricting their involvement in immigration enforcement operations. The ordinance protects immigrant families while maintaining the ability to investigate serious crimes. Chicago's stance is a direct response to the current administration's politicization of ICE and its negative impact on community trust. The mayor emphasizes the complexity of immigration policy but stresses the principle of not demonizing individuals for who they are. Chicago values its immigrant communities and their contributions to the city's success. The protection of immigrant families and the fight against fear and division are paramount in ensuring Chicago remains a welcoming city.

END OF SUMMARY.
