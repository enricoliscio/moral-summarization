SUMMARY: Chicago's mayor recently announced a new ordinance designed to bolster the city's Welcoming City Ordinance and protect immigrant communities. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing local police databases and clarifies that ICE cannot rely on the Chicago Police Department for assistance with immigration enforcement operations. It also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on protecting immigrants from ICE raids. These measures are intended to protect immigrant families and communities while still allowing law enforcement to investigate serious or violent crimes. The mayor acknowledges the complexity of immigration policy but emphasizes the importance of welcoming immigrants and providing clear pathways to citizenship, rather than demonizing and fearing them. Chicago's diverse immigrant communities have always contributed to the city's success and should be supported and protected. The current administration's politicization of ICE and its campaign against immigrants are criticized, with the mayor highlighting the need to educate residents about their rights and build community trust. Chicago will continue to stand up for its values of unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity, ensuring it remains a welcoming city and the best place to call home.
END OF SUMMARY.
