Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants despite ICE's decreased arrests. The mayor is proud of supporting immigrants, which they see as a sacred value. They passed an ordinance to bolster their welcoming policies, prohibiting ICE access to police databases and requiring truthful requests. They also established reporting and legal guidance to protect immigrants from raids. The summary should include key morally framed words like support, sacred, protected, bolster, prohibit, etc. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main actions and the moral stance against ICE's policies. I'll structure it to highlight Chicago's proactive measures and their commitment to unity and inclusion.

SUMMARY: Chicago has taken a firm stance to protect its immigrant and refugee communities, as highlighted by the recent passage of the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance. This ordinance bolsters the city's Welcoming City Ordinance, prohibiting ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requiring CPD to confirm the truthfulness of ICE requests before assisting. The measures also establish reporting requirements and provide legal guidance to protect immigrants from ICE raids. Mayor Lori Lightfoot emphasized that these actions do not hinder law enforcement's ability to target serious crimes, ensuring a balance between public safety and immigrant protections. The ordinance codifies previous executive actions, marking a significant expansion of immigrant protections in Chicago. The city's efforts have led to a decline in ICE arrests, a result of local officials refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The author criticized the federal administration for politizing ICE into a campaign against immigrants, calling for immigration policies based on welcoming newcomers rather than fear. Chicago's actions reflect its commitment to unity, inclusion, equity, and standing against division and demonization, ensuring the city remains a beacon of hope and a welcoming home for all. END OF SUMMARY.
