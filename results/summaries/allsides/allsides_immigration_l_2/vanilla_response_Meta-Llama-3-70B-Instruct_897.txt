SUMMARY:

The City of Chicago has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which strengthens the city's Welcoming City Ordinance. The new ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and prohibits CPD from assisting ICE with immigration enforcement operations. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on how to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. This move has led to a significant decline in ICE arrests in the Chicago area, which ICE officials attribute to the city's lack of cooperation. The mayor of Chicago proudly stands by the city's commitment to protecting its immigrant and refugee communities, citing the importance of diversity and inclusivity. The mayor argues that the current administration has politicized ICE, leading to a campaign against immigrants and refugees, and that cities like Chicago should not have to fight to keep their families safe.

END OF SUMMARY.
