SUMMARY: On Friday, the deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a significant drop in Chicago-area ICE arrests in 2019 due to a lack of cooperation from local officials. Chicago's mayor reaffirms the city's support for its immigrant and refugee communities, citing the recent passage of the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance. This ordinance strengthens the city's Welcoming City Ordinance by prohibiting ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and limiting their collaboration. The mayor emphasizes that these measures protect immigrant families without hindering law enforcement's ability to address serious crimes. Chicago's stance against ICE's actions aligns with its values of unity, inclusion, and equity, and the belief that diversity is a source of strength. The city aims to protect its communities and uphold its status as a welcoming city, fostering an environment where immigrants contribute to its growth and success.
