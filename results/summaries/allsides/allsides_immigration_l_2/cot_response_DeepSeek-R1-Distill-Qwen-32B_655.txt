Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the task. The user wants me to identify morally framed single words and then write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants, leading to a decrease in ICE arrests. The mayor is proud of supporting immigrants and refugees, which are morally positive terms. The article mentions values like diversity, hope, trust, unity, inclusion, equity, opportunity, and standing up for neighbors. These are all morally framed words that highlight the positive stance Chicago is taking.

I need to extract all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "proud," "support," "values," "beacon of hope," "sacred," "prohibit," "protect," "transparency," "fairness," "justice," "compassion," "empathy," "equality," "respect," "unity," "inclusion," "equity," "opportunity," "demonize," "afraid," "missing," "indictment," "success," "best," and "home." These words are key to the moral framing of the article.

Now, for the summary, I should condense the article, focusing on the main points: Chicago's policies, the decrease in ICE arrests, the moral stance against ICE's actions, and the positive impact on the community. I'll make sure to include as many of the identified moral words as possible without making the summary too long.

I should start by stating the decrease in arrests due to Chicago's policies. Then mention the moral principles they stand for, like diversity and inclusion. Highlight the new ordinance and its protective measures. Emphasize the contrast with federal actions and the values Chicago upholds. Conclude with the impact on community trust and the call for a welcoming immigration policy.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the essential moral elements. Make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's tone and message.

**SUMMARY:**  
Chicago’s efforts to protect its immigrant and refugee communities have led to a significant decline in ICE arrests in 2019, as local officials refused to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The city has enshrined its commitment to diversity and inclusion through the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and restricts immigration enforcement. This policy reflects Chicago’s values of fairness, justice, and compassion, ensuring community trust and safety. The ordinance codifies protections for immigrants, building on decades of pro-immigrant policies. While ICE’s inability to meet its arrest goals is seen as a positive outcome, the situation highlights the national divide over immigration. Chicago remains a beacon of hope, emphasizing unity, equity, and opportunity for all residents. The city’s actions demonstrate a moral stance against demonizing immigrants and a commitment to protecting families and fostering a welcoming environment. END OF SUMMARY.
