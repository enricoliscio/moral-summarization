SUMMARY:

Chicago's Mayor proudly announces that the city's arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have dramatically fallen in 2019 due to the city's refusal to cooperate with ICE. The Mayor attributes this to the city's "unequivocal support" of immigrant and refugee communities, rooted in the belief that diversity is a strength and a beacon of hope. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and requires police supervisors to verify ICE requests. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrant patrons. The Mayor emphasizes that this is not about hindering law enforcement but about protecting immigrant families and communities from demonization. The city's stance is a moral imperative, as children fear coming home to find their parents missing, and the nation should be crafting immigration policy based on welcoming and clear pathways to citizenship, not fear.
