SUMMARY:

The Mayor of Chicago announced that the city's arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have dramatically decreased in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate with ICE. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requires CPD supervisors to confirm ICE requests are truthful and not related to immigration enforcement. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on how to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. The Mayor emphasized that the city's stance is based on its belief in diversity and the importance of protecting immigrant and refugee communities. The city's actions have led to a significant expansion of immigrant protections, and the Mayor called for a national immigration policy that welcomes new residents with clear pathways to citizenship, rather than fear of arrests.

END OF SUMMARY.
