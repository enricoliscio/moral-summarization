Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points and identify the key morally charged terms.

The article talks about Chicago's efforts to protect immigrants, their cooperation with ICE, and the impact on the community. The author uses words like "support," "sacred," "protected," and "protections." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight Chicago's stance against ICE, the new ordinance, and the moral implications. I'll mention the decrease in ICE arrests, the ordinance's provisions, and the broader message about immigration policy and community safety.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally. Also, I should end with the specified tokens. Let me draft this, ensuring I incorporate the moral framing words effectively without making the summary too lengthy.

SUMMARY:  
The deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) highlighted a significant drop in Chicago-area arrests in 2019, attributing it to local officials' refusal to cooperate. Chicago's mayor emphasized the city's commitment to supporting immigrant and refugee communities, rooted in the belief that diversity and inclusion are sacred values. To bolster this commitment, the city passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and restricts ICE's ability to use CPD for immigration enforcement. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrants from ICE raids. While the city ensures public safety by targeting serious crimes, it firmly opposes using law enforcement for immigration enforcement. The measures, originally implemented as executive actions, are now codified into law, marking a significant expansion of immigrant protections. The author criticizes the federal government for politicizing ICE and demonizing immigrants, emphasizing that immigration policy should focus on welcoming newcomers rather than fostering fear. Chicago's actions reflect its values of unity, inclusion, and equity, ensuring the city remains a beacon of hope and a welcoming home for all. END OF SUMMARY.
