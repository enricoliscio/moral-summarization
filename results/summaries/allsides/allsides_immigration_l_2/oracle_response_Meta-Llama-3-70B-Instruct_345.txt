SUMMARY: Chicago's Mayor proudly announces that the city's immigrant and refugee communities are unequivocally supported, as the city's strength lies in its diversity. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance bolsters the Welcoming City Ordinance, prohibiting ICE from accessing police databases and requiring CPD supervisors to confirm ICE's truthfulness. The ordinance establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. This codification of measures ensures the city's law enforcement agencies can focus on serious crimes, while protecting immigrant families from fear of arrests. The Mayor credits city and state leaders, advocates, and community navigators for their vital services in educating and empowering undocumented immigrant families about their rights. The city's actions ensure community trust, necessary for effective local policing. The Mayor emphasizes that no one should be demonized for who they are, and that immigration policy should be based on welcoming newcomers, not fear. END OF SUMMARY.
