SUMMARY: Chicago's deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a significant drop in ICE arrests in the city in 2019 due to local officials' refusal to cooperate. The city's mayor reaffirmed Chicago's support for its immigrant and refugee communities, citing the belief that diversity strengthens the nation. To further protect these communities, the city passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which bolsters the existing Welcoming City Ordinance. The new ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and clarifies that CPD will not assist in immigration enforcement operations. It also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on protecting immigrants during ICE raids. These measures ensure community trust and effective local police work while maintaining the ability to investigate serious crimes. Chicago's stance reflects a complex national debate about immigrants rather than immigration policy. The city values its diverse immigrant population and recognizes their contributions to its success. Chicago aims to protect its communities and uphold its values of unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity.
