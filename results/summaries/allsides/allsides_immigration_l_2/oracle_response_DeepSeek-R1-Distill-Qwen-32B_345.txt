Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The deputy director of ICE mentioned that Chicago's arrests dropped because local officials didn't cooperate. The mayor is proud of supporting immigrants and refugees, emphasizing diversity and values like hope and inclusion.

They passed an ordinance to strengthen their Welcoming City policy, which prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and requires truthful requests for assistance. They also have reporting requirements and provide legal guidance to protect immigrants. The article mentions that this doesn't affect serious crime investigations, only immigration enforcement. They've codified previous executive actions into law, expanding protections.

The author criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE against immigrants, leading to fear and children being afraid. Chicago's efforts include educating and empowering immigrants, and they're proud but frustrated that they have to oppose federal agencies. The article concludes by highlighting Chicago's commitment to unity, inclusion, and protecting their communities.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like support, sacred, protected, bolster, prohibit, truthful, establish, provide, protect, safe, whole, codifying, protections, passed, educate, empower, demonized, welcoming, fear, afraid, inclusion, equity, division, ensure.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Chicago's proactive stance, the new ordinance, the reasons behind it, the criticism of federal policies, and the positive impact on the community. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and use the specified words where appropriate.

By supporting immigrants and refugees, Chicago upholds its values of diversity and hope, ensuring the city remains a beacon of protection and opportunity. END OF SUMMARY.
