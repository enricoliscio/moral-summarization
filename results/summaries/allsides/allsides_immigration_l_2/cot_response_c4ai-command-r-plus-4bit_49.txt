SUMMARY: Chicago's mayor is proud to support the city's immigrant and refugee communities. This pride stems from the belief that diversity is a source of strength and that protecting the values that have made the nation a beacon of hope is essential. To bolster this support, the city has passed an ordinance designed to strengthen its Welcoming City policy. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing local police databases and directs CPD to refuse assistance to ICE for immigration enforcement operations. It also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on protecting immigrant patrons during ICE raids. These measures ensure that law enforcement can still target serious or violent crimes and that appointed officers can assist in rare cases of criminal enterprise investigations, as long as city policies are followed. Chicago's stance is a direct response to the current administration's politicization of ICE and its campaign against immigrants and refugees. By protecting immigrant communities and building trust, the city upholds the principle that no one should be demonized for who they are. Chicago's immigrants have always contributed to the city's success and should be welcomed with clear paths to citizenship. The fear of children returning home to find their parents missing is a stark reminder of the need to protect communities and fight for unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity. Chicago remains committed to standing up for its neighbors and calling out division and demonization, endowed by the values that have ensured its success and status as the best city in the world to call home.
