Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants the summary to be concise, under 200 words, and to include the moral perspective the author presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Chicago's response to ICE's reduced arrests in 2019 because local officials didn't cooperate. Mayor Lightfoot is proud of their support for immigrants and refugees, citing diversity as a strength. They passed an ordinance to limit ICE's access to police databases and assistance, ensuring it doesn't interfere with serious crime investigations. This builds on previous policies and expands protections. The author criticizes the federal administration for politicizing ICE against immigrants, emphasizing that Chicago's actions are about protecting communities and maintaining trust with law enforcement. They also mention the human cost, like children fearing their parents' arrest.

I need to highlight the moral stance: protecting immigrants, opposing ICE's actions, and valuing diversity. The summary should reflect Chicago's proactive measures and the broader implications of the federal policies. I'll make sure to include the ordinance's specifics without getting too detailed, and end with the call for unity and inclusion.

I should structure the summary to start with the ICE issue, then Chicago's response, the moral reasoning, and the call to action. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll focus on the key points without extra details.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all essential moral points. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY:  
The deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently highlighted a significant decline in Chicago-area arrests in 2019, attributing it to local officials' refusal to cooperate. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot emphasized the city's commitment to protecting its immigrant and refugee communities, rooted in the belief that diversity strengthens the nation. To further this mission, the city passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, codifying previous executive actions. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases or seeking assistance for immigration enforcement, while ensuring compliance with city policies. It also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrants from ICE raids. The measure does not hinder investigations into serious crimes or special federal agreements on criminal enterprises. Lightfoot criticized the federal administration for politicizing ICE, turning it into a tool against immigrants. She highlighted Chicago's efforts to educate and empower undocumented families, emphasizing that immigration policy should focus on welcoming newcomers, not fear. The article condemns the demonization of immigrants and calls for unity, inclusion, and equity, reiterating Chicago's role as a Welcoming City. END OF SUMMARY.
