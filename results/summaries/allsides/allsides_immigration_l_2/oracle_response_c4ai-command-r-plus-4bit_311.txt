SUMMARY: Chicago's mayor expressed pride and support for the city's immigrant and refugee communities, highlighting the recent passage of the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance. This ordinance strengthens the city's Welcoming City Ordinance by prohibiting ICE from accessing CPD databases and prohibiting CPD from assisting ICE in immigration enforcement operations. The mayor emphasized the city's belief in diversity and the protection of sacred values. 

The measures ensure that ICE cannot use Chicago's law enforcement agencies to target undocumented immigrants for arrests. It also protects the city's ability to investigate serious crimes and work with federal authorities on rare occasions, provided city policies are followed. These measures were previously implemented through executive actions but are now codified into law, representing a significant expansion of immigrant protections. 

The mayor attributed the decrease in ICE arrests in Chicago to the city's refusal to cooperate with ICE, citing it as a positive outcome. The article also acknowledges the work of state leaders and local advocates in protecting immigrant communities. It criticizes the current administration's politicization of ICE and the demonization of immigrants, emphasizing the need for unity, inclusion, and equity. Chicago aims to protect its communities and uphold its status as a Welcoming City. 

END OF SUMMARY.
