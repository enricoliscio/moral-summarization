Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Chicago's response to ICE's reduced arrest numbers in 2019 because local officials didn't cooperate. The mayor is proud of their support for immigrants and refugees, and they passed an ordinance to strengthen their Welcoming City policy. 

Okay, the key points are: ICE arrests dropped because Chicago didn't cooperate. They passed a new ordinance that prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and restricts their enforcement through the police. They also increased reporting and legal guidance for public facilities. The ordinance doesn't affect serious crime investigations. The measures were previously executive actions but are now codified into law. The mayor credits this for ICE's lower numbers and criticizes the federal administration for politicizing immigration. Chicago's immigrants contribute to the city's success, and the focus should be on welcoming, not fear.

I should make sure the summary captures all these points concisely, within 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the ICE arrest decline, the reason, the new ordinance details, its implications, and the mayor's stance on immigration policy. I'll also highlight Chicago's immigrant contributions and the shift from executive actions to law.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot highlighted the city's support for immigrants and refugees, enacting the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance to strengthen the Welcoming City policy.

It doesn't hinder serious crime investigations. These measures, previously executive actions, are now codified into law, marking a significant expansion of immigrant protections. The mayor criticized the federal administration for politicizing immigration and emphasized Chicago's reliance on immigrants for its success. The focus should be on welcoming newcomers, not fear, with the city committed to unity, inclusion, and protecting its communities. END OF SUMMARY.
