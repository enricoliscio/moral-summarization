SUMMARY:

The Mayor of Chicago announced that the city's ICE arrests have dramatically fallen in 2019 due to local officials refusing to cooperate with ICE. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requires CPD supervisors to confirm ICE requests are truthful and not for immigration enforcement. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. The Mayor believes that the city's strength lies in its diversity and that the values of welcoming and protecting immigrants are sacred and need to be protected. The city's actions are a response to the current administration's politicization of ICE and its demonization of immigrants and refugees.

END OF SUMMARY.
