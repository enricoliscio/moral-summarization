SUMMARY:

The Mayor of Chicago announced that the city's ICE arrests have dramatically fallen in 2019 due to local officials refusing to cooperate with ICE. The city has passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and requires CPD supervisors to confirm ICE requests are truthful and not related to immigration enforcement. The ordinance also establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to public facilities on how to protect immigrant patrons. The Mayor believes that the city's diversity is its strength and that immigrants should be welcomed with clear pathways to citizenship, not feared and arrested. The city will continue to protect its communities and fight for unity, inclusion, and opportunity.

END OF SUMMARY.
