SUMMARY:

The City of Chicago has taken a strong stance in support of its immigrant and refugee communities, proudly announcing a significant decline in ICE arrests in 2019. This is due to the city's unequivocal support of its diverse communities, which is sacred and needs to be protected. The Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance has been passed to bolster the Welcoming City Ordinance, prohibiting ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and ensuring that ICE cannot turn to CPD for assistance with immigration enforcement operations. The ordinance establishes reporting requirements and provides legal guidance to protect immigrant patrons from ICE raids. This move is a significant expansion of immigrant protections in Chicago, making it a beacon of hope for its newest residents. The city's actions ensure that its communities remain safe and whole, and that no one is demonized for who they are. By standing up for its neighbors and calling out division and demonization, Chicago remains committed to its values of unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity.
