SUMMARY: Chicago's mayor stands up for the city's immigrant and refugee communities, citing the belief that diversity is a source of strength and that welcoming immigrants is a moral imperative. The city has taken steps to protect these communities by refusing to cooperate with ICE arrests, which the mayor believes are cynical and politicized. Chicago's actions are grounded in the principle that no one should be demonized for who they are, and that immigrants contribute to the city's success by driving its economy and fostering talent. The mayor acknowledges the complexities of immigration policy but asserts that the national debate has focused on demonizing immigrants rather than on policy discussions. Chicago is committed to protecting its communities, upholding its status as a Welcoming City, and fighting for unity, inclusion, equity, and opportunity for all its residents, standing up for its neighbors, and calling out division and demonization. These values, the mayor believes, are integral to the city's heritage, success, and reputation as one of the best cities in the world. END OF SUMMARY.
