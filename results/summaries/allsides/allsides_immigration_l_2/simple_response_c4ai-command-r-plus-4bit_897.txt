SUMMARY: Chicago's deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decried a drop in ICE arrests in the area, citing a lack of cooperation from local officials. Chicago's mayor responded with pride, attributing the decline to the city's unwavering support for immigrant and refugee communities. The city's Welcoming City Ordinance, which traces back to 1985, has been strengthened with additional measures to protect these communities. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing police databases and mandates confirmation of ICE's truthful requests for assistance. Legal guidance will be provided to public facilities to protect immigrant patrons during ICE raids. These protections ensure community trust and effective local policing. While immigration policy is complex, the principle of not demonizing individuals for who they are remains simple. Chicago's immigrants contribute to the city's success, and the nation's immigration policy should focus on welcoming new residents, not fear-mongering. Chicago is committed to protecting its communities, upholding its values of unity and inclusion, and fighting for equity and opportunity for all.

END OF SUMMARY.
