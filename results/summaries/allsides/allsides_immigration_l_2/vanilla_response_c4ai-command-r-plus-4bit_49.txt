SUMMARY: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot penned an op-ed defending the city's lack of cooperation with ICE, which led to a decrease in ICE arrests in the area in 2019. Lightfoot cites the city's commitment to protecting immigrant and refugee communities, highlighting the recently passed Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance. The ordinance prohibits ICE from accessing Chicago Police Department databases and mandates that ICE cannot enlist CPD's help for immigration enforcement operations. Lightfoot emphasizes that the city's stance does not hinder law enforcement's ability to pursue serious or violent criminals and that Chicago's immigrant communities are integral to the city's success. She criticizes the current administration's politicization of ICE and reaffirms Chicago's dedication to unity, inclusion, and protection of its residents.

END OF SUMMARY.
