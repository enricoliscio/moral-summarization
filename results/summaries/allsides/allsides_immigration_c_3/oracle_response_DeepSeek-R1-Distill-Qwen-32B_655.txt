Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency aid package for migrants, facing resistance from some Democrats but ultimately passing. The bill includes funds for shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance, aiming to prevent a humanitarian crisis. Pelosi emphasized the importance of caring for children and families. The Senate has a different bill, and there's a potential veto from Trump. The conditions at the border are dire, with overcrowding and poor treatment leading to deaths.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by mentioning the passage of the bill, noting the last-minute efforts by Democrats. I'll highlight the key provisions, using words like "emergency," "prevent," "ensure," "protecting," "shelter," "feed," and "care." I'll include Pelosi's statements to emphasize the moral imperative. Then, I'll mention the Senate's stance and Trump's potential veto, using "veto" and "failure." I'll also touch on the dire conditions and the deaths, using "housed," "kept," "incident," "died," and "overwhelmed." Finally, I'll note the political pressures and the need for bipartisan action.

I need to ensure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words and includes as many of the provided moral words as possible. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the bill's passage, its provisions, the political dynamics, and the humanitarian crisis it aims to address.

SUMMARY: The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to address the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, following last-minute changes and efforts by Democratic leaders to quell a mini-revolt among progressives and Hispanic lawmakers. The bill, which passed 230-195 along party lines, aims to prevent a humanitarian emergency by ensuring care for migrant families and unaccompanied children, providing shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the need to protect families and ensure funds are used for humanitarian purposes, not for Trump's border wall or immigration raids. The bill mandates improved standards for children in government shelters and blocks the use of funds for detention beds or the wall. However, the Senate may push for a bipartisan companion bill, and Trump has threatened a veto, arguing the House bill hampers border security. The urgent need to act stems from reports of dire conditions, including overcrowded Border Patrol stations and the deaths of children in custody. The bill's passage reflects a moral imperative to address the plight of migrants, but political divisions and a looming July 4 recess heighten the pressure to resolve the issue before agencies run out of funds. END OF SUMMARY.
