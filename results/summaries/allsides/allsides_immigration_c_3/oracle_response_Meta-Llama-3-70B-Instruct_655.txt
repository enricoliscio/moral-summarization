SUMMARY:

The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill aims to prevent a humanitarian emergency from turning into a debacle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ensured that the bill provides access to legal assistance, protects families, and ensures children have food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care. The bill also mandates improved standards of care at HHS "influx shelters" and blocks information on sponsors of immigrant children from being used to deport them. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would hamstring the administration's border security efforts. The Senate may try to force Democrats to send President Donald Trump a different, bipartisan measure. The urgent need for funding has outweighed concerns, as agencies are about to run out of money and failure to act could bring a swift political rebuke and accusations of ignoring the plight of innocent immigrant children.

END OF SUMMARY.
