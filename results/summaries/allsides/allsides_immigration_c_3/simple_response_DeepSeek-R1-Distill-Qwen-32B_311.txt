Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article talks about the House passing a $4.5 billion emergency aid package for migrants. There were some internal conflicts within the Democratic party, with Pelosi convincing progressives to support the bill. The bill focuses on providing shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance to migrants, especially children. It also includes measures to prevent funds from being used for the border wall or immigration enforcement. The Senate has a different bill, and there's tension between the two chambers. The White House threatens a veto, and there are concerns about the conditions of detained children, which adds urgency.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, like the humanitarian crisis, the protection of families, and the opposition to the border wall. I should mention the key points: the bill's funding, Pelosi's arguments, the Senate's stance, the White House's veto threat, and the dire conditions leading to the urgency.

I should structure the summary to first state the bill's passage, then the provisions, the opposition, the moral arguments, and the urgency. Keeping it concise under 200 words is crucial. I'll make sure to include Pelosi's quote about family unity and the mention of children's conditions to emphasize the moral framing.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and includes all necessary elements without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $4.5 billion emergency aid package for migrant families and children, despite internal Democratic disagreements and Republican opposition. The bill, which passed 230-195 along party lines, allocates funds for shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance, while ensuring money cannot be used for the border wall or immigration enforcement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the need to protect families and provide humanitarian aid, though progressive Democrats and Republicans criticized the bill as partisan. The Senate plans to advance its own bipartisan measure, and the White House threatens a veto, arguing the bill hampers border security. Urgency stems from reports of dire conditions for detained migrants, including overcrowded facilities and inadequate care, highlighting the moral imperative to address the crisis before a July 4 recess.
