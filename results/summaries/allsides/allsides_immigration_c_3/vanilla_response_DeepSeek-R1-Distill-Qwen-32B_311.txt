Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the House passing a $4.5 billion emergency aid package for the border. They had some internal issues with progressives and Hispanic lawmakers wanting changes, but Pelosi managed to get it passed. The bill focuses on shelter, food, and medical care for migrants and kids. It also blocks funds for the border wall. The Senate might have a different bill, and there's a threat of veto from Trump. Some House Republicans and Democrats opposed it. The urgency is high because agencies are running out of money, and conditions for migrants are dire. Some kids died in custody, and a Border Patrol chief is resigning. The article ends with the White House's objections to the bill.

So, the summary should include the key points: the bill's passage, its funding, opposition from some lawmakers, Senate's possible move, Trump's threat, the urgent need due to poor conditions, and the White House's objections. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, despite internal dissent among Democrats, to address the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill, which passed 230-195, allocates funds for shelter, food, and medical care for migrants and unaccompanied children, while blocking funds for Trump's border wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the bill's focus on humanitarian needs, though it faced criticism from progressives and Hispanic lawmakers who sought more significant changes. The Senate is expected to propose a bipartisan alternative, and the White House has threatened a veto, arguing the bill hampers border security. The urgency stems from reports of dire conditions for detainees, including overcrowded facilities and inadequate care, with federal agencies nearing budget depletion. END OF SUMMARY.
