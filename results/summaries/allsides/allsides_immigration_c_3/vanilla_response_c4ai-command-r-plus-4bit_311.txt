SUMMARY: The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to address the humanitarian crisis at the US-Mexico border, with a vote of 230-195 along party lines. The bill provides funding to shelter, feed, and care for migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the border. It also seeks to improve standards of care and protect families by blocking information from being used for deportation. The bill denies additional funding for ICE detention beds and Trump's border wall. Speaker Nancy Pelosi quelled a revolt by progressives and Hispanic lawmakers, adding more modest changes to the bill. The Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, may try to force the House to accept a different bipartisan companion measure. The White House has threatened a veto, citing a lack of funding for border security and ICE detention beds. The bill's passage comes amid reports of dire conditions and deaths of children in US custody, with federal agencies overwhelmed by the surge of migrants. Changes to the bill include requiring DHS to establish standards of care for unaccompanied children and ensuring adequate translators. The urgent need to address the humanitarian crisis outweighed concerns, with pressure to act before Congress' recess.
END OF SUMMARY.
