SUMMARY: Last-minute changes and lobbying by Democratic leaders helped pass a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill passed along party lines, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi quelling a mini-revolt by progressive and Hispanic lawmakers concerned about the treatment of migrants. The bill includes funding to shelter, feed, and provide legal assistance to migrants, with protections to ensure the funding is used for humanitarian needs and cannot be redirected towards border security efforts such as Trump's border wall. It also seeks to mandate improved standards of care for unaccompanied children. The bill passed with mostly Democratic support, setting up a showdown with the Republican-led Senate. The urgency to provide humanitarian aid was amplified by recent reports of dire conditions and deaths at detention facilities, with federal agencies overwhelmed and depleting their budgets. The changes made to the bill include requiring improved standards of care and access to translators for unaccompanied children. Despite the White House's threat to veto the bill, Democrats pushed it through, emphasizing the need to solve the humanitarian crisis and protect vulnerable migrants from the Trump administration's harsh immigration policies. 

END OF SUMMARY.
