SUMMARY:
The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to address the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill aims to provide care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained in "gruesome" conditions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized that the bill ensures children have access to food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care, and protects families because "families belong together." The legislation seeks to mandate improved standards of care and block information on sponsors of immigrant children from being used to deport them. The bill also denies additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds and the border wall. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, citing concerns that it would "hamstring" border security efforts. The Senate is expected to propose a different bill, setting up a showdown between the two chambers. END OF SUMMARY.
