Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using as many of those words as possible.

Starting with step one, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. These are words that imply right, wrong, good, or bad. For example, words like "cruel," "urgent," "deplorable," "safeguards," "plight," etc. I should list each of these words, each on a new line with a *.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The summary should capture the essence of the article, highlighting the key points about the emergency funding, the political struggle, the conditions faced by migrants, and the opposing viewpoints.

I'll start by reading through the article again to make sure I don't miss any morally charged words. Words like "humanitarian," "emergency," "plight," "safeguards," "cruel," "deplorable," "urgency," "provisions," "needs," "rebellion," "veto," "border wall," "detention," "sanitation," "overwhelmed," "deaths," "standards," "translators," "contractors," "care," "funding," "security," "score," "law," "signature," "solve," "recess," "repute," "accusations," "innocent," "plight," "gruesome," "windowless," "inadequate," "sanitation," "overcrowded," "capacity," "outrage," "treatment," "veto," "funding," "detain," "border wall," "complaints," "border security," "build," "proposed," "border wall," "deaths," "care," "capacity," "outrage," "treatment," "veto," "funding," "detain," "border wall," "complaints," "border security," "build," "proposed," "border wall."

Now, for the summary, I'll structure it to include the key points: the House passing the bill, the opposition from some Democrats and Republicans, the funding specifics, the conditions faced by migrants, the political implications, and the urgency to pass the legislation before the recess.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes the morally framed words naturally. I'll start with the passage of the bill, mention the opposition, the funding details, the conditions, the political battle, and the consequences of inaction.

I should also keep an eye on the word count to stay under 200 words. I'll draft the summary, then check the word count and adjust as necessary, making sure to retain the moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**

The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, despite opposition from some Democrats and Republicans. The bill aims to address the urgent humanitarian needs of migrant families and children, providing funding for shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance. Critics, including President Trump, argue it lacks funds for border security and a wall. Conditions for detainees, including overcrowding and inadequate care, have sparked outrage. The bill includes safeguards to prevent funds from being used for detention or the border wall. Senate Republicans propose a bipartisan alternative, while Democrats emphasize their bill's focus on humanitarian aid. The political battle continues as Congress races to act before a recess, with agencies facing budget shortages and potential political backlash for inaction. The plight of detained children and deplorable conditions highlight the urgency for legislative action. END OF SUMMARY.
