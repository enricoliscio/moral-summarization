SUMMARY:

The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill aims to prevent a humanitarian emergency from turning into a debacle. It ensures that children have food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care, and provides access to legal assistance. The bill also seeks to mandate improved standards of care and block information on sponsors of immigrant children from being used to deport them. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would hamstring the administration's border security efforts. The Senate's top Republican suggested the House should accept the Senate measure, which received only a single "nay" vote during a committee vote last week. The bill's passage comes amid reports of gruesome conditions in Border Patrol stations, where children have died in U.S. custody. The sense of urgency to provide humanitarian aid is amplified by the dire conditions reported at numerous locations where detainees have been held.

END OF SUMMARY.
