Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the House passing a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package. 

First, I need to understand the task. They mentioned two steps: identifying morally framed words and then summarizing the article, keeping as many of those words as possible. 

Looking at the article, I should go through it and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "emergency," "humanitarian," "cruel," "safeguards," "tear apart," "terrorize," "dire," "gruesome," "overwhelmed," "depleted," "harsh," "died," "outrage," "lacked," "needs," "ignored," "innocent," "pushing," "partisan," "score," "rebuke," "ignored," "innocent," "gruesome," "dire," "outrage," "ignored," "innocent," "gruesome," "dire," "outrage," "ignored," "innocent." These words convey the moral stance of the article.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The key points are the passage of the bill, the opposition from some Democrats and Republicans, the funding allocation, the opposition from the White House and Senate, the conditions at the border, and the consequences of inaction. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the urgent need for aid, the opposition to Trump's policies, and the dire conditions faced by migrants.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. I'll start by mentioning the passage of the bill, then touch on the opposition, funding details, the Senate's stance, the conditions reported, and the consequences. I'll make sure to include words like "humanitarian," "cruel," "dire," "gruesome," etc., to maintain the moral perspective.

I should also check that the summary accurately reflects the article's content without adding personal opinions. It's important to balance the summary to show both the Democratic support and Republican opposition, as well as the White House's veto threat. 

Finally, I'll make sure the summary ends with the necessary token and stays within the word limit. I'll review the summary to ensure it's clear, concise, and retains the moral framing as required.

**SUMMARY:**  
The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, despite opposition from some Democrats and Republicans. The bill aims to address the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, providing funding for migrant families and unaccompanied children, including food, shelter, medical care, and legal assistance. It also mandates improved care standards and prohibits funds from being used for Trump's border wall or immigration enforcement. However, the bill faced criticism from Republicans and the White House, which threatened a veto, arguing it hampers border security. The Senate proposed a bipartisan alternative, but House Democrats defended their bill as better for protecting families and ensuring humanitarian needs. The urgency stemmed from reports of dire conditions, including overcrowded facilities and inadequate care for children. The bill passed 230-195, setting up a potential clash with the Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
