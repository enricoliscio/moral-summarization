Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll start by reading the article carefully to understand the context and the key points. The article discusses the House passing a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, the political dynamics between Democrats and Republicans, and the humanitarian issues at the border.

Next, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "cruel," "tear apart," "terrorize," "safeguards," "humanitarian," "ignore," "dire," "gruesome," "overwhelmed," "depleting," "harsh," "outrage," and "veto" come to mind. These words highlight the ethical issues and the urgency of the situation.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll start by mentioning the passage of the bill, the opposition from progressives and Republicans, the funding details, and the opposition from Trump and McConnell. I'll also include the humanitarian crisis, the conditions in detention centers, and the consequences of inaction. It's important to highlight Pelosi's and Lowey's statements to emphasize the moral stance against the administration's policies.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the legislative process, the funding specifics, the political opposition, the humanitarian conditions, and the urgency to pass the bill before the recess. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the original framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's concise, captures all key points, and stays within the word limit. I'll check that the morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to address the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, despite opposition from progressives and Republicans. The bill, which funds care for migrant families and unaccompanied children, faced criticism from President Trump and Senate Republicans, who sought a different approach. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the bill's focus on providing food, shelter, and medical care for children, while Democrats criticized Trump's "cruel" immigration policies. The bill also blocks funding for the border wall and detention beds, ensuring resources are used for humanitarian needs. However, three Republican moderates supported the measure, while four Democratic freshmen opposed it. The Senate is expected to push its own bipartisan bill, with McConnell urging the House to accept it to secure Trump's signature. The urgency to act stems from reports of dire conditions in detention facilities, including overcrowding and inadequate care, which have led to child deaths. The bill aims to improve standards for unaccompanied children and replace contractors providing inadequate care. The White House threatened to veto the House bill, citing a lack of funding for border security and detention beds. END OF SUMMARY.
