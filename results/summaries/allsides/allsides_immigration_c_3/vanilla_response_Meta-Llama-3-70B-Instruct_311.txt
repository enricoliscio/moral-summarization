SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for migrant families and unaccompanied children detained at the US-Mexico border. The bill passed along party lines with 230-195 votes, despite last-minute changes and opposition from progressive and Hispanic lawmakers. The package includes funding for shelter, food, and medical care for migrants, as well as improved standards of care at Health and Human Services "influx shelters". The bill also blocks funding for President Trump's border wall and immigration raids. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, citing concerns that it would hinder border security efforts. The Senate is expected to consider a different, bipartisan bill, setting up a showdown between the two chambers. The urgent need for funding has been highlighted by reports of dire conditions at border detention facilities, including a recent incident in Texas where over 300 infants and children were being held in inadequate conditions.
