SUMMARY:

The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill aims to prevent a humanitarian emergency from turning into a debacle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quelled a mini-revolt by progressives and Hispanic lawmakers, ensuring that children have food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care. The bill provides access to legal assistance, protects families, and mandates improved standards of care. It blocks information on sponsors of immigrant children from being used to deport them and denies additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds. The bill's passage sets up a showdown with the Republican-led Senate, which may try to force Democrats to send President Donald Trump a different, and broadly bipartisan, companion measure. Failure to act could bring a swift political rebuke and accusations of ignoring the plight of innocent immigrant children.

END OF SUMMARY.
