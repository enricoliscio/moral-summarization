Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the House passing a $4.5 billion border aid package. Let me read through it carefully.

The House passed the bill with some resistance from progressives and Hispanic lawmakers. Pelosi managed to get it through by adding some provisions. The bill focuses on humanitarian aid for migrants and children, ensuring they get food, shelter, medical care, and legal assistance. It also blocks funds from being used for the border wall or ICE detention.

The Senate has a different bill, and there's a potential showdown. The White House threatens a veto, saying the bill hinders border security. Some Republicans tried to convince Trump to reject the Senate bill, but he's expected to refuse. The urgency is high because agencies are running out of money, and conditions for detainees are dire, with reports of poor facilities and even deaths.

So, the moral framing here is about humanitarian needs versus border security. The Democrats are emphasizing helping migrants and children, while Republicans and Trump are focusing on security and enforcement. The summary should highlight this tension, the provisions of the bill, and the political standoff.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points: the bill's passage, its provisions, the political conflict, the humanitarian aspect, and the consequences of not acting.
