SUMMARY:
The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill, which passed along party lines, aims to provide "humanitarian" aid to prevent a "debacle" on the border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized that the bill ensures children have access to food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care, and protects families because "families belong together." The bill also seeks to mandate improved standards of care at HHS "influx shelters" and block information on sponsors of immigrant children from being used to deport them. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would "hamstring" the administration's border security efforts. The bill's passage sets up a showdown with the Republican-led Senate, which may try to force Democrats to send President Donald Trump a different, and broadly bipartisan, companion measure.
