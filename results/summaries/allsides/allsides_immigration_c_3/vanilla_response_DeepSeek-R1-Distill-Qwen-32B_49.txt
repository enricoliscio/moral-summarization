Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the U.S. House passing a $4.5 billion emergency aid package for the border. It mentions that Democrats had to make some last-minute changes to get it passed. The bill includes funds for migrant families and unaccompanied children, with provisions to prevent money from being used for the border wall or immigration enforcement. The Senate is expected to oppose this and push their own bill. The situation is urgent because of the humanitarian crisis at the border, with reports of bad conditions in detention centers. The House bill passed 230-195, with some Democrats and a few Republicans opposing. The White House threatens a veto, and there's a deadline before the July 4 recess. The key points are the funding, the opposition, the urgency, and the consequences if not passed. I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the main elements: the bill's passage, funding details, opposition, Senate's stance, White House's threat, and the urgency due to the humanitarian crisis. I'll structure it to cover the House's action, the bill's content, the political battle, and the implications.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, following last-minute changes and pressure from Democratic leaders. The bill, which passed 230-195, provides funding for migrant families and unaccompanied children detained at the U.S.-Mexico border, with provisions to ensure funds are used for humanitarian needs only, not for the border wall or immigration enforcement. The Senate, led by Republicans, may push its own bipartisan measure, setting up a potential clash. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the bill's focus on basic needs like food, shelter, and medical care for children and families. The legislation also mandates improved care standards at shelters and prohibits using sponsor information for deportations. The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, arguing it hampers border security efforts. With Congress set to recess July 4, there is urgent pressure to resolve the funding before agencies run out of money. Reports of dire conditions at detention facilities, including a windowless Border Patrol station in Texas, have heightened the sense of urgency. The bill's passage reflects a partisan divide, with some Democrats and Republicans opposing the measure, while the Senate aims to finalize its version to secure the president's signature.
