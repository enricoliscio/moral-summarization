SUMMARY:

The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill aims to prevent a humanitarian emergency on the border from turning into a debacle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ensured that children have food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care, and that families are protected because "families belong together." The bill mandates improved standards of care at HHS "influx shelters" and blocks information on sponsors of immigrant children from being used to deport them. It also denies additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds and Mr. Trump's border wall. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would hamstring the administration's border security efforts. The Senate may try to force Democrats to send President Donald Trump a different, and broadly bipartisan, companion measure. The urgent need for the funding is clear, as agencies are about to run out of money and failure to act could bring a swift political rebuke and accusations of ignoring the plight of innocent immigrant children.

END OF SUMMARY.
