SUMMARY: The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to address the humanitarian crisis at the US-Mexico border, with a vote of 230-195 along party lines. The bill aims to provide funding for the care of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained at the border, including shelter, food, and legal assistance. Speaker Nancy Pelosi quelled a revolt by progressive and Hispanic lawmakers, and the bill now includes additional provisions mandating improved standards of care and protection for families. The bill also blocks funding for Trump's border wall and denies additional funding for ICE detention beds. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, while the Senate's Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggested the House accept the Senate's bipartisan companion measure. Changes to the bill include requiring the DHS to establish new standards of care for unaccompanied children and ensure adequate translators. The urgent need for humanitarian aid has been highlighted by recent reports of dire conditions and deaths of children in US custody. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.

END OF SUMMARY.
