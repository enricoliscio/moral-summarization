Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the U.S. House passing a $4.5 billion emergency aid package for the border. It mentions that it took some effort from Democratic leaders to get it passed. The bill was approved 230-195, mostly along party lines. Pelosi had to handle some resistance from progressives and Hispanic lawmakers, but they added some provisions, though not as much as those lawmakers wanted.

The funding is for shelter, food, and medical care for migrants and unaccompanied children. It also includes legal assistance and better care standards. The bill prevents funds from being used for the border wall or ICE detention. Some Democrats opposed it, including freshmen like Ocasio-Cortez. The Senate is expected to have a different bill, and the White House might veto the House's version. The urgency comes from reports of poor conditions at border facilities, like the one in Texas where children were held in bad conditions. The article also mentions the high number of migrants being detained and the agencies being overwhelmed.

So, I need to condense all this into a summary of under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the bill's passage, its funding details, opposition, Senate's stance, White House's threat, and the urgent conditions prompting the aid. I'll make sure to include Pelosi's comments and the implications for both chambers.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, aimed at addressing the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, with funding for migrant families and unaccompanied children. The bill, approved 230-195 along party lines, faced opposition from progressives and Hispanic lawmakers but included modest changes to address urgent needs. It provides funding for shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance, while preventing funds from being used for the border wall or ICE detention beds. Three Republican moderates supported the bill, while some Democratic freshmen opposed it. The Senate is expected to propose a bipartisan alternative, and the White House has threatened a veto, citing concerns over border security funding. The urgency stems from reports of dire conditions in border facilities, including overcrowding and poor treatment of children. The bill also mandates improved care standards for unaccompanied minors and aims to ensure funds are used solely for humanitarian purposes. END OF SUMMARY.
