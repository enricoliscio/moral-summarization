SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives has passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for migrant families and unaccompanied children detained at the US-Mexico border. The bill, which passed along party lines, aims to provide humanitarian aid, including food, clothing, and medical care, to those in detention centers. The bill also seeks to improve standards of care and block funding for President Trump's border wall and immigration raids. Despite last-minute changes, some progressive and Hispanic lawmakers were unhappy with the final bill. The Senate is expected to try to pass a different, bipartisan bill, setting up a showdown between the two chambers. The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, saying it would hamstring border security efforts. The urgency to pass the legislation is high, as agencies are running out of money and failure to act could lead to a humanitarian crisis.

END OF SUMMARY.
