Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The House passed a $4.5 billion aid package for migrants, facing resistance from some Democrats but getting through with last-minute changes. Pelosi had to quell a mini-revolt. The bill aims to prevent a humanitarian emergency, ensuring care, shelter, and legal assistance. It blocks funding for the border wall and ICE detention beds. The Senate might oppose it, and Trump threatened a veto. Conditions at detention centers are dire, with overcrowding and poor care leading to child deaths. The urgency is high as funding is about to run out.

Now, I'll identify the key morally framed words from the list: quelled, mini-revolt, prevent, emergency, ensure, care, provide, assistance, protect, shelter, feed, mandate, standards, block, policies, tear, terrorize, raids, veto, failure, ignoring, score, avoiding, solve, aid, housed, kept, incident, held, died, overwhelmed, depleting, establish, assist, treatment.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, focusing on the actions and the moral implications. I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll mention Pelosi quelling the mini-revolt, the purpose of the bill to prevent an emergency, the funding for care and shelter, blocking wall funding, Trump's veto threat, the dire conditions leading to child deaths, and the urgency to pass the bill before funding runs out.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the passage of the bill, the challenges faced, the provisions, opposition, and the consequences of inaction. I'll include the morally charged words where appropriate without forcing them in.

Let me draft this concisely, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, quelling a mini-revolt by progressives and Hispanic lawmakers, to prevent a humanitarian emergency for detained migrant families and children. The bill, which passed 230-195, aims to ensure care, shelter, and legal assistance while blocking funding for Trump's border wall and ICE detention beds. Pelosi emphasized the need to protect families and provide humanitarian aid, but the Senate may oppose it, with Trump threatening a veto. The bill mandates improved standards for unaccompanied children, but GOP conservatives pushed for additional immigration enforcement funding. Urgency grew amid reports of dire conditions, including overcrowded detention centers and child deaths. The legislation faces political pressure as Congress races to act before a recess, with agencies warning of budget depletion and the risk of ignoring the plight of migrant children. END OF SUMMARY.
