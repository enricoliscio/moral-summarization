Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about the U.S. House passing a $4.5 billion emergency aid package for the border. It mentions that it was a last-minute effort by Democratic leaders, and the bill passed 230-195, mostly along party lines. Pelosi had to calm some progressives and Hispanic lawmakers who wanted more changes, but the added provisions were more modest. The funding is for migrant families and unaccompanied children, focusing on shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance. It also blocks funds from being used for the border wall or immigration enforcement.

The Senate has a different bill that's bipartisan, and there's a potential showdown. The White House threatens to veto the House bill, saying it hinders border security. The article also mentions the poor conditions at detention facilities, like the Clint, Texas station, where children were held in bad conditions. The Border Patrol is overwhelmed with over 130,000 apprehensions last month. The House bill includes new standards for child care and translator services, and the DHS is replacing contractors who didn't provide adequate care. Some GOP lawmakers tried to convince Trump to reject the Senate bill and ask for more funding, but he's expected to refuse. The urgency is high as Congress is about to recess, and agencies are running out of money.

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the bill's passage, funding details, opposition, Senate's stance, White House's veto threat, the humanitarian issues, and the political implications. I should make sure to include Pelosi's comments and the conditions faced by migrants. Also, note the political divide and the urgency to pass the bill before recess. Let me structure this concisely, ensuring all main elements are covered without getting too detailed.

The bill, passed 230-195 along party lines, includes funding for shelter, food, medical care, and legal assistance, while blocking funds for the border wall or immigration enforcement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the urgent need to prevent a humanitarian crisis, though some progressives and Hispanic lawmakers sought more significant changes. The Senate is expected to push its own bipartisan measure, setting up a potential showdown. The White House threatened to veto the House bill, citing its lack of border security funding. Conditions at detention facilities, including overcrowding and poor sanitation, have drawn criticism, with reports of children being held in harsh conditions. The bill also mandates improved care standards for unaccompanied children and translator services. Congressional pressure to act before the July 4 recess remains intense. END OF SUMMARY.
