SUMMARY: Last-minute changes and lobbying by Democratic leaders helped pass a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package in the House to address the humanitarian emergency on the US-Mexico border. The bill, which passed along party lines, aims to provide care and resources for migrant families and unaccompanied children detained after crossing the border. Despite threats of a mini-revolt by progressive and Hispanic lawmakers, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was able to quell the dissent and ensure the bill's passage. The bill includes funding to shelter, feed, and provide legal assistance to migrants, with stringent safeguards to ensure funds are used for humanitarian needs. It also blocks information on sponsors of immigrant children from being used for deportation and denies additional funding for ICE detention beds. The bill now faces a challenge in the Republican-led Senate, which may push for a different version. The sense of urgency is heightened by recent reports of dire conditions and deaths of children in US custody. The bill aims to address these issues and establish improved standards of care for unaccompanied children. The White House has threatened a veto, citing a lack of funding for border security and ICE detention beds. Lawmakers are under pressure to act before Congress recesses for July 4, as federal agencies are running out of funds and the situation on the border continues to deteriorate.
END OF SUMMARY.
