SUMMARY:
The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to address the humanitarian emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill aims to provide care for thousands of migrant families and unaccompanied children detained in "gruesome" and "harsh" conditions. The legislation ensures that children have access to food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care, and protects families from being torn apart. The bill also blocks funding for President Trump's border wall and denies additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds. Despite the White House threatening to veto the bill, Democrats argue that it is necessary to prevent a "debacle" and address the "dire" conditions faced by migrant children. The bill now heads to the Republican-led Senate, where it may face opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
