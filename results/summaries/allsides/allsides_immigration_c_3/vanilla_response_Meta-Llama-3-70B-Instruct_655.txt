SUMMARY:

The US House of Representatives has passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for migrant families and unaccompanied children detained at the US-Mexico border. The bill passed along party lines with 230-195 votes, despite last-minute changes and opposition from progressive and Hispanic lawmakers. The bill aims to provide humanitarian aid, including food, shelter, and medical care, and mandates improved standards of care at shelters housing migrant children. It also blocks funding for President Trump's border wall and immigration raids. The bill now faces a showdown with the Republican-led Senate, which may try to force Democrats to accept a different, bipartisan measure. The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, citing concerns it would hinder border security efforts.

END OF SUMMARY.
