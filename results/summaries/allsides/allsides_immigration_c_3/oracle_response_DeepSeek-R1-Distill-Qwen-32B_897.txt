Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the House passing a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package. It mentions that there were some internal conflicts within the Democratic party, with Pelosi having to quell a mini-revolt from progressives and Hispanic lawmakers. They added some provisions but not as much as those lawmakers wanted. The bill passed, and now it's going to face challenges in the Republican-led Senate.

The bill's purpose is to provide aid for migrant families and unaccompanied children, ensuring they have food, shelter, medical care, and legal assistance. It also aims to prevent funding from being used for the border wall or immigration enforcement. There's a lot of moral language here, like "quelled," "prevent," "emergency," "care," "protecting," etc.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these morally charged words as possible. The key points are the passage of the bill, the internal party struggles, the funding for humanitarian needs, the opposition from Republicans, the threat of veto, and the dire conditions faced by migrants.

I should structure the summary to highlight the urgency and the moral stance taken by Democrats, while also noting the Republican opposition. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, so I have to be concise but include the essential elements with the moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include words like "quelled," "mini-revolt," "emergency," "ensure," "protecting," "shelter," "feed," "block," "policies," "tear," "terrorize," "veto," "failure," "ignoring," "solve," "aid," "housed," "died," "overwhelmed," etc.

I'll start by stating that the House passed the bill with Pelosi quelling a mini-revolt. Then mention the funding for humanitarian aid, the provisions to prevent funds from being used for the wall, and the Republican opposition. Include the threat of veto and the dire conditions leading to the bill's urgency.

I need to make sure it flows well and covers all the main points without going over the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi quelling a mini-revolt among progressives and Hispanic lawmakers. The bill aims to prevent a humanitarian crisis by ensuring care, shelter, and legal assistance for migrant families and children, while blocking funds for the border wall. Republicans oppose the measure, with the Senate proposing a different bill, and the White House threatening a veto. The urgency stems from dire conditions reported at detention facilities, where children faced harsh treatment, including inadequate food and sanitation. Federal agencies are overwhelmed, and the bill mandates improved standards for child care. Despite internal party tensions, Democrats emphasized the need to protect families and avoid political partisanship. The legislation faces a tough path in the Senate as Congress races to act before a July 4 recess. END OF SUMMARY.
