SUMMARY:

The House of Representatives passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package to care for migrant families and unaccompanied children detained at the US-Mexico border. The bill, which passed along party lines, aims to provide humanitarian aid and prevent a debacle on the border. The package includes funding for shelter, food, and medical care for migrants, as well as improved standards of care for unaccompanied children. The bill also blocks funding for President Trump's border wall and immigration raids. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would hamstring border security efforts. The Senate is expected to pass a different, bipartisan companion measure, setting up a showdown between the two chambers. The urgent need for funding has intensified as agencies are about to run out of money, and failure to act could bring political rebuke.

END OF SUMMARY.
