Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the House passing a $4.5 billion border aid package. The author highlights the urgency due to the humanitarian crisis, the Democrats' efforts to pass the bill despite internal dissent, and the contrast with Republican priorities.

First, I'll identify the key points: the bill's funding for migrant care, the political struggle within the Democratic party, Pelosi's arguments, the Senate's stance, and the conditions faced by migrants. I should mention the opposition from some Democrats and the White House's veto threat, emphasizing the moral issues like family separation and poor conditions.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to show the Democrats' focus on humanitarian aid versus the Republicans' border security. Highlighting the moral imperative, the urgent need, and the political standoff will capture the essence.

I'll make sure to include Pelosi's quotes to maintain the moral framing. Also, mention the harsh conditions and the deaths of children to underscore the crisis. Finally, note the political dynamics and the approaching recess deadline to show the urgency of passing the bill.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package, despite internal dissent among Democrats and opposition from Republicans. The bill aims to address the humanitarian crisis at the border by providing funding for migrant families and unaccompanied children, including food, shelter, medical care, and legal assistance. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the bill's focus on family unity and humanitarian needs, contrasting it with the Republican-led Senate's approach, which may prioritize border security and a wall. The bill also prohibits funding for Trump's border wall and immigration enforcement. However, the White House threatens to veto the measure, citing its lack of support for border security. The urgency stems from reports of dire conditions, including overcrowded facilities and the deaths of children in custody. The bill faces a political standoff as Congress races to act before a July 4 recess. END OF SUMMARY.
