Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about the House passing a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package. It mentions that top Democrats had to make last-minute changes to get it passed. There was some resistance from progressives and Hispanic lawmakers, but Pelosi managed to quell a mini-revolt. The bill includes funds for sheltering migrants, feeding them, and caring for unaccompanied children. It mandates improved care standards and ensures funds can't be used for the border wall or immigration raids. The Senate has a different bill, and there's a showdown expected. The White House threatens a veto, and some Republicans want more funding for immigration enforcement. The situation is urgent because of reports of poor conditions in detention centers, where children are being held in harsh conditions, and some have died. Agencies are overwhelmed, and there's a rush to pass the bill before the recess.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the author's list. Words like quelled, mini-revolt, prevent, emergency, turning, ensuring, have, care, providing, assistance, protecting, shelter, feed, mandate, standards, ensure, block, used, policies, tear, terrorize, raids, veto, failure, ignoring, score, avoiding, solve, aid, housed, kept, incident, held, died, overwhelmed, depleting, establish, assist, provide, treatment.

I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the moral aspects of the situation.

I'll start by stating the passage of the bill, mention Pelosi's role in quelling the revolt, the funding details, the opposition from Trump, the Senate's stance, the urgency due to the humanitarian crisis, and the consequences of inaction.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is clear, highlighting the need for care, protection, and the failure to act, as well as the opposition's policies tearing apart families and the dire conditions leading to children's deaths.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to include the key points with the moral language, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally.

SUMMARY: The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid package after quelling a mini-revolt among progressives and Hispanic lawmakers. The bill aims to prevent a humanitarian emergency by ensuring care for migrant families and unaccompanied children, providing shelter, food, and medical assistance. It mandates improved standards for children in influx shelters and blocks funding for the border wall or immigration raids. Pelosi emphasized the need to protect families and ensure funds are used for humanitarian purposes. The Senate may propose a different bill, and the White House threatens a veto, arguing the House package lacks funding for border security and detention beds. Agencies are overwhelmed, with reports of dire conditions, including children housed in inadequate facilities and some dying in custody. The urgency to act before a recess highlights the failure to address the plight of immigrant children, as the situation risks political rebuke and accusations of ignoring their suffering. END OF SUMMARY.
