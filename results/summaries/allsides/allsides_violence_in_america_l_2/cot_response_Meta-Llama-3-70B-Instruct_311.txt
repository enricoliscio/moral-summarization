SUMMARY:
Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has said that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. She labeled Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and urged him to "stop the words of hate." A coalition of local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. Trump's polarizing rhetoric has been criticized, and he has been accused of fuelling anger and hostility. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017, and the shooting is considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America. The community is grieving, and fundraising efforts have raised over $600,000 in support. END OF SUMMARY.
