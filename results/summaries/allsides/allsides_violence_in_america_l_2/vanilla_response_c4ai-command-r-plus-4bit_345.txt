SUMMARY: A former president of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting, has said that US President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city. Lynette Lederman told CNN that she does not want the president to visit Pittsburgh, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and saying that his values do not align with those of the city. Her comments were echoed by a coalition of local Jewish leaders who published an open letter stating that Trump is not welcome until he fully denounces white nationalism. Despite the criticism, Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The White House has confirmed the visit amid ongoing debates about the president's divisive rhetoric, which has come under scrutiny following the Pittsburgh shooting and a series of attempted bombings against Democrats and Trump critics. The 11 victims of the shooting have been named, and the suspect, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes. Fundraising efforts have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the grieving community.
END OF SUMMARY.
