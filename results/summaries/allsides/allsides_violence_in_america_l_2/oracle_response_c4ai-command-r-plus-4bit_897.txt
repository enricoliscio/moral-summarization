SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were murdered in a hate-fueled shooting, has labeled Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and said he is not welcome in the city. Lynette Lederman told CNN that she does not want the president to visit Pittsburgh and will rely on local political leadership that stands by values, which she believes Trump does not share. Lederman's comments come as an open letter signed by local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism. Trump, who called the shooting an "evil antisemitic attack", is set to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday despite criticism over his polarizing rhetoric. The shooting, which has been labeled as the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America, has sparked conversations about the rise in antisemitic attacks and hate speech in the US. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes, including murdering victims exercising their religious beliefs. As the community grieves and prepares funeral arrangements, fundraising efforts and solidarity have poured in from various groups.
END OF SUMMARY.
