Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. A former president of the synagogue, Lynette Lederman, says she doesn't want Trump to visit Pittsburgh. She criticizes him for promoting hate speech. There's an open letter from local Jewish leaders also asking Trump not to come until he denounces white nationalism. Trump is scheduled to visit anyway and has been using polarizing rhetoric, even blaming the media as "the true Enemy of the People."

On the other hand, another rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, is welcoming Trump, saying hate isn't a political issue. The article also mentions the victims, the increase in antisemitic attacks, and some fundraising efforts.

I need to capture the moral aspects: Lederman's rejection of Trump's visit due to his hate speech, the open letter, Trump's response, and the contrasting views on whether he should come. Also, the broader context of antisemitism rising.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start with Lederman's statement, mention the open letter, Trump's visit, his media criticism, the rabbi's opposing view, the victims' details, and the increase in antisemitism. End with the fundraising efforts.

Let me make sure the moral framing is clear: Lederman and the coalition are against Trump due to his rhetoric, while others are more neutral. The rise in antisemitism adds context to the moral concern about hate speech.

I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and hits all these points without getting too detailed. Check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has criticized President Donald Trump, stating he is not welcome in the city due to his "purveyor of hate speech" and failure to denounce white nationalism. This follows an open letter from local Jewish leaders urging Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he fully condemns such ideologies. Trump, who labeled the shooting an "evil antisemitic attack," is set to visit the city despite the backlash. Lederman emphasized her reliance on local political leadership rather than the president's visit, highlighting a divide in the community. While some, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcomed Trump, others criticized his polarizing rhetoric and media attacks. The shooting, which killed 11 Jews, is the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, occurring amid a surge in antisemitic incidents. Fundraising efforts have raised significant funds for the affected community. END OF SUMMARY.
