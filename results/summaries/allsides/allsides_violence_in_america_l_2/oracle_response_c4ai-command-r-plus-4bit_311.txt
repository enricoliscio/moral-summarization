SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were murdered in a hate-driven shooting, has labelled Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and said he would not be welcome in the city. Lynette Lederman told CNN she would rely on local political leadership and called on the president to "stop the words of hate" and fully denounce white nationalism. Her comments came as an open letter signed by local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid Pittsburgh, saying he was not welcome until he denounced white nationalism. The president, who is facing criticism for his polarizing rhetoric, labelled the shooting an "evil antisemitic attack" and is set to visit Pittsburgh despite the community's opposition. The shooting, perpetrated by a gunman with no previous criminal record, has been labelled as the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America, with a rise in antisemitic incidents in recent years. The faith community in Squirrel Hill is grieving and preparing funeral arrangements, while also receiving support from various fundraising efforts. The shooter has been charged with 29 federal crimes, including murdering victims exercising their religious beliefs. 

END OF SUMMARY.
