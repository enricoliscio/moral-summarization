SUMMARY:
A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has labelled Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and does not want him to visit the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman relies on local political leadership, who stand by values of love and acceptance, unlike the president's values. A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called for the president to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. Trump has been criticized for his polarizing rhetoric, which has been linked to an increase in antisemitic attacks in the US. The shooter, who traded gunfire with law enforcement officers, was charged with 29 federal crimes, including 11 counts of murdering victims exercising their religious beliefs. The community is grieving and finding "safety in solidarity" as they come together to mourn the loss.
