Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. A former president of the synagogue, Lynette Lederman, says she doesn't want Trump to visit. She called him a "purveyor of hate speech." There's an open letter from local Jewish leaders also asking Trump to stay away. The president is planning to visit on Tuesday.

Trump has been facing criticism for his polarizing rhetoric. He even tweeted about the media being the "Enemy of the People." The article mentions the victims, their ages, and that the shooter was released from the hospital. The Anti-Defamation League notes this is the deadliest attack against Jews in America and that antisemitic incidents have risen.

Another rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, says he welcomes Trump. Fundraising efforts are mentioned, with over $600k raised. The shooter had legal firearms and no prior criminal record.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Lederman's statement, the open letter, Trump's planned visit, his media criticism, the victims, the shooter's background, the ADL's report, Myers' welcome, and the fundraising.

I should structure it clearly, starting with Lederman's comments, then the letter, Trump's response, the victims, the shooter, the ADL info, Myers' stance, and the funds raised. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without going into too much detail.

Let me check the word count. Okay, I think I have all the essential information included without exceeding the limit. Time to put it together.
