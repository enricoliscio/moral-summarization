SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has labeled President Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and stated that he is not welcome in the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman relies on local political leadership and believes in values that Trump does not stand for. A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called for Trump to fully denounce white nationalism before visiting Pittsburgh. The shooting is considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, amid a rise in antisemitic attacks and incidents of harassment and violence. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% increase in such incidents in 2017. Trump's rhetoric has been criticized for being polarizing, and he has been accused of repeating the rhetoric of white supremacists. The community is coming together in solidarity, with fundraising efforts and campaigns to support the grieving families.
