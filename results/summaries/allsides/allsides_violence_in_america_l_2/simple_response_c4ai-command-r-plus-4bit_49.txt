SUMMARY: Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting, has stated that US President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city. Lederman and other local Jewish leaders have criticized Trump's rhetoric, arguing that he is a "purveyor of hate speech" and has contributed to an environment of increasing antisemitism in the US. An open letter signed by a coalition of Jewish leaders also called for Trump to denounce white nationalism before visiting Pittsburgh. Despite the criticism, Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh and continues to use divisive language, blaming the media for causing anger in the country. The Tree of Life rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, has said that he would welcome the president to the city, stating that hate exists in all people regardless of religion or political affiliation. The shooting, carried out by suspected gunman Robert Bowers, has been labeled as an "evil antisemitic attack," with the victims ranging in age from 54 to 97. The Anti-Defamation League has reported a rise in antisemitic attacks, with a 57% increase in reported incidents of harassment and violence in 2017.
