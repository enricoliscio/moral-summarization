SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has said that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman labeled Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and stated that she would rely on local political leadership instead. A coalition of local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. Trump's polarizing rhetoric has been criticized, and he has been accused of fuelling hate speech. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017, and the shooting is considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America. The community is grieving and has received financial support from various fundraising efforts. The shooter, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes, including 11 counts of murder.
