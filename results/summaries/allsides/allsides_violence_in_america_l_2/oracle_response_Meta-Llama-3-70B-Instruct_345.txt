SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has condemned President Trump as a "purveyor of hate speech" and urged him not to visit the city after the deadly antisemitic attack that killed 11 people. Lederman believes the president's rhetoric has contributed to the rise of hate and does not align with the values of the community. She instead relies on local political leadership to stand with the community. A coalition of Jewish leaders has also called on Trump to fully denounce white nationalism before visiting the city. Trump, however, has continued to fuel division by labeling the media as "the true Enemy of the People" and accusing them of inaccurate and fraudulent reporting. The shooting, the deadliest attack on Jewish people in America, has sparked widespread outrage and calls to stop hate speech and violence. The community is coming together to mourn and find safety in solidarity, with fundraising efforts raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in support.
