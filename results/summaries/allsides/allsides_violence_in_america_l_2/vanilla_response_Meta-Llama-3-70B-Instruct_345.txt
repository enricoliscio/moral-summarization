SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman believes Trump is a "purveyor of hate speech" and does not share the values of the community. A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called for Trump to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. Despite this, Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The shooting is being considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, and the Anti-Defamation League has reported a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017. Meanwhile, fundraising efforts have raised over $600,000 for the grieving community.

END OF SUMMARY.
