SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city following the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman labeled Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and said she would rely on local political leadership instead. A coalition of local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday, despite the criticism. The shooting is considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, and comes amid an increase in antisemitic attacks in the US. The victims, ranging in age from 54 to 97, included a husband and wife, two brothers, professors, a dentist, and a physician. Fundraising efforts have raised over $600,000 for the grieving community.
