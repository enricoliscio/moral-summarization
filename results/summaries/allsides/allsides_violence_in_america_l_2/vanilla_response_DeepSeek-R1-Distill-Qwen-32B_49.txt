Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the aftermath of a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. 11 people were killed, which is the deadliest attack on Jewish people in the US. The shooter, Robert Bowers, is charged with 29 federal crimes, including murder. He had no prior criminal record but legally purchased firearms.

There's a lot about the reactions to the shooting. Lynette Lederman, a former synagogue president, doesn't want Trump to visit Pittsburgh, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech." A coalition of Jewish leaders also sent an open letter asking Trump to avoid the city until he denounces white nationalism. However, Trump is planning to visit on Tuesday. He also criticized the media, calling them "the true Enemy of the People."

On the other hand, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers from the same synagogue is welcoming Trump, saying hate isn't a political issue. Fundraising efforts are underway to support the community, with over $600,000 raised so far.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) notes a rise in antisemitic incidents and fears that hate is becoming mainstream due to political rhetoric.

So, the key points are:
- Pittsburgh synagogue shooting with 11 deaths.
- Trump's planned visit and criticism from some community leaders.
- ADL's concern about rising antisemitism.
- Fundraising efforts and community support.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first mention the shooting and its significance, then the community's mixed reactions to Trump's visit, followed by the ADL's comments, and finally the fundraising efforts.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear and concise. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically from one point to the next.
