SUMMARY:

Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. She labels Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and believes his values do not align with those of the community. A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called for Trump to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. This comes as Trump faces criticism for his polarizing rhetoric, which many believe has contributed to the rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. The shooting is being called the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, and the ADL has reported a 57% rise in antisemitic harassment and violence in 2017. While some faith leaders have welcomed Trump's visit, others have condemned his rhetoric and actions.
