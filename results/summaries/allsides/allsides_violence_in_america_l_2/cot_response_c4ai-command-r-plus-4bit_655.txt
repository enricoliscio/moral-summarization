SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were brutally murdered in an evil antisemitic attack, has labelled Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and declared that he is not welcome in the city. Lynette Lederman stated that she does not want the president to visit Pittsburgh and will instead rely on local political leadership. Lederman's comments come as an open letter signed by Jewish leaders also calls for Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism. Despite the criticism, Trump continues to use polarizing rhetoric, blaming the media for causing anger in the country and labelling them "the true Enemy of the People". The deadly attack has brought attention to the rise in antisemitic attacks and hate speech in the US, with the Anti-Defamation League reporting a significant increase in antisemitic incidents. As the community grieves and funeral arrangements are made, fundraising efforts have driven financial support to those affected by this horrible tragedy. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with multiple crimes and is expected to face justice in court. END OF SUMMARY.
