SUMMARY: Following a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, former synagogue president Lynette Lederman has stated that US President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city, citing his role as a "purveyor of hate speech" and his failure to denounce white nationalism. Lederman's stance aligns with an open letter signed by local Jewish leaders, urging the President to refrain from visiting Pittsburgh until he fully rejects white nationalist ideologies. This incident highlights the increasing concerns about antisemitic attacks and the normalization of hate speech in American society. Despite the criticism, President Trump plans to visit Pittsburgh, while Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life Synagogue has expressed a willingness to welcome the President. The shooting, perpetrated by a suspect with no prior criminal record and legally purchased firearms, resulted in the tragic loss of 11 lives and injured six others, including four police officers. The tragedy has sparked fundraising efforts and calls for unity and solidarity against hate and intolerance.
END OF SUMMARY.
