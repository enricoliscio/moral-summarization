SUMMARY: In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that left 11 people dead, former Tree of Life Synagogue president Lynette Lederman has stated that President Trump is not welcome in the city. Lederman and other local Jewish leaders have criticized Trump's rhetoric, accusing him of being a "purveyor of hate speech" and demanding that he fully denounce white nationalism. Despite this, Trump is still scheduled to visit Pittsburgh, and continues to face criticism for his polarizing language. 

The shooting has been labeled as the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America, with the Anti-Defamation League reporting a rise in antisemitic attacks and rhetoric in recent years. The suspect, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes and is expected to face court. 

While some members of the faith community, such as Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, have stated that Trump is welcome to visit Pittsburgh, Lederman and other local leaders are standing firm in their belief that Trump's presence is not desired due to his failure to denounce hate and promote values of unity and tolerance. The community is instead seeking support through fundraising efforts and solidarity from people of all faiths. 

END OF SUMMARY.
