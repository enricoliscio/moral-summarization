SUMMARY: Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting, has stated that US President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city. Lederman and other local Jewish leaders have accused Trump of perpetuating hate speech and white nationalism, and believe his presence would be inappropriate given the tragic circumstances. This stance is in response to the president's divisive rhetoric and his failure to denounce white supremacy fully. The shooting, which has been labeled as an "evil antisemitic attack," has brought attention to the rise in antisemitic attacks and hate speech in the US. Despite criticism, Trump is scheduled to visit Pittsburgh and has continued to use Twitter to blame the media for causing anger and hostility in the country. The shooting suspect, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes and is expected to appear in court. The tragedy has prompted an outpouring of support and fundraising efforts for the grieving community.

END OF SUMMARY.
