SUMMARY: Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting, has stated that US President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city. Lederman accused Trump of being a "purveyor of hate speech" and criticized his polarizing rhetoric, which has come under scrutiny following the shooting and recent attempted bombings against Democrats. An open letter signed by local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism. Despite the opposition, Trump is scheduled to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life Synagogue has said he would welcome the president, stating that hate exists in all people regardless of their background. The shooting, carried out by suspected gunman Robert Bowers, has been labeled as the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America. Bowers has been charged with 29 federal crimes and released from the hospital, awaiting court proceedings. The shooting has sparked fundraising efforts for the community, with Muslims Unite for Pittsburgh Synagogue raising over $90,000 and another fundraiser collecting nearly $545,000.
