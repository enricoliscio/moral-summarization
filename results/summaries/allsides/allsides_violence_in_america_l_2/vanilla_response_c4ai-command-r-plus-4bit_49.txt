SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting, has said that Donald Trump is not welcome in the city and labeled him a "purveyor of hate speech". Lynette Lederman told CNN that she would rely on local political leadership in the aftermath of the tragedy and did not want the president to visit. Her comments were echoed by a coalition of local Jewish leaders who published an open letter stating that Trump was not welcome until he fully denounced white nationalism. Despite the criticism, Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the rabbi of the Tree of Life Synagogue, Jeffrey Myers, said that he would welcome the president, adding that hate exists in all people regardless of their background. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes and is expected to appear in court. The shooting has been labeled the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America, and the Anti-Defamation League has reported a rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. Funeral arrangements are being made for the victims, and fundraising efforts have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the grieving community.
END OF SUMMARY.
