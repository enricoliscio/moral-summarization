SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were killed in a hate-motivated shooting, has labeled Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and said he is not welcome in the city. Lynette Lederman stated that she does not want the president to visit Pittsburgh and will instead rely on local political leadership. Lederman's comments were echoed by a coalition of local Jewish leaders, who also called for Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism. Despite the criticism, Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. In the wake of the shooting and a series of attempted bombings, Trump has continued to label the media as "the true Enemy of the People". The shooting has been identified as the deadliest antisemitic attack in America, with the Anti-Defamation League reporting a rise in antisemitic incidents. Faith leaders in Squirrel Hill are preparing funeral arrangements, and fundraising efforts have been providing financial support to the grieving community. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes, including murdering victims exercising their religious beliefs.
END OF SUMMARY.
