Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the reactions from various people and groups. 

First, Lynette Lederman, a former president of the synagogue, says she doesn't want Trump to visit Pittsburgh. She calls him a "purveyor of hate speech." There's an open letter from local Jewish leaders also asking Trump not to come until he denounces white nationalism. 

Then, Trump is planning to visit on Tuesday, according to the White House. He labeled the shooting as an "evil antisemitic attack." But he also criticized the media, calling them the "true Enemy of the People" for inaccurate reporting.

The shooter, Robert Bowers, is charged with 29 crimes, including 11 murders. He was released from the hospital and is going to court. The victims are eight men and three women, aged 54 to 97, including a husband and wife, brothers, professors, dentist, and physician. The ADL says this is the deadliest attack against Jews in America, with a 57% increase in antisemitic incidents in 2017.

Jeffrey Myers, the rabbi, says he welcomes Trump, believing hate isn't a political issue. Fundraising efforts are underway, with over $600k raised so far. The shooter had legally purchased firearms and had no prior criminal record.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on key points: Lederman's statement, the open letter, Trump's visit and media criticism, the shooter's background, the victims, ADL's stats, the rabbi's stance, and fundraising.

I'll structure it by starting with Lederman's opposition to Trump's visit, mention the open letter, Trump's planned visit and media comments. Then detail the shooting's impact, the victims, ADL's statistics, the rabbi's differing opinion, and the fundraising efforts. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without going over the word limit.
