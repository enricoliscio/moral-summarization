Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also provided a specific structure to follow, which includes two steps. First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I have to write a summary using those words as much as possible.

Looking at the article, I see several terms that carry moral connotations. Words like "hate speech," "antisemitic," "hostility," "fraudulent," "Enemy of the People," and "welcome" stand out. These words are used to convey strong moral judgments about the president's actions and statements.

Next, I need to craft a concise summary that includes these terms. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article, focusing on the moral aspects highlighted. I'll mention Lynette Lederman's statement about the president not being welcome, the open letter from Jewish leaders, and the president's response. I'll also include the rabbi's opposing view and the context of the shooting and its impact.

I should make sure to preserve the moral framing by using the identified words and maintaining the tone of the original article. It's important to highlight the divide between the community's reaction and the president's rhetoric, as well as the broader implications of the shooting on antisemitism in the US.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce Lederman's stance, then the president's visit and his Twitter response, followed by the rabbi's opposing view, and conclude with the context of the attack and its significance. This should effectively convey the moral dimensions discussed in the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Lynette Lederman, a former synagogue president in Pittsburgh, has condemned President Trump as a "purveyor of hate speech" and stated he is not welcome in the city following the deadly antisemitic attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue. She criticized Trump's values and called on local leadership instead. A coalition of Jewish leaders echoed her stance, urging Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism. Trump, who labeled the attack an "evil antisemitic attack," is set to visit the city. Meanwhile, Trump accused the media of being the "Enemy of the People," citing inaccurate and hostile reporting. The shooter, Robert Bowers, faces charges for murdering 11 victims, including eight men and three women, during the attack. The Anti-Defamation League noted a rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017, linking the attack to a broader normalization of hate rhetoric. Some community leaders, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcomed Trump, arguing hate transcends politics. Fundraising efforts have raised significant funds for the affected community. The shooter, legally armed, injured six others and had no prior criminal record. END OF SUMMARY.
