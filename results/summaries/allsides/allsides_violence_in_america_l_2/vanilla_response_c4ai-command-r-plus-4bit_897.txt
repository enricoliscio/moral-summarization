SUMMARY: A former president of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting, has said that Donald Trump is not welcome in the city, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech". Lynette Lederman told CNN that she would rely on local political leadership and did not want the president to visit, citing his divisive values. An open letter signed by local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to stay away from Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism. Despite the criticism, Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The White House has confirmed the visit amidst ongoing accusations of the president's polarizing rhetoric, with some arguing that his words have contributed to the recent increase in hate crimes and antisemitic attacks in the US. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes and is expected to appear in court. The victims of the shooting have been identified as eight men and three women, ranging in age from 54 to 97 years old. Fundraising efforts have been successful, with various campaigns raising over $600,000 for the grieving community.
END OF SUMMARY.
