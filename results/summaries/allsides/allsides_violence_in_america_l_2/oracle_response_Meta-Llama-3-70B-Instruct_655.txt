SUMMARY:

Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has labelled President Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and stated that he is not welcome in the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman believes that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to the "hate" and "antisemitic attacks" that have risen 57% in 2017, according to the Anti-Defamation League. She urged Trump to "stop the words of hate" and "denounce white nationalism". A coalition of local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. Trump, however, has continued to blame the media, calling them the "true Enemy of the People" and accusing them of "inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news". The shooting, which is the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America, has sparked widespread outrage and calls for action against "hate" and "antisemitism".
