SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman labeled Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and said she would rely on local political leadership instead. A coalition of local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid the city until he fully denounces white nationalism. Trump's visit to Pittsburgh is scheduled for Tuesday, despite criticism over his polarizing rhetoric. The shooting is being considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, amid a rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. The community is coming together to mourn and support each other, with fundraising efforts reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars.
