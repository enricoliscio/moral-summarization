SUMMARY:
Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has stated that US President Donald Trump is "not welcome" in the city following the tragic mass shooting that took the lives of 11 people. Lederman and other local Jewish leaders have called on the President to denounce white nationalism and stop the spread of hateful rhetoric. Trump, who labeled the shooting an "evil antisemitic attack," is still set to visit Pittsburgh despite the community's concerns. 

The Tree of Life Synagogue shooting has been identified as the deadliest attack on Jewish people in America, with suspected gunman Robert Bowers charged with 29 federal crimes, including hate-motivated murders. The incident has brought attention to the rise in antisemitic attacks and harassment in the US, with an increase of 57% reported incidents in 2017. 

Lederman and other signatories of an open letter have urged political leaders to "stop the words of hate" and stand against white nationalism. They view Trump's divisive rhetoric as contributing to the anger and hostility in the country and believe he is a "purveyor of hate speech." 

While some faith leaders in Squirrel Hill, including Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, have stated that Trump is welcome to visit, others in the community are grieving and finding solace in solidarity, with fundraising efforts providing financial support. The community is calling for an end to hateful rhetoric and for leaders to uphold values of unity and respect.
