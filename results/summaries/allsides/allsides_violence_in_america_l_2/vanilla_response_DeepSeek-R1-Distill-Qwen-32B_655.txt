Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. A former president of the synagogue, Lynette Lederman, says she doesn't want Trump to visit Pittsburgh because she thinks he promotes hate speech. She relies on local leaders instead. There's an open letter from Jewish leaders also asking Trump not to come until he denounces white nationalism. Trump is planning to visit anyway and has criticized the media as "the true Enemy of the People." The shooting was antisemitic, with 11 deaths, including a husband, wife, and two brothers. The suspect, Robert Bowers, used an AR-15 and had no criminal record. The ADL notes a rise in antisemitic attacks. Some in the community, like Rabbi Myers, welcome Trump. Fundraising efforts are helping the community.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll focus on the key points: Lederman's statement against Trump, the shooting details, the suspect's background, the ADL's comments, and the mixed reactions to Trump's visit. I'll make sure to include the main events and reactions without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with Lederman's opposition, mention the shooting and its impact, the suspect's background, the ADL's statistics, the mixed community reactions, and the fundraising efforts. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: Lynette Lederman, a former president of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, where 11 were killed in a mass shooting, has criticized President Donald Trump, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and stating he is unwelcome in Pittsburgh. This follows an open letter from local Jewish leaders urging Trump to avoid the city until he denounces white nationalism. Trump, who has labeled the attack an "evil antisemitic attack," is set to visit Pittsburgh despite criticism over his polarizing rhetoric. The shooting, carried out by Robert Bowers, who shouted antisemitic slurs, is the deadliest attack on Jewish people in U.S. history. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017. Meanwhile, some community leaders, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcome Trump's visit, emphasizing unity over politics. Fundraising efforts have raised significant funds for the affected community. END OF SUMMARY.
