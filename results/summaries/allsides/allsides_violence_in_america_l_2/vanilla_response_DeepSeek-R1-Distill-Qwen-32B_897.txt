Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. A former president of the synagogue, Lynette Lederman, says she doesn't want Trump to visit. She criticizes him for hate speech. There's an open letter from local Jewish leaders also asking Trump not to come. Trump is planning to visit on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, another rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, says he's welcome. Trump is blaming the media, calling them the enemy. The shooter, Robert Bowers, is charged with 29 crimes, including 11 murders. He had no prior criminal record but legally bought his guns. The attack was the deadliest against Jews in the US, and there's been an increase in antisemitic incidents.

Fundraising efforts are helping the community. The article mentions the victims' backgrounds and the impact on the Jewish community.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on key points: Lederman's statement, the open letter, Trump's visit, the rabbi's support, Trump's media criticism, shooter's background, the attack's significance, and community support.

I should structure it clearly, making sure to include all main elements without getting too detailed. Keep it concise and cover all important aspects.
