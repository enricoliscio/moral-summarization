*SUMMARY:
A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were murdered in an antisemitic attack, has said that Donald Trump is not welcome in the city. Lynette Lederman labeled Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and called on local political leadership to stop the words of hate. Lederman's comments come as the White House confirmed Trump's visit to Pittsburgh on Tuesday, despite criticism over his polarizing rhetoric and the recent series of attempted bombings targeting Democrats and Trump critics. The Pittsburgh chapter of Bend The Arc, a progressive advocacy group, also released an open letter stating that Trump is not welcome until he fully denounces white nationalism. In the wake of the shooting, the Anti-Defamation League reported a rise in antisemitic incidents, harassment, and violence in the US, with an increase in the mainstreaming of hate and white supremacist rhetoric. The shooting, perpetrated by suspected gunman Robert Bowers, resulted in the murder of eight men and three women, ranging from 54 to 97 years old. Bowers has been charged with 29 federal crimes, including 11 counts of murdering victims exercising their religious beliefs. As Squirrel Hill mourners grieved and found safety in solidarity, faith leaders prepared funeral arrangements. Despite the tragedy, the Tree of Life rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, stated that he would welcome the president to the city, choosing not to foist blame. Fundraising efforts have driven financial support to the grieving community, with Muslims Unite for Pittsburgh Synagogue raising over $90,000. The suspect, who injured six others and exchanged gunfire with police, had no prior criminal record and legally purchased his firearms.
