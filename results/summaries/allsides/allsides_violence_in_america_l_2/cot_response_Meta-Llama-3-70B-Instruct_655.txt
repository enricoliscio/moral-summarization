SUMMARY:
A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has said that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city, labelling him a "purveyor of hate speech". Lederman relies on local political leadership and does not want the president to visit the city, citing that Trump's values are not aligned with hers. This comes after a mass shooting at the synagogue, where 11 people were murdered, and Trump's polarizing rhetoric has been criticized. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% rise in antisemitic harassment and violence in 2017, and the shooting is considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America. The community is grieving, and fundraising efforts have raised significant amounts of money. Trump has been accused of using "hate speech" and has been criticized for his response to the attack.
