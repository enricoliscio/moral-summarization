SUMMARY: In the wake of a devastating mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, former synagogue president Lynette Lederman has taken a strong stance against hate speech and white nationalism. Lederman has stated that US President Donald Trump, known for his polarizing rhetoric, is not welcome in Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism and changes his hateful ways. This sentiment is echoed by a coalition of local Jewish leaders who have published an open letter expressing their disapproval of Trump's visit to the city. Despite the tragedy, the community has come together to support each other, with various fundraising efforts raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the grieving community. Unfortunately, the shooting, perpetrated by suspected gunman Robert Bowers, resulted in the deaths of 11 people and injuries to six others, including four police officers. The attack has been labeled as the most deadly against Jewish people in America, and it serves as a stark reminder of the rising antisemitism and hate crimes in the country. END OF SUMMARY.
