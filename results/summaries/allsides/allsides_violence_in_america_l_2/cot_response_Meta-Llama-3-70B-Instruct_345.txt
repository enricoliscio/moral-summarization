SUMMARY:
A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has labelled Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and does not want him to visit the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman believes the president's values are not aligned with those of the community, which are based on "values, not just Jewish, but values". A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called for Trump to fully denounce white nationalism before visiting Pittsburgh. The shooting is considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, amid a rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. The community is grieving and has received financial support from various fundraising efforts. Trump has been criticized for his polarizing rhetoric and has labelled the media as "the true Enemy of the People". END OF SUMMARY.
