SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city following the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman labeled Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and urged him to fully denounce white nationalism before visiting. A coalition of local Jewish leaders also published an open letter calling for Trump to avoid the city until he condemns white nationalism. Trump's polarizing rhetoric has been criticized, and his recent tweet labeling the media as "the true Enemy of the People" has sparked outrage. The shooting is being considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, and the Anti-Defamation League has reported a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017. The community is grieving and calling for an end to hate speech and violence.
