SUMMARY:

A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has condemned President Trump's rhetoric, labeling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and stating that he is not welcome in the city. Lederman's comments come after a mass shooting at the synagogue, where 11 people were murdered, and amid a rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% increase in antisemitic harassment and violence in 2017. Lederman urged leaders to "stop the words of hate" and denounced Trump's failure to fully reject white nationalism. Trump, who plans to visit Pittsburgh, has been criticized for his polarizing rhetoric, which many believe has contributed to the toxic environment that fosters hate crimes. The synagogue's current rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, took a more conciliatory tone, saying that hate knows no religion or political party and welcoming Trump to the city. However, many in the community, including local Jewish leaders, have called for Trump to stay away until he fully denounces white nationalism. END OF SUMMARY.
