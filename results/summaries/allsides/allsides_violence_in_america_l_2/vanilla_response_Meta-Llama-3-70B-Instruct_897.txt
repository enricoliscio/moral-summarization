SUMMARY:

Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city following the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman believes Trump is a "purveyor of hate speech" and does not share the values of the community. A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called for Trump to avoid visiting Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism. Despite this, Trump is set to visit the city on Tuesday. The shooting is being considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, with a 57% rise in reported incidents of antisemitic harassment and violence in 2017. The community is coming together to mourn and raise funds, with crowdfunding campaigns exceeding $600,000.
