Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral angles involved.

The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, where 11 people were killed. A former president of the synagogue, Lynette Lederman, is speaking out against President Trump visiting Pittsburgh. She calls him a "purveyor of hate speech" and says he's not welcome. There's an open letter from local Jewish leaders also urging Trump to stay away until he denounces white nationalism. On the other hand, another rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, says he's welcome because hate isn't a political issue. Trump is scheduled to visit despite criticism over his polarizing rhetoric. There's also mention of an increase in antisemitic attacks, with the ADL noting a 57% rise in 2017, and the shooter's backgroundâ€”no criminal record, legally purchased firearms, and antisemitic posts before the attack.

The moral framing here is about the community's reaction to Trump's leadership and rhetoric in the wake of the tragedy. Lederman is criticizing Trump for his hate speech, while Myers is taking a more neutral stance. The article also touches on the broader issue of rising antisemitism and the impact of political rhetoric on such events.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, highlighting the key moral points: Lederman's rejection of Trump, the open letter, Trump's planned visit despite criticism, the rabbi's opposing view, the increase in antisemitism, and the shooter's background.

I should structure the summary to first mention the shooting, then Lederman's statement, the open letter, Trump's visit and criticism, the opposing rabbi's view, the statistics on antisemitism, and the shooter's background. I need to keep it concise but include all these elements while preserving the moral critique towards Trump's rhetoric.

Let me draft that, making sure not to exceed 200 words and to maintain the moral perspective presented in the original article.

SUMMARY: Following the tragic Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Lynette Lederman, a former synagogue president, criticized President Trump, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and stating he is unwelcome in Pittsburgh. A local Jewish coalition echoed this sentiment, urging Trump to avoid the city until he denounces white nationalism. Despite this, Trump is set to visit, facing criticism for his polarizing rhetoric. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, however, welcomed Trump, arguing hate transcends politics. The attack, the deadliest against Jews in America, occurred amid a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017, as reported by the ADL. The shooter, with no criminal record, legally purchased firearms and posted antisemitic content before the attack. END OF SUMMARY.
