SUMMARY: A former president of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting, has said Donald Trump is "not welcome" in the city. Lynette Lederman told CNN she did not want the president to visit Pittsburgh and labelled him a "purveyor of hate speech". Her comments came as an open letter signed by local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to stay away, saying he must "fully denounce white nationalism" first. The White House confirmed Trump would visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday, despite the criticism. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes, including 11 counts of murder. He is accused of using an AR-15 rifle and three handguns in the attack and is said to have posted antisemitic rants online. The shooting has been labelled the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America, with the Anti-Defamation League reporting a rise in antisemitic incidents in recent years. Fundraising efforts for the grieving community have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars.
END OF SUMMARY.
