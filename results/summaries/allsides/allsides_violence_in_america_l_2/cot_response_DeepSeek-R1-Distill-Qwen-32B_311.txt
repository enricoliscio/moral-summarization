Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting where 11 people were killed. Lynette Lederman, a former synagogue president, criticizes Trump, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and says he's not welcome in Pittsburgh. There's an open letter from local Jewish leaders asking Trump to avoid the city until he denounces white nationalism. Trump is planning to visit, though, and he's blaming the media as "the true Enemy of the People," accusing them of inaccurate reporting.

There's also mention of the increase in antisemitic attacks, with the ADL noting a 57% rise in 2017. The shooter, Robert Bowers, had no prior criminal record but used legally purchased firearms. The community is fundraising to support the victims' families, with over $600k raised.

In terms of moral framing, words like "hate speech," "Enemy of the People," "fraudulent," "hostility," "antisemitic," "mainstream," "public life," "harassment," "violence," "solidarity," "donate," "generous," "grace," "respect," "tolerance," and "peace" stand out. These words carry strong moral connotations, indicating blame, criticism, or praise.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible while keeping it concise. I should structure it to highlight Lederman's criticism of Trump, the open letter, Trump's response, the attack details, the ADL's statistics, the shooter's background, and the community's response.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the shooting, moving to the reactions from Lederman and the coalition, Trump's planned visit and his media criticism, the attack's details, the rise in antisemitism, the shooter's background, and the community's fundraising efforts.

I need to make sure not to exceed 200 words and include the morally charged terms to preserve the author's framing. Let me draft that.
