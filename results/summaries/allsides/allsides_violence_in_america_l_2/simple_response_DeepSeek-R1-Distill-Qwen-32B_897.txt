Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting where 11 people were killed. Lynette Lederman, a former synagogue president, is speaking out against Trump's visit, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech." She prefers local leadership over the president's presence. A coalition of Jewish leaders also sent an open letter asking Trump not to visit until he denounces white nationalism.

On the other hand, another rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, supports Trump's visit, saying hate isn't political and the president is welcome. The article also mentions the rise in antisemitic attacks, the suspect's background, and the fundraising efforts by the community.

I need to capture these points concisely, making sure to highlight the moral stances: Lederman's rejection of Trump and the rabbi's support, along with the broader context of antisemitism and community response.

I should structure the summary to include:
- The shooting incident.
- Lederman's statement against Trump.
- The coalition's letter.
- The rabbi's opposing view.
- The increase in antisemitic incidents.
- The suspect's background.
- Community support and fundraising.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key moral elements.

SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has condemned President Donald Trump, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and stating he is unwelcome in the city following the mass shooting that killed 11 Jewish worshippers. Lederman emphasized her reliance on local leadership over the president's visit, aligning with a coalition of Jewish leaders who also urged Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism. Meanwhile, another rabbi at the synagogue, Jeffrey Myers, welcomed Trump, arguing that hate transcends politics and that the president should be received as a national leader. The attack, the deadliest against Jewish people in the U.S., occurred amid a rise in antisemitic incidents, with the suspect, Robert Bowers, legally purchasing firearms and reportedly posting antisemitic content online. Community solidarity has been strong, with fundraising efforts raising significant funds for the affected families. END OF SUMMARY.
