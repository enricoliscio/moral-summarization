Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, where 11 people were killed. A former president of the synagogue, Lynette Lederman, says she doesn't want Trump to visit Pittsburgh and calls him a "purveyor of hate speech." There's an open letter from local Jewish leaders asking Trump to stay away until he denounces white nationalism. Trump is planning to visit anyway and has been criticizing the media as the "enemy of the people." The article also mentions the rise in antisemitic attacks, the shooter's background, and community support efforts.

Now, I need to structure the summary. I should start with the shooting, mention Lederman's stance against Trump, the letter from the Jewish leaders, Trump's planned visit, his media criticism, the statistics on antisemitism, the shooter's actions, and the community's response with fundraising.

I need to use the morally framed words from the list. Words like "purveyor," "hate speech," "denounce," "antisemitic," "attack," "massacre," "enemy," "fraudulent," "harassment," "violence," "solidarity," "fundraiser," etc., should be included where appropriate.

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting too bogged down in details. I'll also keep an eye on the word count to stay under 200 words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the key moral terms and maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY:  
Lynette Lederman, a former president of Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue, where 11 were murdered, condemned President Trump as a "purveyor of hate speech" and urged him not to visit the city. She criticized his values, stating they do not align with those of the community. A coalition of local Jewish leaders echoed this sentiment in an open letter, calling on Trump to denounce white nationalism before visiting. Trump, who labeled the attack an "evil antisemitic attack," plans to visit Pittsburgh despite criticism of his polarizing rhetoric. He also accused the media of being the "enemy of the people," citing inaccurate and fraudulent reporting. The shooting, the deadliest against Jewish people in the U.S., occurred amid a rise in antisemitic incidents, with the Anti-Defamation League noting a 57% increase in 2017. The suspect, Robert Bowers, allegedly shouted antisemitic slurs during the massacre, injuring six others, including police. Meanwhile, some community leaders, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcomed Trump's visit, emphasizing unity over political blame. Fundraising efforts, including a campaign raising over $90,000, have provided support to the grieving community. END OF SUMMARY.
