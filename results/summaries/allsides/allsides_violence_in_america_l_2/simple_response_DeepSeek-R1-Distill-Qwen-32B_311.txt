Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the key points and the underlying moral stance. Let me read through the article again.

The main points are about Lynette Lederman, the former synagogue president, not wanting Trump to visit Pittsburgh after the shooting. She criticizes him for promoting hate speech. There's also a letter from local Jewish leaders asking Trump to stay away until he denounces white nationalism. On the other hand, another rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, is welcoming Trump, saying hate isn't political.

I should note the context: the synagogue attack was the deadliest against Jews in the US, with an 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017. Trump's response includes blaming the media and calling them the "Enemy of the People." Also, the shooter had no prior record but had legally purchased firearms.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Lederman's rejection of Trump's visit, the letter, and the moral criticism. Then, contrast it with Myers' stance. Include the attack details, the ADL stats, and Trump's media criticism. Finally, mention the shooter's background and the fundraising efforts.

Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like hate speech, values, and the community's response. Keep it balanced but reflect the author's perspective on Trump's role in the situation. Okay, I think that covers the main points without going over the word limit.

Lederman emphasized her reliance on local political leadership and accused Trump of not sharing the community's values. A coalition of local Jewish leaders also urged Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism. Trump, who described the attack as an "evil antisemitic attack," is set to visit the city. Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League noted a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017, highlighting the mainstreaming of antisemitism. Another rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, welcomed Trump, stating hate is not a political issue. The shooter, Robert Bowers, purchased his firearms legally and had no prior criminal record.
