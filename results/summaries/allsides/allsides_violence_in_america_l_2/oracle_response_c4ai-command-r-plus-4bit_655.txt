SUMMARY: A former president of the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were murdered in a shooting has labelled Donald Trump a “purveyor of hate speech” and said the president is “not welcome” in the city. Lynette Lederman of the Tree of Life Synagogue said she did not want Trump to visit Pittsburgh and would instead rely on local political leadership. Her comments came as an open letter signed by local Jewish leaders also called for Trump to avoid the city until he “fully denounces white nationalism”. The letter stated that the president's rhetoric has contributed to an increase in antisemitic attacks and incidents of hate in the US. Trump has faced widespread criticism for his polarizing language, including his recent attacks on the media as “the true Enemy of the People”. Meanwhile, faith leaders in Squirrel Hill are preparing funeral arrangements for those killed in the deadly shooting and are receiving support from various fundraising efforts. The suspected gunman, Robert Bowers, has been charged with 29 federal crimes, including murdering victims exercising their religious beliefs.
END OF SUMMARY.
