Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points and the underlying messages about morality and values.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting where 11 people were killed. A former president of the synagogue, Lynette Lederman, is speaking out against President Trump, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and saying he's not welcome in Pittsburgh. There's also a letter from local Jewish leaders urging Trump to avoid the city until he denounces white nationalism. Trump is planning to visit, though, and he's criticized the media as "the true Enemy of the People."

I need to include the moral aspects here. Lederman's rejection of Trump is based on his values, which she sees as opposing the community's values. The article also mentions the rise in antisemitic attacks, which ties into the broader issue of hate and the role of leadership in addressing it. The rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, offers a different perspective, welcoming Trump and emphasizing that hate isn't a political issue, which is another moral stance.

I should also mention the fundraising efforts, showing solidarity and support, which is a positive moral action. The shooter's background and his use of legal firearms are details that contribute to the context of the tragedy but might not be the main moral points.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral framing. I'll structure it by highlighting Lederman's stance against Trump, the letter from Jewish leaders, Trump's planned visit and media criticism, the community's response, and the contrasting views on whether Trump should be welcomed.

I should avoid going into too much detail about the shooter's background unless it's relevant to the moral issues. The key is to focus on the values and the divide between different groups' responses to the tragedy.

Let me outline the points:
1. Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the victims.
2. Lynette Lederman's rejection of Trump, calling him a purveyor of hate.
3. Letter from Jewish leaders urging Trump to avoid the city.
4. Trump's planned visit and his criticism of the media.
5. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers' welcoming of Trump, stating hate isn't political.
6. Fundraising efforts showing solidarity.
7. Context of rising antisemitism and the shooter's background.

Now, I'll condense these points into a coherent summary, making sure to highlight the moral perspectives and the divide between the community leaders and Trump's approach.

SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Lynette Lederman, has condemned President Trump, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and stating he is unwelcome in the city following the mass shooting that killed 11 Jewish worshippers. Lederman emphasized the community's values of unity and rejected Trump's rhetoric, which she sees as incompatible with their principles. A coalition of local Jewish leaders echoed this sentiment in an open letter, urging Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism. Despite this, Trump is set to visit the city, a move met with criticism as he continues to face backlash for his polarizing statements. Meanwhile, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers welcomed Trump, arguing that hate transcends politics. The tragedy has sparked widespread solidarity, with fundraising efforts raising significant funds for the affected community. The shooting, the deadliest against Jews in the U.S., highlights a rise in antisemitism, with the suspect using legal firearms and expressing antisemitic views before the attack. END OF SUMMARY.
