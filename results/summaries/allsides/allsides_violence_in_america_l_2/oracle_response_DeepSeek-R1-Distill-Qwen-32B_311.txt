Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without making it too longâ€”under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the president's response, and the community's reaction. The key moral words are things like "purveyor of hate speech," "antisemitic," "massacre," and "solidarity." 

I should start by mentioning the shooting and the victims. Then, talk about Lynette Lederman's statement about Trump not being welcome. Include the coalition's call for Trump to denounce white nationalism. Also, note Trump's visit and his tweet about the media. 

Next, include the details about the shooter, the increase in antisemitic incidents, and the community's support efforts. Highlight the rabbi's contrasting view on welcoming Trump. Finally, mention the fundraising efforts and the overall impact of hate.

I need to keep it concise, using the moral terms where they fit naturally. Make sure the summary flows well and covers all critical points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were murdered in a mass shooting, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech." She emphasized her reliance on local political leadership and criticized Trump's values, which she said do not align with those of the community. A coalition of local Jewish leaders also urged Trump to avoid Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism. Trump, who labeled the shooting an "evil antisemitic attack," is set to visit the city. Meanwhile, the president continued to criticize the media, calling them "the true Enemy of the People" for their reporting. The shooting, described as the deadliest attack against Jewish people in America, saw the gunman, Robert Bowers, charged with murdering victims exercising their religious beliefs. The Anti-Defamation League noted a rise in antisemitic incidents in 2017, linking the attack to a broader trend of hate rhetoric. Some community leaders, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcomed Trump, arguing hate transcends politics. Fundraising efforts, including a campaign by Muslims, have raised significant support for the grieving community. The suspect, who purchased firearms legally, injured six others and exchanged gunfire with police during the massacre. END OF SUMMARY.
