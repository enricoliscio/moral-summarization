SUMMARY:
Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has rejected President Trump's potential visit to the city, labelling him a "purveyor of hate speech". Lederman instead relies on local political leadership, who she believes stand by values of inclusivity and reject hate. This comes after a mass shooting at the synagogue, which the Anti-Defamation League reported as the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America. The shooting has sparked outrage, with many criticizing Trump's polarizing rhetoric and failure to fully denounce white nationalism. The president has responded by tweeting that the media is the "true Enemy of the People", sparking further criticism. As the community mourns and prepares for funerals, a crowdfunding campaign has raised over $540,000 in support. END OF SUMMARY.
