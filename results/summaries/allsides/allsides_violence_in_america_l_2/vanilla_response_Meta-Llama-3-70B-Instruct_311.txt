SUMMARY:

Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has stated that President Donald Trump is not welcome in the city following the mass shooting that killed 11 people. Lederman believes Trump is a "purveyor of hate speech" and that his values do not align with those of the community. A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called for Trump to avoid visiting Pittsburgh until he fully denounces white nationalism. Despite this, the White House has confirmed that Trump will visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The shooting is being considered the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America, and it comes amid a rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. The victims of the shooting have been named, and fundraising efforts have raised over $600,000 to support the grieving community.
