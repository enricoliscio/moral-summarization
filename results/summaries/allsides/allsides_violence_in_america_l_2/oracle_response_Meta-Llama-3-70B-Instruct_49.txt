SUMMARY:

Lynette Lederman, a former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, has labeled President Donald Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and does not want him to visit the city after the mass shooting that killed 11 people. She will rely on local political leadership, who "stand by us" and "believe in values" that are not shared by the president. A coalition of local Jewish leaders has also called on Trump to "fully denounce white nationalism" before visiting Pittsburgh. Trump's polarizing rhetoric has been criticized, and he has been accused of fueling an environment of "antisemitism" that has led to a "rise" in "incidents" of "harassment" and "violence". The Anti-Defamation League reported a 57% increase in such incidents in 2017. The shooting is considered the most "deadly attack" against Jewish people in America. In contrast, Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers has welcomed Trump to the city, saying "hate does not know religion, race, creed, or political party".
