SUMMARY: A former president of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, where 11 people were murdered in a hate-driven shooting, has labelled Donald Trump a “purveyor of hate speech” and said he would not be welcome in the city. Lynette Lederman said she would rely on local political leadership that believes in values, unlike the president, who she accused of not denouncing white nationalism. Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh despite the opposition, as the White House confirmed his visit on Monday. The comments came amid rising antisemitic attacks in the US, with the Anti-Defamation League reporting a sharp increase in incidents of antisemitic harassment and violence. Local Jewish leaders also published an open letter calling for Trump to avoid Pittsburgh, stating that he is not welcome until he fully denounces white nationalism. The shooting, which injured six others, has been labeled as the most deadly attack against Jewish people in America. The suspect, who had no previous criminal record, is accused of tearing through the building with an assault rifle and handguns, shouting antisemitic slurs and posting antisemitic rants on social media. The rabbi of the synagogue, Jeffrey Myers, said he would welcome the president to Pittsburgh, adding that hate exists in all people regardless of their background. Fundraising efforts have driven financial support to the grieving community, with various campaigns raising hundreds of thousands of dollars.
