Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article talks about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, where 11 people were killed. Lynette Lederman, a former synagogue president, criticizes Trump, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech" and says he's not welcome in Pittsburgh. There's a coalition of Jewish leaders who also want Trump to avoid the city until he denounces white nationalism. Trump is planning to visit, though, and he's been using Twitter to attack the media as the "Enemy of the People," which adds to the polarizing rhetoric.

The shooting is described as an antisemitic attack, and the suspect, Robert Bowers, is charged with murdering people exercising their religious beliefs. The ADL notes an increase in antisemitic incidents, blaming it on rhetoric from public figures. Meanwhile, some leaders, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcome Trump, saying hate isn't a political issue. There's also fundraising efforts to support the community.

I need to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Words like "purveyor," "hate," "denounce," "antisemitic," "attack," "rhetoric," "enemy," "fraudulent," "hostility," "accurately," "fairly," "murdering," "massacre," "deadly," "attacks," "rise," "incidents," "harassment," "violence," "antisemitism," "repeat," "supremacists," "killed," "safety," "solidarity," "efforts," "support," "campaign," "fundraiser," "services," "tearing," "rants," "injured."

I'll structure the summary to cover Lederman's criticism, the coalition's stance, Trump's visit and media comments, the attack details, the ADL's report, Myers' welcoming of Trump, and the community support efforts. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include as many moral terms as possible without making it too verbose.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral language.
