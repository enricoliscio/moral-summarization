Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of certain words. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should include in the summary. My task is to create a concise summary (no more than 200 words) that includes as many of these words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the aftermath, and the reactions from various leaders, including the president. Key points include:

1. Lynette Lederman's statement about not wanting Trump to visit Pittsburgh, calling him a "purveyor of hate speech."
2. The open letter from local Jewish leaders urging Trump to avoid the city until he denounces white nationalism.
3. Trump's response, including his criticism of the media as the "Enemy of the People."
4. The details of the shooting, the victims, and the suspect's background.
5. Reactions from other leaders, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcoming Trump.
6. Fundraising efforts to support the community.

Now, I need to structure this into a summary, using the morally framed words provided. I should make sure to include words like "purveyor," "hate speech," "denounce," "white nationalism," "antisemitic," "massacre," "attacks," etc.

I'll start by mentioning the shooting and the victims. Then, I'll address Lederman's statement and the open letter. Next, I'll include Trump's response and his criticism of the media. Then, I'll touch on the suspect's background and the fundraising efforts. Finally, I'll mention Myers' differing opinion.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral framing words. I'll make sure to use the words in context to maintain the author's perspective.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include the necessary terms and keep it within the word limit. I'll check the word count to make sure it's not too long.

SUMMARY:  
The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, where 11 were murdered, has sparked moral and political tensions. Lynette Lederman, a former synagogue president, called President Trump a "purveyor of hate speech" and urged him not to visit Pittsburgh, emphasizing his failure to denounce white nationalism. A coalition of Jewish leaders echoed this, stating Trump is unwelcome until he renounces such ideologies. Trump, however, labeled the attack an "antisemitic" act and criticized the media as the "Enemy of the People," accusing them of inaccurate and fraudulent reporting. The suspect, Robert Bowers, allegedly shouted antisemitic slurs during the massacre, which the Anti-Defamation League called the deadliest attack against Jews in America. While some leaders, like Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, welcomed Trump, others focused on solidarity and fundraising efforts to support the grieving community. The attack highlights a rise in antisemitic incidents and the broader societal struggle against hate. END OF SUMMARY.
