SUMMARY:
An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play in the NFL again. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, and then reversed itself after public outcry. However, it turns out they were well-informed all along and just didn't think pummeling a woman was worthy of serious punishment. The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence. They claimed Rice misled them, but the arbitrator recognized it as bullshit. The NFL's arguments suggest they still don't understand domestic assault, or take it seriously enough. The fact that they made such arguments suggests willful blindness to the assault, and a callous disregard for its seriousness. The NFL still has a lot to learn when it comes to domestic violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
