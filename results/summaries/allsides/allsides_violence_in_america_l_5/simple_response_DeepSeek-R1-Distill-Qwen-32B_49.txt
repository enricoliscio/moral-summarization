Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the ethical issues presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Ray Rice's appeal of his NFL suspension being granted. The arbitrator's decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The key points are:

1. Ray Rice was suspended initially for two games after assaulting his girlfriend, but later the suspension was made indefinite after more evidence came out.
2. The arbitrator found that the NFL knew about the severity of the assault from the start but didn't take it seriously, leading to a lighter punishment.
3. The NFL's defense that Rice misled them was dismissed because they had access to evidence but chose not to view it, showing a disregard for the seriousness of domestic violence.
4. The article criticizes the NFL's approach to domestic violence, suggesting they don't understand or take it seriously enough.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral critique intact. I'll focus on the NFL's failure to address domestic violence properly, the arbitrator's findings, and the implications for future cases.

I should structure the summary to highlight the NFL's initial leniency, the arbitrator's decision, the NFL's flawed defense, and the ongoing concerns about their handling of such issues. I'll make sure to include the moral implications, like the league's lack of understanding and the potential for similar issues in the future.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and captures all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, ruling that the league's initial two-game punishment for his 2014 assault on his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, was sufficient. The decision criticized the NFL for not taking the assault seriously at the time, as they were aware of its severity but chose not to impose harsher penalties. The league's defense that Rice misled them about the incident was dismissed, as they had access to evidence but failed to review it. The arbitrator found that the NFL's failure to act decisively reflects a broader issue with how the league understands and addresses domestic violence. The case raises concerns about the NFL's willingness to properly handle future cases of domestic violence, highlighting a systemic failure to prioritize accountability and seriousness in such matters. END OF SUMMARY.
