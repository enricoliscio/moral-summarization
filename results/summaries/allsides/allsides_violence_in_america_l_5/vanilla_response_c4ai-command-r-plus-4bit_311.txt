SUMMARY: An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL, allowing him to play again. The decision reveals that the NFL's initial leniency toward Rice was not due to misinformation, but rather a failure to take domestic violence seriously. The NFL claimed Rice had misled them about the severity of the assault, but the arbitrator found they had access to all the evidence and chose to rely on Rice's description. This suggests a willful blindness and disregard for the issue of domestic violence. The NFL's arguments and Commissioner Goodell's expectations during arbitration indicate a persistent lack of understanding and concern regarding domestic violence. The league's handling of the situation raises concerns about their ability to address future incidents appropriately. The arbitrator's decision highlights the need for the NFL to improve its response to domestic violence. 

END OF SUMMARY.
