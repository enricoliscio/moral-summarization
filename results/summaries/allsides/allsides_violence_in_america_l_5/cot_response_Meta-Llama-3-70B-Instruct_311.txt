SUMMARY:
The NFL's handling of Ray Rice's domestic violence case has been deemed a "damning indictment" by an arbitrator. Initially, the league gave Rice a light punishment, suspending him for only two games, despite knowing the severity of the assault. When a new video emerged, the NFL revised the punishment to an indefinite suspension, claiming Rice had misled them about the incident. However, the arbitrator found that the NFL was fully aware of the facts and had access to the second video, but chose not to watch it, demonstrating "willful blindness" and a "callous disregard" for the seriousness of the assault. The NFL's defense arguments, which downplayed the severity of the assault, cast "serious doubt" on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence. The league's approach raises questions about how they will handle future cases of domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
