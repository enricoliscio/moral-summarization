Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Ray Rice and the NFL's handling of his domestic violence case. They provided the article, and they specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The main event is that an arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play again. This decision criticized the NFL's approach to domestic violence. 

The article details the incident where Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend in 2014, with two videos capturing the event. The NFL initially suspended him for two games but later made it indefinite after more information came out. Rice appealed, arguing that the NFL's punishment was unfair because they already knew the severity of the incident. The arbitrator agreed, pointing out that the NFL didn't take the assault seriously initially and that their arguments during arbitration showed they still didn't understand domestic violence issues.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: the arbitrator's decision, the initial and revised punishments, the details of the assault, the NFL's handling, and the implications for their approach to domestic violence. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and factual without any bias.

I should structure the summary to first state the outcome of the appeal, then the details of the incident, the NFL's initial and revised actions, the arbitrator's findings, and the concerns raised about the NFL's understanding of domestic violence. I'll need to avoid jargon and keep the language straightforward.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I need to make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown, just plain text.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I'll put it together in a concise manner, making sure each sentence adds value and doesn't exceed the word limit.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, citing the league's mishandling of domestic violence cases. Rice, who assaulted his then-girlfriend Janay Palmer in 2014, was initially suspended for two games but faced harsher punishment after additional footage emerged. The arbitrator ruled that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had prior knowledge of the incident's severity and thus couldn't impose a second punishment. The decision highlights the NFL's failure to take the assault seriously initially and its inability to address domestic violence effectively. The league's arguments during arbitration, including claims that Rice misled them about the incident, were deemed flawed, as the NFL had access to evidence but chose not to review it. This raises concerns about the NFL's approach to future domestic violence cases, suggesting a lack of understanding and seriousness in addressing such issues. END OF SUMMARY.
