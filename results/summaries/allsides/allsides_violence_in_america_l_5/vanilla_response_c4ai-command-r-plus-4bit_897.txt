SUMMARY: An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL, allowing him to play again. The decision reveals a concerning lack of understanding and response to domestic violence by the NFL. Initially, the NFL gave Rice a light punishment, claiming they were misled by Rice's account of the incident, but the arbitrator found that the NFL was fully informed and chose not to take the assault seriously. The NFL's defense arguments suggest they don't understand the severity of domestic assault and continue to minimize and disregard such incidents. The arbitrator found that the NFL had access to the elevator video but chose not to watch it, indicating willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of the assault. The NFL's failure to properly address domestic violence raises concerns about their ability to handle future incidents. The decision highlights the need for the NFL to improve its response to domestic violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
