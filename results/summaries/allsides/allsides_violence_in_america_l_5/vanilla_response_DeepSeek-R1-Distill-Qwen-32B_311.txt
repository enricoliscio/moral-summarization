Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Ray Rice and the NFL's handling of his case. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by saying that an arbitrator granted Ray Rice's appeal, making him eligible to play again. The arbitrator's decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The NFL initially gave him a light punishment, then changed it after public outcry. But the arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the severity all along but didn't take it seriously.

Ray Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator. There were two videos: one inside the elevator and another from the hallway. The NFL initially suspended him for two games but later made it indefinite after the second video went public. Rice appealed, arguing the NFL abused their discretion by changing the punishment.

The arbitrator ruled that the NFL knew the facts when they imposed the initial suspension, so they couldn't change it later. The article criticizes the NFL for not taking the assault seriously and for their flawed arguments during arbitration, like claiming Rice misled them. The NFL also didn't watch the second video, relying on Rice's description instead. This shows a disregard for the seriousness of domestic violence.

The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should include the arbitrator's decision, the NFL's initial and revised punishments, the incident details, the videos, and the criticism of the NFL's approach to domestic violence.

Let me structure this: start with the arbitrator's decision, mention the initial and revised suspensions, describe the assault, the videos, the NFL's arguments, their failure to watch the second video, and the implications on their handling of domestic violence.

I need to make sure it's clear and concise, hitting all the key points without going into too much detail. Also, avoid any markdown and keep it natural.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to return to the NFL. The decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence, revealing they knew about the severity of Rice's assault on his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, but initially punished him lightly. Rice hit Palmer so hard she was knocked unconscious, and the incident was captured on two videos. The NFL suspended him for two games initially but revised it to indefinite after the second video surfaced. Rice appealed, arguing the NFL abused their discretion. The arbitrator found the NFL knew the facts but didn't take the assault seriously, and their arguments during arbitration showed a lack of understanding of domestic violence. The NFL claimed Rice misled them but had access to the second video and chose not to watch it, indicating willful blindness. This raises concerns about the NFL's approach to future domestic violence cases. END OF SUMMARY.
