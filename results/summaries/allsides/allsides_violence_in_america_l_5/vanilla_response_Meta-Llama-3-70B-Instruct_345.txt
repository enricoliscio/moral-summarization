SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned the NFL's indefinite suspension of Ray Rice, making him eligible to play again. The decision is a criticism of the NFL's handling of domestic violence cases. Rice was initially suspended for two games after assaulting his then-girlfriend in an elevator, but the suspension was increased to indefinite after a video of the incident was released. The arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the facts of the case from the beginning and should not have increased the suspension. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to understand and respond to domestic violence, as the league's defense arguments suggested that they did not take the assault seriously enough. The NFL's claims that Rice misled them about the nature of the assault were rejected, and the arbitrator found that the league had access to all the evidence but chose not to review it. The decision raises questions about how the NFL will handle future domestic violence cases.

END OF SUMMARY.
