SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play in the NFL again. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially went easy on Rice, then reversed itself after a public outcry, claiming he had misled them. However, it turns out they were well-informed all along and simply didn't think pummeling a woman was worthy of serious punishment. Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend Janay Palmer, knocking her unconscious, and the NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence. The NFL claimed Rice misled them, but the arbitrator recognized it as bullshit. The league's arguments suggest they still don't take domestic assault seriously, and their failure to watch available evidence shows willful blindness and a callous disregard for its seriousness. The decision raises questions about the NFL's approach to domestic violence and whether they will learn from their mistakes.

END OF SUMMARY.
