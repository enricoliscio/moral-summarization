SUMMARY: An arbitrator's decision to grant Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension from the NFL is a damning indictment of the league's handling of domestic violence. The arbitrator found that the NFL was fully informed about the gravity of Rice's crime—pummeling his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator—but initially went easy on him with a light punishment. Despite public outcry and the release of a second video, the NFL's arguments during the arbitration process suggest they still don't take domestic assault seriously. The NFL claimed Rice misled them by downplaying the assault, but the arbitrator found that they had access to all the evidence and chose to rely on Rice's description, demonstrating willful blindness and a callous disregard for the seriousness of the offense. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to understand and respond to domestic violence, and questions remain about how they will handle similar incidents in the future. It is unfortunate that Rice received only a light punishment, but the arbitration decision exposes the NFL's troubling attitudes and approaches to domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
