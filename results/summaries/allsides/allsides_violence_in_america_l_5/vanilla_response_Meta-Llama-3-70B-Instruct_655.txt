SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL, making him eligible to play again. The decision criticizes the NFL's handling of domestic violence, revealing that the league initially went easy on Rice and only increased his punishment after public outcry. The arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the severity of the assault, in which Rice knocked his then-girlfriend unconscious in an elevator, but chose not to take it seriously. The NFL's defense arguments, which claimed Rice misled them about the incident, are dismissed as "bullshit" by the arbitrator. The league's failure to watch available video evidence and its reliance on Rice's description of the events suggest a willful blindness to the assault. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to understand and respond to domestic violence, and questions whether the league will take future incidents seriously.
