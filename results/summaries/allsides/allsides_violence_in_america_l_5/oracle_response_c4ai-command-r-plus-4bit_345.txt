SUMMARY: An arbitrator ruled that Ray Rice is eligible to play in the NFL again, issuing a damning indictment of the league's handling of domestic violence. The NFL initially gave Rice a light punishment, claiming he misled them about the nature of the assault, but the arbitrator found that the NFL was fully informed and chose to disregard the seriousness of the incident. Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend, now wife, Janay Rice, in an elevator, knocking her unconscious and attempting to drag her out. The NFL's defense arguments cast doubt on their understanding of and response to domestic violence, minimizing the severity of the assault. The arbitrator's decision reveals the NFL's willful blindness and callous disregard for domestic violence, raising concerns about their ability to handle future incidents appropriately. The NFL's initial leniency and subsequent attempts to revise Rice's punishment indicate a lack of understanding of the gravity of the crime. The NFL's claim that Rice's description of the assault as a "slap" rather than a "hit" influenced their decision-making is absurd and demonstrates a continued failure to take domestic violence seriously. This case highlights the NFL's troubling approach to domestic violence and raises questions about their commitment to addressing it effectively.
END OF SUMMARY.
