Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension from the NFL. An arbitrator granted his appeal, making him eligible to play again. The author is critical of the NFL's handling of domestic violence cases, especially in this instance.

The main points are:
- Ray Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in 2014. She was knocked unconscious in an elevator, and there were two videos capturing the incident.
- The NFL initially suspended him for two games and fined him, but later, after more videos came out, they suspended him indefinitely.
- Rice appealed, arguing that the NFL's commissioner abused his discretion by revising the punishment. The arbitrator agreed, saying the NFL knew the severity all along but didn't take it seriously.
- The article criticizes the NFL for not taking domestic violence seriously, pointing out that they relied on Rice's misleading statements and didn't watch the second video even though they had access to it.
- The moral issue is that the NFL's handling shows a lack of understanding and seriousness towards domestic violence, which is concerning for future cases.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points and the moral critique. It should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by mentioning the arbitrator's decision, then the context of the assault and the NFL's initial and revised punishments. Highlight the arbitrator's finding that the NFL didn't take the assault seriously. Then discuss the NFL's arguments and the arbitrator's rejection of them, pointing out the league's lack of understanding and callousness. Conclude with the concern about future cases.

Let me structure this into a coherent summary, making sure to include all key points and the moral framing.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, reigniting criticism of the league's handling of domestic violence. Rice, who assaulted his then-girlfriend in 2014, initially received a light punishment but was later suspended indefinitely after additional footage emerged. The arbitrator ruled that the NFL knew the severity of the assault from the start but didn't take it seriously, leading to a lenient initial penalty. The NFL's defense, claiming Rice misled them about the incident, was dismissed as the arbitrator noted they had access to evidence but chose not to view it. This highlights the league's failure to understand or address domestic violence seriously, raising concerns about future cases. END OF SUMMARY.
