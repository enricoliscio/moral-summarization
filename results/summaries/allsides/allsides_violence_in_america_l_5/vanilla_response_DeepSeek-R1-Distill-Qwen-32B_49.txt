Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Ray Rice and the NFL's handling of his case. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how an arbitrator granted Ray Rice's appeal, allowing him to play in the NFL again. It criticizes the NFL for how they handled the domestic violence case. Initially, Rice was suspended for two games and fined, but after more evidence came out, they suspended him indefinitely. The arbitrator ruled that the NFL's initial decision was based on the information they had at the time, so they couldn't change the punishment later.

Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator. There were two videos: one inside the elevator and one from the hallway. The NFL knew about the second video but didn't watch it, relying instead on Rice's description. The article argues that the NFL didn't take the assault seriously initially and that their defense during arbitration showed they still don't understand domestic violence.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the key points: the arbitrator's decision, the initial and revised punishments, the videos, the NFL's handling, and the criticism about their approach to domestic violence.

I should structure it to first mention the arbitrator's decision, then the context of the assault, the NFL's initial and revised actions, the arbitrator's findings, and the criticism of the NFL's approach. I need to keep it concise and clear, avoiding too much detail but covering all the main elements.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to return to the NFL. The NFL initially suspended him for two games in 2014 after he assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator, knocking her unconscious. The league revised the punishment to indefinite after additional video evidence emerged. The arbitrator ruled the NFL could not impose a harsher penalty after the initial suspension, as they were aware of the severity from the start. The NFL's defense, claiming Rice misled them, was criticized for downplaying domestic violence. The league had access to a second video but didn't review it, suggesting a lack of seriousness toward the incident. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's handling of future domestic violence cases. END OF SUMMARY.
