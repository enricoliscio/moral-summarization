Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing the author gave. The user mentioned that I'm a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to focus on the ethical issues presented.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about Ray Rice getting his NFL suspension overturned by an arbitrator. The NFL initially gave him a light punishment, then changed it after public outcry, but the arbitrator said the NFL knew the severity all along and didn't take it seriously.

The article talks about the incident where Rice assaulted his girlfriend, which was captured on two videos. The NFL's handling is criticized for not taking domestic violence seriously. The key moral points are the NFL's initial leniency, their failure to review evidence, and their attitude towards domestic violence.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the moral issues: the NFL's mishandling, the arbitrator's decision, and the implications for future cases. I should make sure the summary reflects the author's criticism of the NFL's approach to domestic violence.

Let me structure it: start with the arbitrator's decision, mention the incident, NFL's initial punishment, the appeal, the arbitrator's findings, and the critique of the NFL's handling and attitude towards domestic violence.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and concise, ensuring the moral framing is evident. I'll make sure to include that the NFL didn't take the assault seriously, their failure to review evidence, and the implications for future cases.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary, making sure it's under 200 words and captures all the essential moral points.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, allowing him to return to the league. The decision criticized the NFL for mishandling domestic violence, revealing they knew the severity of Rice's assault but didn't take it seriously. Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend in 2014, knocking her unconscious, an incident captured on two videos. The NFL initially suspended him for two games but later imposed an indefinite ban after public outcry. The arbitrator found the NFL knew about the assault's severity and had access to evidence but failed to review it, relying instead on Rice's misleading account. The NFL's defense argued that Rice misled them, but the arbitrator rejected this, highlighting the league's lack of understanding and disregard for domestic violence. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to handle future cases of domestic violence, suggesting a systemic failure to address such issues seriously. END OF SUMMARY.
