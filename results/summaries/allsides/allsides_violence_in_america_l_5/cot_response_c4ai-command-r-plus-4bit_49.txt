SUMMARY:
An arbitrator has ruled that Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL was unjustified, arguing that the league had all the information necessary to make an informed decision about his punishment from the start. The NFL claimed that Rice had misled them about the details of the assault, but the arbitrator found that the league's argument was absurd and revealed a deeper issue: the NFL's failure to comprehend and address domestic violence adequately. The league's defense argued that Rice had only "slapped" his girlfriend, downplaying the severity of the assault, and suggested that she was responsible for knocking herself out on the railing. This "just a slap, NBD" attitude demonstrates a disturbing lack of understanding and a willful blindness towards domestic violence. The arbitrator's decision exposes the NFL's problematic approach to handling such incidents, raising serious concerns about their ability to respond appropriately in the future. The league's initial light punishment and subsequent attempts to revise it show a disregard for the seriousness of domestic assault. This case reveals that the NFL still has much to learn about appropriately addressing domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
