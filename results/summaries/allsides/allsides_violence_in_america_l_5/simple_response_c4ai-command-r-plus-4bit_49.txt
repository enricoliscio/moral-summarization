SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. This decision has brought to light the NFL's problematic handling of domestic violence cases. Despite video evidence of Rice assaulting his then-girlfriend, the NFL initially only suspended him for two games. Only after public outrage and the release of a second video did the NFL revise its punishment. However, the arbitrator's decision reveals that the NFL was well-informed about the assault and chose to impose a lighter punishment, indicating a lack of seriousness in addressing domestic violence. The NFL's defense arguments and Commissioner Roger Goodell's expectations reveal a concerning attitude towards domestic violence, suggesting that the league still has a long way to go in understanding and responding appropriately to such incidents. The arbitrator's decision highlights the NFL's willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of domestic assault, raising questions about their ability to handle future cases effectively. The NFL's approach to this case sets a dangerous precedent and raises doubts about their commitment to addressing domestic violence within the league. 

END OF SUMMARY.
