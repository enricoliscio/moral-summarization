SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. The decision is a scathing critique of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, then increased it after public outcry, but the arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the severity of the assault all along. The NFL's defense arguments reveal a disturbing lack of understanding and response to domestic violence. They claimed Rice misled them about the assault, but the arbitrator saw through this excuse. In reality, the NFL didn't take the assault seriously enough, and their arguments suggest they still don't. The league's management seems to downplay the severity of domestic violence, even suggesting that a "slap" is morally superior to a "hit". The NFL's willful blindness and callous disregard for the seriousness of the assault are worrying, and raise questions about how they will handle future cases of domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
