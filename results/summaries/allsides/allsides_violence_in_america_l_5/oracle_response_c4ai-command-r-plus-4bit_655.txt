SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play in the NFL again. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. While the NFL initially went easy on Rice, suspending him for only two games and fining him for a third, public outcry and the release of a second video of the incident led to an indefinite suspension. Rice's appeal argued that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell abused his discretion by re-punishing him for the same offense. The arbitrator's decision found that Goodell was fully aware of the facts of the assault and that the NFL's claims of being misled by Rice were unfounded. The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence, minimizing the severity of the assault and demonstrating a callous disregard for its seriousness. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to appropriately address domestic violence and suggests a need for significant change in their approach. 

END OF SUMMARY.
