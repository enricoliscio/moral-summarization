SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. The decision is a scathing indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, then increased it after public outcry, but the arbitrator found that they were aware of the severity of the assault all along and didn't think it warranted serious punishment. The NFL's defense arguments reveal a disturbing lack of understanding and seriousness about domestic violence. They claimed Rice misled them about the assault, but the arbitrator rejected this, finding that the NFL didn't take the assault seriously enough. The league's arguments, including the suggestion that it's morally superior to "slap” rather than “hit” a girlfriend, are bizarre and disturbing. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to respond to domestic violence and whether they will take it seriously in the future.
