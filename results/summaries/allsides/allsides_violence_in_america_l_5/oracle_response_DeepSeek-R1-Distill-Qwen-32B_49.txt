Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Ray Rice's appeal of his NFL suspension and the implications for how the NFL handles domestic violence.

I notice the author uses strong moral terms like "damning," "indictment," "pummeling," and "violence." These words are crucial to maintaining the article's critical tone. I should include as many of these as possible without making the summary too long.

The key points are: Rice's assault, the NFL's initial lenient punishment, the arbitrator's decision overturning the indefinite suspension, and the league's failure to take domestic violence seriously. I need to highlight the NFL's insensitivity and the arbitrator's criticism.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the arbitrator's decision, then describe the assault, the NFL's initial response, the appeal, and the broader implications of the league's handling of domestic violence. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to convey the author's stance effectively.

Let me check the word count. I need to keep it under 200 words. I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes all necessary points without being too verbose. Finally, I'll review to ensure all key moral terms are included and the summary accurately reflects the article's critical perspective on the NFL's approach to domestic violence.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, allowing him to return to the league. The decision harshly criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence, revealing the league initially downplayed Rice's assault on his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in 2014. Rice hit Palmer so hard she was knocked unconscious and dragged in an elevator, with video evidence capturing the incident. The NFL initially suspended him for two games but later imposed an indefinite ban after additional footage emerged. However, the arbitrator ruled the NFL abused its discretion, as it had access to the evidence but chose not to view it, relying instead on Rice's misleading account. The NFL's defense, which suggested the assault was "just a slap," was deemed absurd, highlighting the league's failure to take domestic violence seriously. The arbitrator's decision underscores the NFL's callous disregard for the severity of the crime and raises concerns about its ability to address similar incidents in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
