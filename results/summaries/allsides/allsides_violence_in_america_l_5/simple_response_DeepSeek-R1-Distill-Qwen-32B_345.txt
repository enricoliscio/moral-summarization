Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Ray Rice and the NFL's handling of his case. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

First, the article talks about an arbitrator overturning Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play again. The author is critical of the NFL's handling of the case, pointing out that they initially gave a light punishment and then tried to change it after public outcry. The arbitrator's decision shows that the NFL knew about the severity of the assault but didn't take it seriously enough.

The article details the incident where Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator. There were two videos: one inside the elevator and one from the hallway. The NFL initially punished him lightly but then suspended him indefinitely after the second video came out. Rice appealed, arguing that the NFL's punishment was unfair because they already knew the details. The arbitrator agreed, saying the NFL couldn't change the punishment after the fact.

The author is frustrated that the NFL didn't take domestic violence seriously, as shown by their arguments during arbitration. They claimed Rice misled them, but the arbitrator found that the NFL had access to the evidence but chose not to view it, showing a disregard for the seriousness of the assault.

The moral framing here is that the NFL's handling of the case reflects a broader issue with how they understand and respond to domestic violence. The author suggests that the league's approach is callous and that they might not change their ways in the future.

So, for the summary, I need to capture the key events, the arbitrator's decision, the NFL's initial and revised punishments, the moral critique of the NFL's handling, and the underlying issue of domestic violence response. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral perspective is clear.

Let me structure it: Start with the arbitrator's decision, mention the incident, the NFL's initial and revised punishments, the appeal outcome, the NFL's arguments, the arbitrator's findings, and the critique of the NFL's attitude towards domestic violence. Conclude with the implications for future cases.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically and maintains the critical tone towards the NFL's handling of the situation. Also, make sure to include that the arbitrator found the NFL had access to evidence but ignored it, highlighting their lack of seriousness towards the assault.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, allowing him to return to the league. The decision criticized the NFL for mishandling domestic violence, revealing they initially downplayed the severity of Rice's assault on his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in 2014. The NFL initially suspended Rice for two games but later imposed an indefinite ban after additional video evidence surfaced. Rice appealed, arguing the league abused its discretion. The arbitrator ruled the NFL knew the assault's details but didn't take it seriously, leading to the lighter initial punishment. The NFL's defense, claiming Rice misled them, was dismissed as the arbitrator noted they had access to the second video but chose not to view it. This highlights the NFL's failure to understand or prioritize domestic violence, raising concerns about future cases. The league's approach reflects a troubling disregard for the seriousness of such offenses. END OF SUMMARY.
