SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, suspending him for two games, despite knowing the severity of the assault. The arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the facts of the assault, including the elevator video, but chose to downplay its severity. The NFL's defense arguments, which claimed Rice misled them about the nature of the assault, are revealed to be bullshit. The league's failure to take domestic violence seriously is evident in their arguments, which suggest that a "slap" is morally superior to a "hit". The arbitrator's decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to understand and respond to domestic violence, and whether they will take future incidents seriously. The league's willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of the assault are alarming. END OF SUMMARY.
