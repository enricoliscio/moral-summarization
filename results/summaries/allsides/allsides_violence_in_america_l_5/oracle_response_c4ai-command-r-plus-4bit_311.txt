SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. This decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. Despite initially going easy on Rice with a two-game suspension and a fine, the NFL reversed its decision after public outcry and additional video evidence emerged. However, the arbitrator's decision reveals that the NFL was well-informed about the severity of Rice's assault on his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, and their initial leniency was due to a lack of seriousness regarding domestic violence. The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their understanding and response to domestic violence, with their claims that Rice misled them being recognized as bullshit. The arbitrator found that the NFL knew about and had access to the additional video evidence but chose to rely on Rice's description of the events, demonstrating willful blindness and disregard for the gravity of the crime. This raises concerns about the NFL's ability to appropriately address domestic violence incidents in the future. 

END OF SUMMARY.
