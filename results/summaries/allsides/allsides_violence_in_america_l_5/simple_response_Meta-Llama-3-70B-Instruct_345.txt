SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. The decision is a scathing critique of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, then increased it after public outcry, claiming he had misled them about the assault. However, the arbitrator found that the NFL was well-aware of the facts and simply didn't think domestic violence was worthy of serious punishment. The NFL's defense arguments reveal a disturbing lack of understanding and response to domestic violence. They claimed Rice misled them by downplaying the assault, but the arbitrator saw through this excuse. The NFL's failure to take domestic violence seriously is evident in their arguments, which suggest that they still don't understand the gravity of the crime. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to respond to domestic violence in the future.

END OF SUMMARY.
