SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned the NFL's indefinite suspension of Ray Rice, allowing him to play again. The decision is a scathing critique of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially suspended Rice for only two games after he brutally assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator. After public outcry, the NFL increased the suspension, but the arbitrator ruled that the league was aware of the severity of the assault all along and chose not to take it seriously. The NFL's defense arguments, which downplayed the violence and blamed the victim, reveal a disturbing lack of understanding and concern for domestic violence. The league's failure to review all available evidence and its willingness to minimize the seriousness of the assault raise questions about its ability to respond to domestic violence. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's culture and priorities.
