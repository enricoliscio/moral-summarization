SUMMARY: 
Yesterday, an arbitrator ruled that Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL was unjustified, allowing him to play again. This decision reveals the NFL's problematic handling of domestic violence cases and their failure to comprehend their severity. 

Previously, Rice had received a light punishment of a two-game suspension and a fine for assaulting his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an Atlantic City casino elevator. However, after a second video of the assault surfaced, the NFL attempted to revise their punishment, claiming Rice had misled them about the nature of the assault. 

The arbitrator's decision highlights the NFL's initial failure to take the assault seriously and their continued disregard for domestic violence. The NFL's defense arguments, which attempted to minimize the severity of Rice's actions and shift blame onto Palmer, were deemed absurd and indicative of their lack of understanding of domestic assault. 

Furthermore, the NFL's failure to review all available evidence, including the second video, demonstrates a willful blindness and callous disregard for the seriousness of the assault. The arbitrator's decision raises serious concerns about the NFL's ability to handle domestic violence cases appropriately and their willingness to address these issues. 

END OF SUMMARY.
