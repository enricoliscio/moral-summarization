SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL, making him eligible to play again. The decision is a scathing critique of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. Rice was initially suspended for two games after assaulting his then-girlfriend Janay Palmer in an elevator, but the suspension was increased to indefinite after a video of the incident was released. The arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the severity of the incident from the start and had no right to increase the suspension. The NFL's defense arguments, which claimed Rice misled them about the nature of the assault, were rejected. The arbitrator's decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to understand and respond to domestic violence, suggesting that the league still does not take the issue seriously enough. The NFL's arguments and actions in the case demonstrate a lack of understanding of domestic assault and a callous disregard for its seriousness.

END OF SUMMARY.
