SUMMARY: An arbitrator granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension from the NFL, finding that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had abused his discretion. Rice, a former player for the Baltimore Ravens, had initially been suspended for two games and fined for assaulting his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator in 2014. The NFL revised the punishment to an indefinite suspension after a second video of the assault was released to the public. Rice argued that Goodell was fully aware of the facts of the assault and therefore the second, more severe punishment was not warranted. The arbitrator agreed, stating that the NFL's initial light punishment indicated a lack of understanding and seriousness about domestic violence. The NFL's defense arguments, which attempted to justify their actions, further revealed their mismanagement of such cases. The arbitrator's decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to handle domestic violence incidents effectively and appropriately. The NFL's claim that Rice misled them about the nature of the assault was refuted, and their failure to review all available evidence suggested willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of the incident. The case highlights the need for the NFL to improve its response to domestic violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
