Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about Ray Rice's appeal of his NFL suspension. The arbitrator ruled in his favor, making him eligible to play again. The author is critical of the NFL's handling of domestic violence cases, especially in this instance. 

The key points are:
- Ray Rice assaulted his girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator, knocking her unconscious.
- The NFL initially gave him a light punishment but later suspended him indefinitely after more information came out.
- Rice appealed, arguing the NFL shouldn't punish him twice for the same offense.
- The arbitrator agreed, saying the NFL knew the severity from the start but didn't take it seriously.
- The article criticizes the NFL's approach to domestic violence, suggesting they don't understand its seriousness.

I need to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Words like "damning," "indictment," "violence," "pummeling," "assault," "slap," "abuse," etc., should be included.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the arbitrator's decision, then the context of the assault, the NFL's initial and revised punishments, the appeal, and the critique of the NFL's handling. I'll make sure to highlight the moral issues, like the NFL's轻率处理和对家庭暴力的忽视。

Let me draft it step by step, making sure it's concise and under 200 words. I'll also ensure that the moral framing is clear, using the specified words to convey the criticism of the NFL's actions.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator ruled in favor of Ray Rice, overturning his indefinite NFL suspension, allowing him to return to the league. The decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence, highlighting its initial leniency toward Rice. In 2014, Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, knocking her unconscious in an elevator. The NFL initially suspended him for two games but revised to indefinite after additional video emerged. Rice appealed, arguing against double punishment. The arbitrator found the NFL knew the severity from the start but didn't take it seriously, questioning their understanding of domestic violence. The NFL's defense, claiming Rice misled them, was dismissed as "bullshit," with evidence showing they ignored available footage. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's approach to such incidents, suggesting a lack of seriousness and potential for similar future mishandling. END OF SUMMARY.
