SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension from the NFL, finding that the league was fully aware of the facts of his assault on his then-girlfriend and now-wife, Janay Rice. The decision reveals a troubling pattern within the NFL's management regarding their understanding and response to domestic violence. The NFL's defense argued that Rice had misled them about the nature of the assault, but the arbitrator recognized that the league's initial light punishment indicated a lack of seriousness in addressing domestic violence. The NFL's arguments during the arbitration further demonstrated their failure to understand the severity of domestic assault. The league's claim that Rice's description of the incident as a "slap" was somehow less morally reprehensible than a "hit" is absurd, especially considering the victim was knocked unconscious. The NFL also failed to review all available evidence, suggesting a willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of the assault. The arbitrator's decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to appropriately handle future cases of domestic violence involving its players. This incident highlights the need for the NFL to improve its understanding and response to domestic violence. 

END OF SUMMARY.
