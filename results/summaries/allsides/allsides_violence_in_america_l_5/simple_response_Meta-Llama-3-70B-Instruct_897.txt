SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. However, the decision is a scathing indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, then increased it after public outcry, but the arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the severity of the assault all along and simply didn't think it was worthy of serious punishment. The NFL's defense arguments reveal a disturbing lack of understanding and response to domestic violence, with the league claiming that Rice misled them about the nature of the assault and downplaying the severity of the crime. The arbitrator rejected these arguments, highlighting the NFL's willful blindness to the assault and callous disregard for its seriousness. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to respond to domestic violence in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
