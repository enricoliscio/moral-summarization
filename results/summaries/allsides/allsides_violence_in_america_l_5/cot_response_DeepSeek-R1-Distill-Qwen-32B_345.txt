Alright, I need to tackle this query. The user has provided a detailed news article about Ray Rice's case and the NFL's handling of domestic violence. They want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I should understand the task. They mentioned two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary. The user is clear about the structure, so I need to follow that precisely.

Looking at the article, I notice several emotionally charged words. Words like "damning," "indictment," "abuse," "pummeling," "unconscious," "drag," "ignored," "abused," "abused," "abuse," "callous," "indifference," "contempt," "disregard," "ignorance," "negligence," "failure," and "culpability." These words carry strong moral implications, so I should list them in step one.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these moral terms. The key points are the arbitrator's decision, the NFL's initial leniency, the video evidence, the league's mishandling, and the broader implications for how the NFL addresses domestic violence.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the identified moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to highlight the NFL's failure and the arbitrator's ruling, emphasizing the moral shortcomings.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and clearly conveys the main issues: the NFL's initial light punishment, their subsequent change after public pressure, the arbitrator's ruling based on the league's prior knowledge, and the underlying attitudes towards domestic violence within the NFL.

Finally, I'll review to ensure all steps are followed correctly and that the summary accurately reflects the moral framing of the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
An arbitrator ruled in favor of Ray Rice, overturning his indefinite NFL suspension, reigniting concerns about the league's handling of domestic violence. Rice, who assaulted his then-girlfriend Janay Palmer in 2014, initially received a light punishment of two games, despite video evidence showing him knocking her unconscious. The NFL later imposed an indefinite suspension after additional footage emerged, but the arbitrator found the league had prior knowledge of the severity of the assault and failed to act accordingly. The NFL's defense, which claimed Rice misled them about the incident, was dismissed as the arbitrator noted the league had access to the second video but chose not to view it. This decision highlights the NFL's callous disregard for domestic violence, as their handling of the case reflects a troubling indifference to the seriousness of such crimes. The league's failure to properly address Rice's actions raises questions about their ability to handle future cases of domestic abuse. END OF SUMMARY.
