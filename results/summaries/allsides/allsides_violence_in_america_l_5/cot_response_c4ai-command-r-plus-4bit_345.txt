SUMMARY: An arbitrator has ruled that Ray Rice is eligible to play in the NFL again, overturning his indefinite suspension. The decision reveals a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence cases. Initially, the league went easy on Rice, suspending him for only two games and fining him for a third. This light punishment was due to the NFL's failure to take the assault seriously. Despite claiming that Rice misled them about the nature of the assault, the arbitrator found that the NFL had access to all the evidence and chose to rely on Rice's description, demonstrating willful blindness and a callous disregard for the seriousness of domestic violence. The league's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their understanding of and response to such incidents. The NFL's attitude, as exemplified by Commissioner Roger Goodell's acceptance of the "just a slap" argument, suggests a continued lack of understanding and minimization of the issue. This case raises concerns about the NFL's ability to appropriately address domestic violence, with worries that they will continue to ignore evidence, minimize testimony, and hope the issue disappears. This decision and the NFL's response highlight the league's need to improve its handling of domestic violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
