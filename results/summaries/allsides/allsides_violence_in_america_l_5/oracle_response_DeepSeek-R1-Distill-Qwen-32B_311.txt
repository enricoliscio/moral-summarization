Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about Ray Rice's appeal being granted, which makes him eligible to play again. The arbitrator's decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence. Initially, the NFL gave a light punishment, but after public outcry, they suspended him indefinitely. The arbitrator found that the NFL knew about the severity but didn't take it seriously, hence the initial light punishment.

The incident involved Rice assaulting his girlfriend, causing her unconsciousness. The NFL's arguments during arbitration were flawed, as they claimed Rice misled them, but they had access to evidence but didn't review it. The article criticizes the NFL's attitude towards domestic violence, suggesting they don't take it seriously enough.

I need to make sure to include words like "damning," "indictment," "pummeling," "violence," etc. The summary should highlight the NFL's failure to address domestic violence adequately and the implications for future cases.

I should structure the summary to first mention the arbitrator's decision, then the incident details, the NFL's initial and revised punishments, the arbitration findings, and the critique of the NFL's approach. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral tone is preserved.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to return to the NFL, in a decision that harshly criticized the league's handling of domestic violence. The NFL initially punished Rice lightly for assaulting his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in 2014, but later suspended him indefinitely after the severity of the assault became public. The arbitrator found that the NFL knew about the incident's gravity but chose not to impose stricter punishment initially, revealing their dismissive attitude toward domestic violence. The NFL argued that Rice misled them about the assault, claiming it was a "slap" rather than a violent attack. However, the arbitrator rejected this, noting that the NFL had access to evidence but chose not to review it, showing willful blindness and a disregard for the seriousness of the crime. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to address domestic violence effectively in the future, as their arguments during arbitration demonstrated a troubling lack of understanding and seriousness. END OF SUMMARY.
