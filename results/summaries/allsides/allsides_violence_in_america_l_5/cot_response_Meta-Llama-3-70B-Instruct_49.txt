SUMMARY:
The NFL's handling of Ray Rice's domestic violence case has been deemed a "damning indictment" by an arbitrator, who granted Rice's appeal and made him eligible to play in the league again. The arbitrator's decision revealed that the NFL was aware of the severity of the assault, but chose to impose a light punishment initially. The league's defense arguments cast "serious doubt" on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence. The NFL claimed Rice misled them about the nature of the assault, but the arbitrator recognized this as "bullshit." The league's arguments suggest they still don't take domestic assault seriously, with a "bizarre" and "absurd" focus on the difference between a "slap" and a "hit." The NFL's failure to watch the elevator video and their reliance on Rice's description of the events demonstrate "callous disregard" and "willful blindness" to the assault. The decision raises questions about the NFL's approach to domestic violence and whether they will learn from their mistakes. END OF SUMMARY.
