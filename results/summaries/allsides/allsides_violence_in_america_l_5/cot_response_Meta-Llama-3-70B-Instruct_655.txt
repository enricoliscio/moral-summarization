SUMMARY:
An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play in the NFL again. The decision is a scathing indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, then increased it after public outcry, claiming he had misled them about the assault. However, the arbitrator found that the NFL was well-informed about the incident all along and simply didn't think pummeling a woman was worthy of serious punishment. The NFL's defense arguments, which included claims that Rice only "slapped" his girlfriend and that she had "knocked herself out" on the railing, are bizarre and absurd. The league's failure to watch available video evidence and its reliance on Rice's description of the events suggest willful blindness to the assault and a callous disregard for its seriousness. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to understand and respond to domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
