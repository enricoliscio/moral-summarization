SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. Initially, the league went easy on Rice, suspending him for only two games. However, after public outcry, they reversed their decision, claiming Rice had misled them about the severity of the assault. The arbitrator found that the NFL was well-informed about the incident all along, but didn't think pummeling a woman was worthy of serious punishment. The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence. They claimed Rice misled them by downplaying the assault, but the arbitrator recognized this as bullshit. The NFL's failure to take the assault seriously is a severe concern, and their arguments suggest they still don't understand domestic violence. The league's willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of the assault are alarming, raising questions about their approach to domestic violence in the future.

END OF SUMMARY.
