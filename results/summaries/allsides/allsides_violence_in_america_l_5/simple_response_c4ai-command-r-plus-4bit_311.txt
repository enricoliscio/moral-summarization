SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. This decision has brought to light the NFL's inadequate handling of domestic violence cases and their failure to take such incidents seriously. Rice, a player for the Baltimore Ravens, assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator in 2014. The NFL initially imposed a light punishment of a two-game suspension and a fine for a third game. Despite having access to video evidence, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell chose to rely on Rice's description of the events, demonstrating willful blindness and a disregard for the seriousness of domestic violence. The arbitrator's decision revealed that the NFL's arguments were misleading and that their understanding of domestic assault is severely lacking. The NFL's defense argued that Rice had only "slapped" his girlfriend, downplaying the severity of the assault, and suggested that Palmer was responsible for her own injuries, which is absurd and ridiculous. This incident raises concerns about the NFL's ability to handle domestic violence cases appropriately and their willingness to address the issue with the seriousness it deserves. It is clear that the NFL still has a long way to go in understanding and responding to domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
