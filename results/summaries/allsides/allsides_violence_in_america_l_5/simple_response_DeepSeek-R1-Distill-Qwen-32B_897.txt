Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about Ray Rice's appeal being granted, allowing him to return to the NFL. The arbitrator's decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence. Initially, Rice was suspended for two games but later indefinitely after more details emerged. The author is critical of the NFL's initial leniency and their argument that Rice misled them, which the arbitrator dismissed. The NFL's failure to watch the second video despite having access to it is highlighted as a sign of their insensitivity towards domestic violence.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main events, the arbitrator's decision, the NFL's handling, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to include the key details about Rice's assault, the videos, the initial suspension, the appeal, and the criticism of the NFL's approach to domestic violence.

I should structure it to first state the outcome of the appeal, then the context of the incident, the NFL's initial response, the appeal process, the arbitrator's findings, and the broader implications on the NFL's attitude towards domestic violence. I'll keep the language clear and concise, ensuring the moral criticism is evident.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it adds necessary information without redundancy.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, allowing him to return to the league. The decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence, revealing that the league initially downplayed Rice's assault on his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in 2014. Rice knocked her unconscious in an elevator, and while the NFL initially suspended him for two games, they later imposed an indefinite ban after additional footage emerged. The arbitrator found that the NFL had access to the second video but chose not to view it, relying instead on Rice's misleading account. The league's defense argued that Rice's initial punishment was light because they were unaware of the severity, but the arbitrator dismissed this, noting the NFL's failure to investigate fully. The decision highlights the NFL's insensitivity to domestic violence, raising concerns about their ability to address such incidents seriously in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
