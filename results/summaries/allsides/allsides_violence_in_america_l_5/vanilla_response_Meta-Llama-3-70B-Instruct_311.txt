SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned the indefinite suspension of NFL player Ray Rice, who was punished for assaulting his then-girlfriend in an elevator in 2014. The decision is a scathing critique of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially suspended Rice for two games, but increased the punishment to indefinite after a video of the assault was made public. The arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the facts of the assault from the start and should not have increased the punishment. The NFL's defense arguments, which claimed Rice misled them about the nature of the assault, have been dismissed as "bullshit" by the arbitrator. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to understand and respond to domestic violence, as the league's arguments suggest they still do not take the issue seriously enough. The NFL's failure to review all available evidence and their willingness to minimize the seriousness of the assault are particularly worrying.

END OF SUMMARY.
