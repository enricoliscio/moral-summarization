SUMMARY:
An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play in the NFL again. However, the decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, suspending him for two games, despite knowing the severity of the assault. The arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the facts of the assault, including the elevator video, but chose to ignore it. The NFL's defense arguments, which claimed Rice misled them about the nature of the assault, are bullshit and suggest that the league still doesn't take domestic violence seriously. The NFL's approach to domestic violence is callous, willful, and absurd, and raises questions about how they will handle similar cases in the future. The decision is unfortunate and suggests that the NFL still has a lot to learn about domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
