SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. This decision reveals a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. Initially, the NFL went easy on Rice with a two-game suspension and a fine, but after public outcry and the release of a second video, the NFL reversed its decision and suspended Rice indefinitely. The arbitrator's decision highlights the NFL's failure to take domestic violence seriously and their attempt to justify a light punishment. The NFL's defense arguments cast doubt on their understanding and response to domestic violence, suggesting they still don't grasp the severity of such assaults. The arbitrator found that the NFL knew about and had access to the second video but chose not to watch it, demonstrating willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of the assault. This incident raises concerns about the NFL's ability to appropriately address domestic violence and their commitment to doing so. 

END OF SUMMARY.
