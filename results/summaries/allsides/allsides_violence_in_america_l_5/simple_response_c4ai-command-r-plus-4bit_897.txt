SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. This decision has brought to light the NFL's flawed handling of domestic violence cases and their failure to take such incidents seriously. Rice, a player for the Baltimore Ravens, assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in an elevator in 2014. The NFL initially suspended him for two games and fined him, but after public outcry and the release of a second video of the incident, they suspended him indefinitely. Rice appealed, arguing that the NFL commissioner had abused his power. The arbitrator's decision revealed that the NFL was aware of the facts of the assault and had access to both videos but chose to rely on Rice's description of the events. The NFL's defense arguments, including the suggestion that "slapping" one's partner is somehow better than "hitting" them, cast doubt on their understanding and response to domestic violence. The arbitrator's decision also raises concerns about the NFL's ability to handle future cases of domestic violence effectively and responsibly. The NFL's failure to review all available evidence and their disregard for the seriousness of such incidents indicate a worrying lack of understanding of domestic assault. This case highlights the need for the NFL to improve its response to domestic violence and take stronger action to address it. 

END OF SUMMARY.
