SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal, allowing him to play in the NFL again. This decision reveals a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. Initially, the league went easy on Rice with a light punishment, and only revised it due to public outcry, claiming Rice had misled them about the nature of the assault. However, the arbitrator's finding reveals that the NFL was well-informed and simply didn't take the assault seriously enough. The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence. Their claim that Rice only "slapped" his girlfriend and that she "knocked herself out" is absurd and bizarre. The NFL showed willful blindness and a callous disregard for the seriousness of the assault. This worrying approach by the NFL suggests a lack of understanding of domestic violence and raises concerns about their future handling of such incidents. The revelations indicate that the NFL still has much to learn about appropriately addressing domestic violence. END OF SUMMARY.
