SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially gave Rice a light punishment, then increased it after public outcry, claiming he had misled them about the assault. However, the arbitrator found that the NFL was well-informed about the incident all along and simply didn't think pummeling a woman was worthy of serious punishment. The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence, revealing a callous disregard for its seriousness. The league claimed Rice misled them by downplaying the assault, but the arbitrator recognized this as bullshit. The NFL's failure to watch available video evidence and their reliance on Rice's description of events suggests willful blindness to the assault. This raises questions about how the NFL will handle future domestic violence cases, and whether they will continue to ignore evidence and minimize the seriousness of such incidents. END OF SUMMARY.
