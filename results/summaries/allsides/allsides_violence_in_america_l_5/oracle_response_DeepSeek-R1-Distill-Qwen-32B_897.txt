Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary, up to 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Ray Rice got his suspension overturned, which the author criticizes as a failure by the NFL to handle domestic violence seriously. The article details the assault, the NFL's initial light punishment, their reversal when more information came out, and the arbitrator's decision that the NFL's handling was flawed.

I need to include words like "damning," "indictment," "pummeling," "violence," "easy," "punishment," "assault," "slap," "hit," "unconscious," "drag," "blocking," "stopped," "incident," "aftermath," "offense," "reasonable," "gravity," "crime," "bullshit," "severe," "take," "slapped," "force," "absurd," "contact," "situation," "ridiculous," "events," "blindness," "disregard," "failure," "assaults," "ignore," "minimize."

I should structure the summary to highlight the NFL's mishandling, the arbitrator's decision, and the moral implications. I'll start by stating the arbitrator's decision, then describe the assault, the initial punishment, the reversal, and the arbitrator's findings. I'll emphasize the NFL's failure to take the assault seriously and their inability to understand domestic violence.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, uses the key moral words, and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid adding new information not in the article and focus on the main points: the incident, the NFL's initial and revised punishments, the arbitrator's decision, and the critique of the NFL's approach to domestic violence.

Finally, I'll check that all the morally framed words are included where appropriate, without making the summary too verbose. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, ensuring the moral judgment is clear.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to return to the NFL, in a decision that criticizes the league's handling of domestic violence. Rice assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, knocking her unconscious in an elevator, as captured on video. The NFL initially punished him lightly, then reversed after public outcry, but the arbitrator found their reasoning flawed. The NFL claimed Rice misled them about the assault's severity, but the arbitrator ruled they were aware of the evidence and chose not to act. The league's defense revealed a troubling lack of understanding of domestic violence, as they downplayed the assault as a "slap" and failed to review critical evidence. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to address such incidents seriously in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
