SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play in the NFL again. The decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The league initially went easy on Rice, then reversed itself after a public outcry, claiming he misled them about the nature of the assault. However, the arbitrator found that the NFL was fully aware of the facts of the assault and was therefore barred from imposing a more severe punishment.

The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand or respond to domestic violence. They claimed Rice misled them by downplaying the severity of the assault, but the arbitrator recognized this as bullshit. The NFL's failure to take the assault seriously enough is evident in their arguments, which suggest they still don't understand domestic assault or take it seriously enough.

The decision raises concerns about the NFL's approach to domestic violence, suggesting they may continue to ignore evidence, minimize the seriousness of testimony, and hope the issue goes away. The NFL still has a lot to learn when it comes to domestic violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
