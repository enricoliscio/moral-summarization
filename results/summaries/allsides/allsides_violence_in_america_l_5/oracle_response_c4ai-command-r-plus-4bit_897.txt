SUMMARY: An arbitrator's decision to lift Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL reveals a damning indictment of the league's handling of domestic violence. Despite video evidence of Rice pummeling his then-girlfriend, the NFL initially gave him a light punishment, only to reverse it due to public outcry. The arbitrator found that the NFL was well-informed about the gravity of Rice's crime but chose to go easy on him, indicating a troubling disregard for domestic violence. The league's defense arguments further cast doubt on their understanding of and response to such incidents. The NFL claimed Rice misled them by downplaying the assault, but the arbitrator found their argument absurd and indicative of their continued failure to take domestic violence seriously. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to appropriately address future cases of domestic violence. The league's willingness to ignore evidence and minimize the severity of assault testifies to their callous disregard for the issue. 

END OF SUMMARY.
