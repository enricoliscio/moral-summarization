Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Ray Rice's appeal of his NFL suspension being granted by an arbitrator. It seems like the NFL initially punished him lightly but then changed their decision after public outcry. The arbitrator's decision criticized the NFL's handling of domestic violence.

Hmm, the key points are: Ray Rice assaulted his girlfriend, leading to a two-game suspension and a fine. After more evidence came out, the NFL suspended him indefinitely. Rice appealed, arguing the second punishment was unfair because the NFL knew the details from the start. The arbitrator agreed, saying the NFL couldn't impose a second punishment because they were aware of the severity initially.

The article also talks about how the NFL's arguments during arbitration showed they don't take domestic violence seriously. They tried to say Rice misled them, but the arbitrator saw through that. The NFL had access to more evidence but didn't watch it, which shows they were willfully ignoring the severity of the assault.

So, the summary needs to include the main events: Rice's assault, initial punishment, public reaction leading to a harsher punishment, the appeal granted, and the critique of the NFL's approach to domestic violence. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

I should start by stating the arbitrator's decision, then explain the initial and revised punishments. Mention the assault details briefly. Highlight the NFL's failure to review evidence and their attitude towards domestic violence. Conclude with the implications for future cases.

Let me structure it: Start with the appeal outcome, then the assault, initial punishment, revised punishment, the appeal arguments, the arbitrator's findings, and the critique of the NFL's handling. Make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit.

I need to avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Also, ensure that the summary captures the main issues without getting too bogged down in details. Focus on the NFL's handling and the arbitrator's criticism as the central points.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Let me put it together concisely.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator has overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, citing the league's mishandling of domestic violence cases. Rice, who assaulted his then-girlfriend in 2014, was initially suspended for two games but faced harsher punishment after additional footage emerged. The arbitrator ruled that the NFL knew the severity of the assault from the start but downplayed it, leading to a lenient initial penalty. The NFL's arguments during the arbitration, including claims that Rice misled them about the assault, were deemed disingenuous, as they had access to evidence but chose not to review it. The decision highlights the league's inadequate understanding and response to domestic violence, raising concerns about future cases. END OF SUMMARY.
