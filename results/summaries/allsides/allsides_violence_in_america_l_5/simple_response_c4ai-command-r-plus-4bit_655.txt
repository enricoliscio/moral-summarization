SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension from the NFL, allowing him to play again. This decision reveals a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence cases. Initially, the NFL imposed a light punishment on Rice for assaulting his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, and the arbitrator's decision suggests that the NFL didn't take the assault seriously enough. Despite claiming that Rice misled them, the NFL had access to all the evidence and chose to rely on Rice's description, demonstrating willful blindness and a disregard for the seriousness of domestic violence. The NFL's arguments during the arbitration process indicate that they still don't fully understand or take responsibility for domestic assault. The arbitrator's decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to appropriately handle future cases of domestic violence involving its players. The league's response to Rice's case suggests that they have a long way to go in understanding and responding to this issue. 

END OF SUMMARY.
