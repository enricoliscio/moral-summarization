SUMMARY:

An arbitrator has overturned the indefinite suspension of NFL player Ray Rice, who was punished for assaulting his then-girlfriend in an elevator in 2014. The decision is a scathing critique of the NFL's handling of domestic violence cases. The league initially suspended Rice for two games, but later increased the punishment to an indefinite suspension after a video of the incident was released. The arbitrator found that the NFL was aware of the severity of the assault from the beginning, but chose not to take it seriously. The NFL's defense arguments in the arbitration raised concerns about their ability to understand and respond to domestic violence, suggesting that they still do not take it seriously enough. The league's failure to review all available evidence and their willingness to minimize the seriousness of the assault are particularly concerning. The decision raises questions about how the NFL will handle future domestic violence cases.
