Alright, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Ray Rice's arbitration case and the NFL's handling of domestic violence. My task is to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand the article. It's about how an arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, which the author sees as a failure by the NFL to handle domestic violence seriously. The article details the incident, the initial light punishment, the revised suspension after public outcry, and the arbitration decision. It criticizes the NFL's approach, suggesting they didn't take the assault seriously enough and mishandled the evidence.

For STEP 1, I need to find all single words that carry moral implications. Words like "damning," "easy," "abuse," "pummeling," "unconscious," "drag," "abused," "bullshit," "barred," "light," "unfortunate," "concern," "cast," "doubt," "understand," "respond," "misled," "slapped," "knocked," "absurd," "ridiculous," "willful," "blindness," "callous," "disregard," "bizarre," "reasonable," "approach," "learn," "domestic," "violence." Each of these words conveys a moral judgment or critique of the NFL's actions.

Next, the summary needs to capture the essence while preserving these moral framings. I'll start by stating the arbitrator's decision, then explain the NFL's initial leniency and the reversal. I'll include the details of the assault, the videos, the NFL's mishandling of evidence, and the arbitrator's findings. I'll emphasize the NFL's failure to take domestic violence seriously and the implications for future cases.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including as many morally framed words as possible. I'll structure it to highlight the NFL's shortcomings and the arbitrator's decision, ending with the concern about the league's approach to domestic violence.

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll avoid markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, allowing him to return to the NFL, which highlights the league's flawed handling of domestic violence. Initially, the NFL suspended Rice for two games after he assaulted his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in 2014, knocking her unconscious in an elevator. After additional video evidence emerged, the league revised the punishment to indefinite suspension. However, the arbitrator ruled that the NFL's initial decision, made with full knowledge of the severity, was lenient, and the league's subsequent punishment was barred under its collective bargaining agreement. The NFL's defense, claiming Rice misled them, was criticized as absurd, as they had access to the second video but chose not to view it. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's inability to understand or take domestic violence seriously, suggesting a callous disregard for the seriousness of the assault. This outcome underscores the league's need to improve its approach to addressing such incidents. END OF SUMMARY.
