SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension from the NFL, finding that the league was aware of the facts of his assault on his then-girlfriend and now-wife, Janay Rice, and did not take the incident seriously enough to warrant a severe punishment. The original suspension was based on the NFL's claim that Rice had misled them about the nature of the assault, but the arbitrator's decision reveals that the league had access to all the evidence and chose to rely on Rice's description of the events. The NFL's defense arguments cast doubt on their understanding of and response to domestic violence, with the league suggesting that "slapping" a partner is somehow less severe than "hitting" them. The arbitrator's decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to handle future cases of domestic violence effectively. The decision also highlights the league's willful blindness and disregard for the seriousness of the assault. Overall, the case reveals that the NFL still has a long way to go in addressing domestic violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
