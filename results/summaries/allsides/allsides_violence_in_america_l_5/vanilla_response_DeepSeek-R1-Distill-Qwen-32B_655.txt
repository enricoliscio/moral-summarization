Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Ray Rice and the NFL's handling of his case. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Okay, the article says that an arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite suspension, making him eligible to play again. The arbitrator criticized the NFL's approach to domestic violence. Initially, the NFL gave him a light punishment, but after public outcry, they suspended him indefinitely. However, the arbitrator found that the NFL had all the information but didn't take the assault seriously enough.

Ray Rice assaulted his girlfriend in an elevator, knocking her unconscious. Two videos captured the incident. The NFL first suspended him for two games, then indefinitely after the second video came out. Rice appealed, arguing that the NFL's punishment was unfair because they already knew the details.

The arbitrator agreed, saying the NFL couldn't impose a harsher punishment after the fact. The article criticizes the NFL for not taking domestic violence seriously, pointing out that they relied on Rice's misleading statements instead of watching the available video evidence. It also questions the NFL's ability to handle such cases in the future.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the main events: the arbitrator's decision, the NFL's initial and revised punishments, the incident details, the arbitrator's findings, and the criticism of the NFL's handling of domestic violence.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the arbitrator's decision, mention the initial and revised suspensions, describe the assault, the videos, the NFL's handling, and the criticism. Make sure to highlight that the NFL didn't take the assault seriously and that the arbitrator found their arguments lacking.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in the specifics of the arbitration process but focus on the key outcomes and criticisms. Also, mention the concern about future cases and the NFL's approach to domestic violence.

Let me put it all together, keeping it concise and within the word limit. Make sure each sentence flows logically to the next, covering all the essential points without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: An arbitrator overturned Ray Rice's indefinite NFL suspension, ruling that the league's initial two-game punishment for his 2014 assault on his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, was sufficient. The arbitrator criticized the NFL for not taking the assault seriously at the time, despite having access to video evidence. Rice knocked Palmer unconscious in an elevator, and the NFL initially suspended him for two games, then revised the punishment to indefinite after additional video surfaced. The arbitrator found that the NFL had all the necessary information but chose not to act more severely, suggesting a lack of seriousness toward domestic violence. The league's defense, which claimed Rice misled them about the assault, was deemed flawed, as the arbitrator noted the NFL could have reviewed the evidence but chose not to. The decision raises concerns about the NFL's ability to address domestic violence in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
