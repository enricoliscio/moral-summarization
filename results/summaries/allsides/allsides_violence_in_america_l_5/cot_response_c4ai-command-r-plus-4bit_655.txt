SUMMARY: An arbitrator has granted Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension, allowing him to play in the NFL again. This decision is a damning indictment of the NFL's handling of domestic violence. The NFL initially gave Rice a light punishment, claiming he had misled them about pummeling his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer. However, the arbitrator's decision reveals that the NFL was well-informed and simply didn't take the assault seriously enough. The NFL's defense arguments cast serious doubt on their ability to understand and respond to domestic violence. They claimed Rice had misled them by saying he only "slapped" Palmer, but the arbitrator recognized this as absurd and bizarre, especially since the "slap" knocked Palmer unconscious. The NFL also tried to shift blame to Palmer, suggesting she "knocked herself out." The arbitrator found the NFL showed willful blindness and callous disregard for the seriousness of the assault. The NFL's arguments reveal troubling attitudes and a lack of understanding of domestic violence. This raises concerns about how the NFL will handle future cases of domestic violence. Will they review evidence and understand its seriousness, or will they ignore and minimize it? END OF SUMMARY.
