Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, and it's filled with morally charged words. 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They want a summary that keeps the moral language intact. The original article uses words like "meddling," "attacks," "firing," etc., which carry negative connotations. My job is to make sure these words are included in the summary without changing their moral implications.

I should start by reading the article carefully to grasp the main points. The key elements are Trump's potential firing of Mueller, the Republican senators' warnings, the ongoing investigation into Russian interference, and Trump's frustration with the probe's duration. Also, there's criticism from within the Republican party about Trump's actions.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words and ensure they're included. Words like "meddling," "attacks," "firing," "probe," "interference," "corrupted," etc., are crucial. I'll need to structure the summary to highlight the tension between Trump and the Senate, emphasizing the risks if Trump fires Mueller.

I should also keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll need to condense the information without losing the moral weight. Maybe start by stating the senators' warnings, then Trump's actions, followed by the consequences and internal Republican criticism.

I have to be careful not to add any neutral language that might dilute the moral framing. Each sentence should reflect the original article's tone, showing the conflict and the potential fallout for Trump's presidency.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the warnings, Trump's frustration, the potential firing, and the internal pushback. This structure should maintain the moral narrative effectively.

SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of letting the federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election continue. Trump has renewed attacks on the FBI and Mueller’s investigation, sparking concerns about interference. Senator Jeff Flake criticized Trump’s comments, suggesting they could lead to Mueller’s dismissal, which Flake warned would be disastrous for Trump’s presidency. Lindsey Graham echoed this, stating Mueller should not be fired unless for cause. Trump’s frustration with the prolonged probe has led to accusations of it being a politically motivated witch hunt, with his lawyer, John Dowd, urging an end to the investigation. However, Gowdy criticized Dowd, urging Trump to act as if his administration were innocent. Trump’s firing of Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director, has drawn criticism, with Rubio stating it was poorly timed. McCabe’s lawyer called Trump’s tweets “childish, defamatory, and false,” asserting the process was corrupted. The article underscores the risks for Trump if he thwarts the investigation, highlighting the moral and political stakes involved. END OF SUMMARY.
