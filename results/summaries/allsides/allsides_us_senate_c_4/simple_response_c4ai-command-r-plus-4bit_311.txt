SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election and any collusion with the Trump campaign. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham said firing Mueller would be unacceptable and could be the "beginning of the end" of Trump's presidency. The warning came after Trump's recent attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, suggesting the president may be considering dismissing Mueller. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied this, but the senators' comments underscored the serious risks for Trump if he interferes in the probe. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, urged the Justice Department to end the Russia investigation, drawing criticism from Republicans. The firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who claimed he was targeted for corroborating claims about Trump's pressure on the FBI, also drew criticism from Republicans. Trump's tweets attacking McCabe were called "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false" by McCabe's lawyer. The summary highlights the ethical concerns of Republican senators and their efforts to prevent any interference in the Russia investigation, despite Trump's frustration with the probe.
END OF SUMMARY.
