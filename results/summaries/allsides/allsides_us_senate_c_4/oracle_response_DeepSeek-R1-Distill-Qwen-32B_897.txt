Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, the special counsel. Trump is attacking the FBI and Mueller, and there's tension over the Russia probe. Some Republicans are pushing back, fearing it could end Trump's presidency. Trump claims the probe is a witch hunt, and there's criticism over the firing of McCabe.

Now, I need to identify the key morally charged words from the list. Words like "meddling," "attacks," "firing," "probe," "interference," "collusion," "pressure," "killing," "leaked," "defamatory," "corrupted," etc.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. Start with Trump under pressure from Republicans, mention the attacks on FBI and Mueller, the risk of firing Mueller, the pushback from senators, Trump's frustration, and the criticism over McCabe's firing.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence incorporates the moral terms without making it sound forced.

I'll check the word count as I go. Maybe combine some points to save space. For example, mention Trump's Twitter attacks and the firing of McCabe in one sentence. Also, include the consequences of firing Mueller as highlighted by the senators.

Finally, I'll review to ensure all key moral terms are included and the summary accurately reflects the article's content while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Republican senators have warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of allowing the federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election to proceed without interference. Trump has renewed his attacks on the FBI and Mueller’s investigation, particularly after the firing of Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham cautioned that dismissing Mueller could mark the "beginning of the end" of Trump's presidency. Flake expressed concern that efforts to fire Mueller were "building" and urged congressional pushback. Trump, meanwhile, has criticized the Russia probe as a politically motivated witch hunt, claiming there was no collusion or crime. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied any consideration of Mueller's removal, but Trump's frustration with the prolonged probe remains evident. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy criticized Trump's attorney, John Dowd, for framing the investigation as a "manufactured" witch hunt. Trump also faced criticism for the firing of McCabe, with Rubio and others questioning the timing and rationale. McCabe’s lawyer, Michael Bromwich, accused Trump of defamatory and false claims, stating the truth would eventually emerge. END OF SUMMARY.
