Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, who's investigating Russian interference in the election. Trump has been attacking the FBI and Mueller on Twitter, especially after firing McCabe. Flake and Graham are concerned that firing Mueller would be bad for Trump's presidency. The White House says they're not considering firing Mueller, but there's still tension. Trump is frustrated with the probe's length and thinks it's a witch hunt. Some Republicans support Mueller, while others like Dowd are trying to end the investigation. McCabe's lawyer says Trump's tweets are defamatory. The article emphasizes the risks for Trump if he interferes with the investigation.

I need to capture the key points: the warning from senators, Trump's Twitter attacks, the potential consequences of firing Mueller, the White House's denial, Trump's frustration, Republican support for Mueller, and the implications of the situation. I should keep the moral aspect, like the importance of not obstructing justice and the potential damage to Trump's presidency. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Republican senators have cautioned President Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the need for federal investigators to continue probing Russian election interference. Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller, following the firing of Andrew McCabe, have raised concerns about potential interference. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham warned that dismissing Mueller could gravely damage Trump's presidency. The White House denied any plans to fire Mueller, but Trump's frustration with the probe's duration and his characterization of it as a politically motivated witch hunt have drawn criticism. Some Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, stress the importance of allowing Mueller to work without obstruction. Meanwhile, Trump's attorney, John Dowd, has called for ending the investigation, sparking further Republican debate. McCabe's firing, reportedly due to leaks, has also faced criticism, with his lawyer condemning Trump's tweets as defamatory. The situation underscores the risks for Trump if he continues to challenge the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
