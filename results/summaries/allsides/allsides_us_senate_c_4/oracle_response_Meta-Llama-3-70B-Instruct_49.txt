SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as he renewed his attacks on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Trump's comments appeared to be building towards dismissing Mueller, which would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency," according to Senator Lindsey Graham. The president's actions sparked concerns that he was trying to thwart the federal probe, with Senator Jeff Flake urging Trump to let investigators do their job. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, was criticized for urging the Justice Department to end the investigation, which was seen as an attempt to interfere with the probe. The president's firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was also met with criticism, with many Republicans arguing that it was an attempt to pressure and kill the Russia probe. The morally charged language used by the author highlights the gravity of Trump's actions, which are seen as an attack on the integrity of the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
