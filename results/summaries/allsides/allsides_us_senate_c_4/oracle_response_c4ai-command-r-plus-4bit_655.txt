SUMMARY: Republican senators have warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump has recently intensified his attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, leading to concerns that he may be planning to dismiss Mueller. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would have severe consequences for Trump's presidency. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering such action. However, Trump's comments and actions have raised concerns among Republicans about interference in the federal probe. The president has accused the FBI leadership of corruption and leaking information, and has called the Russia investigation a "witch hunt." The recent firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe has also drawn criticism, with McCabe's lawyer calling Trump's tweets "defamatory." Trump's frustration with the Mueller probe and his attacks on former FBI officials raise questions about his intentions and the potential for obstruction of justice. The situation underscores the delicate balance between the executive branch and federal investigators in upholding the integrity of the U.S. democratic process.
END OF SUMMARY.
