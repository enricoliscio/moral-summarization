SUMMARY:

Republican senators have warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Trump has renewed his Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, sparking concerns that he may try to dismiss Mueller. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham said that firing Mueller would be a grave mistake, with Graham warning it would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House has denied that Trump is considering firing Mueller. Trump has accused the FBI leadership of lies, corruption, and leaking information, and has called the Russia probe a "witch hunt." Republicans have urged Trump to let Mueller complete his investigation, with some criticizing the president's recent tweets as "childish" and "defamatory."
