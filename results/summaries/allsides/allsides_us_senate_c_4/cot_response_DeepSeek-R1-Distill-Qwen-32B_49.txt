Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. The user mentioned that this should be labeled as STEP 1 and each word should be on a new line starting with an asterisk. So, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "warned," "attack," "firing," "meddling," "interfere," "frustrated," "corrupt," "dishonest," "legitimate," "corrupt," "disgrace," "interfere," "collusion," "crime," "witch hunt," "innocent," "frustrated," "targeted," "defamatory," "false," and "corrupted" stand out as having moral implications.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, preserving as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll focus on the key points: Republican senators warning Trump about firing Mueller, the risks involved, Trump's frustration, the investigation into Russian meddling, and the criticism from various parties.

I should ensure that the summary flows naturally while incorporating the identified moral terms. It's important to maintain the original moral framing without adding personal opinions. I'll structure the summary to cover the main events and the reactions from both Trump and the Republicans, highlighting the tension and the stakes involved.

I also need to make sure the summary is clear and concise, capturing the essence of the article without unnecessary details. By focusing on the moral aspects, the summary will reflect the underlying tensions and ethical concerns present in the original text.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and effectively conveys the moral framing as required. This approach should fulfill the user's request accurately and efficiently.

### SUMMARY:
Republican senators have warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of allowing federal investigators to probe Russian meddling in the 2016 election without interference. Trump has been increasingly frustrated with the investigation, calling it a politically motivated witch hunt, and has criticized the FBI and Mueller. Some Republicans, like Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, have expressed concern that firing Mueller could mark the "beginning of the end" of Trump's presidency. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, has also urged the Justice Department to end the probe, drawing criticism from other Republicans. Meanwhile, Trump's recent firing of Andrew McCabe, the FBI's former deputy director, has further fueled speculation about potential interference with the investigation. Senators like Rubio and Gowdy have criticized the handling of McCabe's firing, with Rubio stating it should have been delayed until after the release of a relevant report. McCabe's lawyer has also accused Trump of defamatory and false claims, calling the process illegitimate. END OF SUMMARY.
