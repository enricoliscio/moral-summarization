SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be disastrous for Trump's presidency. The warning came after Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, with Trump claiming the investigation was a witch hunt and accusing FBI leadership of lies and corruption. Trump's personal lawyer called for an end to the investigation, drawing criticism from Republicans. Trump's frustration with the probe was acknowledged by the White House legislative affairs director, who affirmed cooperation with the investigation. Republicans also expressed disapproval over the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, with Senator Marco Rubio calling it improper. McCabe's lawyer denounced Trump's tweets as childish and defamatory. The Republican comments highlighted the potential consequences for Trump if he attempts to obstruct the federal probe.
