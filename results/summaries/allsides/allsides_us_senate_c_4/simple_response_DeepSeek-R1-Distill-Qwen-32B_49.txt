Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first.

The article is about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller. Theyâ€™re emphasizing the importance of letting the investigation proceed. There's a lot of back and forth about Trump's tweets, the firing of McCabe, and the reactions from different senators and representatives.

I need to capture the key points: the warning from Republicans, the risks if Trump fires Mueller, the frustration from Trump about the probe's duration, and the criticism from within his party. Also, the moral aspect is about the integrity of the investigation and the potential consequences for Trump's presidency.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral implications without adding my own opinions. Focus on the main events and the reactions, especially the Republican pushback and the potential end of Trump's presidency if he fires Mueller.

Let me structure it: start with the warning, mention the risks, include Trump's frustration, the criticism from Republicans, and the overall tension. Make sure to include the quotes from Flake and Graham to show the moral stance against interfering with the investigation.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it within the word limit and ensuring all key points are covered while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Republican senators have warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of allowing federal investigators to continue their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller, following the firing of Andrew McCabe, have raised concerns about potential interference. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham have criticized Trump, with Graham stating that firing Mueller would signal "the beginning of the end of his presidency." Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan's spokeswoman also defended Mueller's work. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, called for an end to the Russia probe, drawing criticism from GOP Representative Trey Gowdy, who urged Trump to act as if his client were innocent. Trump's frustration with the probe's duration has been expressed, but White House officials deny considering Mueller's removal. The firing of McCabe, who was involved in the Russia investigation, has also drawn criticism from Rubio and others, who questioned the timing and justification. Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential Trump campaign collusion remains a contentious issue, with Republicans urging Trump to avoid actions that could undermine the probe's integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
