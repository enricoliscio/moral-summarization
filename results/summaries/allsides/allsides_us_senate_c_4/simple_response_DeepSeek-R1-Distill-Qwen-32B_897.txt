Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Republican senators warning President Trump not to fire Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel. They're emphasizing that Trump should let the federal investigators do their jobs regarding the Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump has been attacking the FBI and Mueller on Twitter, especially after firing Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director. McCabe was fired just before he could retire with a full pension, which seems suspicious.

Senator Jeff Flake, who's been critical of Trump, says Trump's comments seem aimed at firing Mueller. Lindsey Graham, another Republican senator, warns that firing Mueller would be the beginning of the end for Trump's presidency. Paul Ryan's spokeswoman also supports Mueller's work. The White House tried to clarify that Trump isn't considering firing Mueller, but Flake and others are concerned it's building up to that, and they'll push back.

Trump has been tweeting about the FBI's leadership being corrupt and the Russia probe being a witch hunt. He claims the Mueller probe shouldn't have started because there was no collusion. His lawyer, John Dowd, urged the Justice Department to end the investigation, which drew criticism from Representative Trey Gowdy. Trump's team says they're cooperating with Mueller but are frustrated with the probe's duration.

Graham mentions legislation that makes it harder for a president to fire a special counsel, and he believes Mueller should proceed without interference. Rubio, another Republican, criticizes the firing of McCabe, saying it was done before a report was released and that McCabe was targeted because he corroborated Comey's claims about Trump pressuring him to stop the probe.

McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called Trump's tweets defamatory and false, stating the truth will come out eventually.

So, the moral framing here is about the integrity of the investigation, the potential overreach of the presidency, and the importance of upholding the rule of law. The author seems to present the Republicans as concerned about Trump's actions undermining the investigation, highlighting the tension between the executive branch and the investigation's independence.

I need to summarize all this in 200 words, focusing on the key points: Republican senators warning Trump, Trump's attacks on Mueller and the FBI, the potential consequences of firing Mueller, the White House's denial, and the broader implications for the presidency and the investigation's integrity.

I should make sure to include the main actors, their positions, and the moral implications without getting bogged down in too much detail. Also, I need to keep the language clear and concise, sticking to the key points and the moral framing.
