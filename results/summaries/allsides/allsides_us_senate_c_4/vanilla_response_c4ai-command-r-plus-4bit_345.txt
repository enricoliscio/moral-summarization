SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. A spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan also supported Mueller's investigation. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering firing Mueller. Trump has been critical of the FBI and Mueller's probe, calling it a politically motivated witch hunt. Trump's personal lawyer called for an end to the investigation, while other Republicans, such as Trey Gowdy, criticized this stance. Trump's frustration with the probe was noted by White House legislative affairs director Marc Short. Senator Marco Rubio also criticized the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, saying he should have been allowed to finish his term. McCabe's lawyer called Trump's tweets "childish and defamatory." 

END OF SUMMARY.
