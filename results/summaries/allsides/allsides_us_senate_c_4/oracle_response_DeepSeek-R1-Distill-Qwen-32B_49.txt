Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, the special counsel. Trump is attacking the FBI and Mueller, and there's tension over the Russia probe. Some Republicans are pushing back, saying firing Mueller would be bad. The White House denies considering it, but there's concern about interference. Trump's frustration is evident, and he's been critical of the probe. The article also mentions McCabe's firing and the potential corruption of the process.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the warning from senators, mention Trump's attacks, the risk of firing Mueller, the White House's denial, and the pushback from Republicans. I'll include the moral terms like'meddling,' 'attacks,' 'firing,' 'probe,' 'interference,' etc. I should ensure the summary flows well and includes the key moral points without being too detailed.

Let me structure it: Start with the warning, then Trump's actions, the potential consequences, the White House's statement, and the ongoing tension. Make sure to use the moral words where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay under 200. 

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure each sentence captures the essence and includes the necessary moral framing.

SUMMARY: Republican senators have warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of letting the federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election continue without interference. Trump has renewed attacks on the FBI and Mueller’s investigation, particularly after the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham cautioned that dismissing Mueller could mark the "beginning of the end" of Trump’s presidency, while House Speaker Paul Ryan’s spokeswoman stated Mueller should be allowed to do his job. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump is considering Mueller’s removal, but Flake warned that pressure to fire Mueller is building and urged congressional pushback. Trump has accused the FBI of lies, corruption, and leaking information, calling the Russia probe a politically motivated witch hunt. He also attacked former FBI Director James Comey and McCabe, who were involved in the investigation. Republican Representative Trey Gowdy criticized Trump’s attorney for framing the probe negatively, while Rubio expressed concern over McCabe’s firing, suggesting it was premature. Trump’s comments have been described as defamatory and corrupting the process, with McCabe’s lawyer stating the truth will eventually come out. END OF SUMMARY.
