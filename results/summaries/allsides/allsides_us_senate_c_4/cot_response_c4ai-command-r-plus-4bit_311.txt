SUMMARY:
Republican senators issued stark warnings to President Donald Trump on Sunday, urging him not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be "the beginning of the end" of Trump's presidency. The senators' comments underscored the risks Trump faces if he attempts to obstruct the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Trump's recent attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have fueled speculation about his intentions. In response, the White House reiterated that Trump is not considering removing Mueller. However, Senator Flake and other Republicans expressed concern that Trump's actions appear to be building towards Mueller's dismissal. They emphasized the importance of allowing Mueller to proceed without interference. Meanwhile, Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, called for an end to the "manufactured" Russia collusion investigation. Trump's frustration with the probe was echoed by White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, who claimed the president was expressing his growing frustration with the prolonged investigation. Trump also faced criticism from Republicans over the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, with Senator Marco Rubio stating that he should have been allowed to finish his tenure. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, described Trump's tweets as "childish, defamatory, disgusting, and false," accusing the president of corrupting the process.
