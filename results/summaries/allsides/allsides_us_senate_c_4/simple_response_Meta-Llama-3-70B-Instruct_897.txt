SUMMARY:

Republican senators warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators do their job in probing Russian meddling in the US election. Trump's renewed Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have raised concerns that he may be planning to dismiss Mueller. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham cautioned that firing Mueller would have severe consequences, with Graham stating it would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House has denied that Trump is considering firing Mueller, but the president's actions have sparked widespread criticism. Trump's attacks on former FBI officials, including James Comey and Andrew McCabe, have been deemed "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false" by McCabe's lawyer. The moral imperative is clear: Trump must allow the investigation to proceed without interference, and respect the integrity of the justice system.
