SUMMARY:

Republican senators warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators probe Russian meddling in the US election do their jobs. Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have sparked concerns that he may try to dismiss Mueller. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham cautioned that firing Mueller would be a grave mistake, with Graham saying it would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House has denied that Trump is considering firing Mueller, but Republican lawmakers are urging caution, recognizing the risks of thwarting the federal probe. Trump's attacks on the FBI and Mueller have been criticized as an attempt to discredit the investigation and undermine the rule of law.
