Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the morally charged words. Let me read through the text again to pick out those words.

The article starts with Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller. Words like "warned," "fire," "let federal investigators do their jobs" – those are strong verbs with moral implications. Then, it mentions Trump renewing Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller. "Attacks" is a moral term here, implying criticism or aggression.

Senator Flake says Trump's comments seem aimed at firing Mueller, and Lindsey Graham warns that firing Mueller would be the "beginning of the end of his presidency." "Underscored the risks" is another moral framing, showing the potential negative consequences.

The White House lawyer issues a statement denying consideration of firing Mueller, using " tamp down the chatter," which implies trying to calm fears. Flake hopes it doesn't go there because it "can’t" happen, showing a moral stance against it.

Trump's tweets accuse the FBI of lies, corruption, leaking info, and calls the probe a witch hunt. These are all strong moral terms, indicating he's attacking the integrity of the investigation. He also says the Mueller probe shouldn't have started because there was no collusion or crime, which is a moral argument against the investigation's validity.

Rubio criticizes the firing of McCabe, saying he should have been allowed to finish through the weekend, indicating a moral concern about the process. Gowdy criticizes Trump's attorney for disservice, framing it as a betrayal of trust. Sessions cites a report about leaking and misleading, which are moral failings.

McCabe's lawyer calls Trump's tweets childish, defamatory, and false, again using strong moral language to denounce the president's actions.

So, I've identified a lot of morally framed words: warned, fire, attacks, risks, tamper, can't, witch hunt, lies, corruption, leaking, witch hunt, collusion, crime, frustration, interfere, cause, targeted, corroborated, defamatory, false, corrupted, illegitimate.

Now, I need to write a concise summary that includes these terms as much as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the essence of the article, focusing on the moral aspects. I'll structure it to include the key points: senators warning Trump, Trump's attacks, the potential consequences, Flake and Graham's statements, the White House denial, Trump's tweets, Rubio's criticism, Gowdy's criticism, and McCabe's lawyer's response.

I should make sure to include the moral framing words to maintain the author's perspective. Let me piece this together, ensuring each sentence incorporates these terms where appropriate.
