Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with a moral framing. They provided a detailed article about Trump and Mueller, and they want me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a concise summary preserving those terms.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. So, I'll go through the article and pick out words like "warned," "firing," "interfere," "attacks," etc., that convey a moral judgment.

Next, I'll list each of these words with a star before them. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture the essence of the article, highlighting the conflict between Trump and Mueller, the Republican senators' stance, and the implications of Trump's actions.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes key points like the warnings from senators, Trump's frustration, the potential consequences of firing Mueller, and the criticism from various parties. I'll need to be concise but thorough, ensuring that the moral elements are preserved as per the user's request.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing the words and then the SUMMARY section, making sure to end with the specified tokens. I'll double-check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all morally framed words are appropriately included.

**SUMMARY:**

Republican senators have warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of allowing federal investigators to probe Russian meddling in the 2016 election without interference. Trump has faced criticism for his recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller, which some see as targeting Mueller's removal. Senators like Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham have expressed concern that firing Mueller would mark the "beginning of the end" of Trump's presidency, urging Congress to oppose such a move. Trump has accused the FBI of corruption and called the Russia probe a politically motivated witch hunt, while his attorney, John Dowd, has called for the investigation to end. Meanwhile, Trump's firing of Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director, has drawn criticism from Republicans, with some questioning the timing and justification. The White House has denied considering Mueller's removal, but the situation highlights the risks of Trump's actions in thwarting the federal probe. END OF SUMMARY.
