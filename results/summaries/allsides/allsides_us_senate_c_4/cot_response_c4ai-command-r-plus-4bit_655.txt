SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Donald Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be disastrous for Trump's presidency. The warning came after Trump's recent attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, which he called a "witch hunt." Trump's lawyer, Ty Cobb, denied plans to dismiss Mueller, but the president's tweets and actions have raised concerns among Republicans about the investigation's integrity. Senator Graham emphasized the importance of letting Mueller proceed without interference, and Senator Flake urged pushback against any attempt to fire the special counsel. Trump's criticism of the FBI and his frustration with the Russia probe have been deemed corrosive and potentially harmful to the rule of law. The firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who alleged he was targeted for corroborating claims of Trump's pressure to end the Russia probe, further fueled concerns. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called Trump's actions illegitimate and corrupt. The White House legislative affairs director, Marc Short, claimed cooperation with Mueller's investigation but acknowledged Trump's frustration with its duration. Republicans, including Representative Trey Gowdy, criticized Trump's lawyer for framing the investigation as a disservice to the president. The Republican comments underscored the risks of thwarting the federal probe and the need to respect the rule of law.
