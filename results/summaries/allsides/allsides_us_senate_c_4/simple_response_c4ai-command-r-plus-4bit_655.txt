SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering dismissing Mueller, but Trump's recent tweets attacking the FBI and the Russia probe have fueled speculation. Republicans emphasized the importance of allowing Mueller to proceed without interference, and some criticized Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, for framing the investigation as a "witch hunt." Trump also faced criticism from Republicans for firing former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, with Senator Marco Rubio stating that McCabe should have been allowed to finish his term. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called Trump's tweets "childish and defamatory." The episode underscores the ethical dilemma facing Republicans as they weigh their support for Trump against the need to uphold the integrity of federal investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
