SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham said firing Mueller would be a serious mistake, with Graham calling it "the beginning of the end of his presidency." Other Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Marco Rubio, also voiced support for Mueller's investigation. Trump has been increasingly critical of Mueller's probe, calling it a politically motivated witch hunt, and his personal lawyer has urged the Justice Department to end it. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering firing Mueller, but the president's attacks have raised concerns among Republicans about interference in the investigation. Senator Graham emphasized that Mueller should be allowed to proceed without interference, and legislation he co-authored would make it harder for a president to fire a special counsel. Trump's frustration with the investigation was characterized as childish and damaging to the integrity of the process by McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich. 

END OF SUMMARY.
