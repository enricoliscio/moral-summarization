Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, the special counsel. It's important to highlight the tension between Trump and the investigators, and the potential consequences if Trump interferes. I should mention Flake and Graham's warnings, the White House's denial, and Trump's frustration. Also, include the criticism from Rubio and others about the firing of McCabe. Need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral implications are clear, like the threat to the rule of law and accountability. I'll structure it to show Trump's actions and the Republican response, emphasizing the risks involved.

SUMMARY: Republican senators have cautioned President Donald Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of allowing federal investigators to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election without interference. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham warned that such a move could gravely damage Trump's presidency, with Flake stating that Congress would not accept Mueller's dismissal. Trump has increasingly criticized the FBI and Mueller's investigation, calling it a politically motivated witch hunt, while his lawyer has urged the Justice Department to end the probe. However, the White House has denied considering Mueller's removal. Trump's actions have drawn criticism from fellow Republicans, including Representative Trey Gowdy, who urged Trump to act as if his administration were innocent. Meanwhile, Trump's frustration with the prolonged investigation has been evident, and his firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has further raised concerns about political interference. Critics argue that Trump's actions risk undermining the rule of law and accountability, with Flake warning of significant pushback if Mueller is fired. END OF SUMMARY.
