Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I have to make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, who is the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump has been attacking the FBI and Mueller on Twitter, especially after firing Andrew McCabe. Senators like Flake and Graham are concerned that firing Mueller would be bad for Trump's presidency. The White House denied considering Mueller's removal. Trump is frustrated with the probe's duration and claims there was no collusion. Some Republicans support Mueller's investigation, while others, like Dowd, suggest ending it. McCabe's firing is controversial, with Rubio and others criticizing the timing. McCabe's lawyer called Trump's tweets defamatory and corrupting the process.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list and incorporate them into the summary. Words like "meddling," "attacks," "firing," "probe," "thwart," "collusion," "defamatory," "corrupted," etc., should be included.

I'll structure the summary to cover the main events: senators warning Trump, Trump's Twitter attacks, the denial from the White House, the potential consequences of firing Mueller, Trump's claims, and the criticism surrounding McCabe's firing.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll make sure each sentence includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft the summary step by step, checking each sentence for the inclusion of the moral words and the overall coherence.

I think the initial summary provided by the user is already good, but I can make it a bit more concise while preserving the moral framing. Maybe combine some sentences or rephrase to include more of the key terms.

Wait, the user's initial summary is 180 words, which is under 200. Maybe I can add a bit more detail without exceeding the limit, ensuring all key points are covered.

I'll make sure to mention the Republican senators' warnings, Trump's attacks, the firing of McCabe, the potential dismissal of Mueller, the thwarting of the probe, the building towards firing Mueller, the defamatory tweets, and the corrupted process.

I think that covers most of the morally framed words. Now, I'll put it all together in a concise manner.
