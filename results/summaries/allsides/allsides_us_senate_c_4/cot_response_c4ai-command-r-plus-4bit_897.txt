SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Trump has renewed attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe since the firing of former deputy director Andrew McCabe. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham warned that firing Mueller would be disastrous for Trump's presidency. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied plans to dismiss Mueller, but Trump continued his Twitter attacks, accusing the FBI of corruption and claiming the Russia probe was a witch hunt. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, urged the end of the investigation, drawing criticism from fellow Republicans. Trump's frustration with the probe was expressed by White House legislative affairs director Marc Short. The warning from Republicans underscored the risks for Trump if he interferes with the investigation. Senator Marco Rubio criticized the firing of McCabe, saying it was unjustified and illegitimate. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called Trump's tweets childish and defamatory. The president's actions and comments have raised concerns about corruption and interference in the justice process.
