Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Republican senators warning President Trump not to fire Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel. They're concerned about the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump has been attacking the FBI and Mueller on Twitter, especially after firing Andrew McCabe. Flake and Graham are against firing Mueller, saying it would be bad for Trump's presidency. The White House denied considering Mueller's removal. Trump claims the probe was politically motivated and without merit. Some Republicans support Mueller's investigation, and Trump's actions are causing criticism. McCabe's lawyer is defending him against Trump's accusations. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points like the senators' warnings, Trump's attacks, the White House's denial, and the implications of firing Mueller. I should make sure to cover all these elements without going into too much detail. Let me structure it to highlight the main issues: the political pressure on Trump, the potential consequences of firing Mueller, and the ongoing criticism from various fronts. I'll make sure to mention the key players and their positions. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is important. I think I've got all the necessary points. Time to put it together succinctly.
