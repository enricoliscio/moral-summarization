SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have raised concerns about interference and thwarting the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham criticized Trump's comments, with Graham stating that firing Mueller would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House denied that Trump was considering firing Mueller, but Trump's tweets accused the FBI leadership of lies, corruption, and leaking information, and attacked former FBI Director James Comey and fired official Andrew McCabe. Trump's personal lawyer John Dowd urged the Justice Department to end the investigation, which was criticized by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy. The firing of McCabe was also criticized by Republicans, with Senator Marco Rubio saying it was not handled properly. The morally charged language used in the article highlights the gravity of the situation, with words like "meddling", "influence", "collusion", "pressure", and "corrupted" emphasizing the potential wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
