SUMMARY:

Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as Trump renewed his Twitter attacks on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mueller's probe. The president's comments appeared to be aimed at dismissing Mueller, which would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency," according to Senator Lindsey Graham. Trump accused the FBI leadership of lies, corruption, and leaking information, calling the Russia probe a politically motivated witch hunt. He also attacked former FBI Director James Comey and McCabe, top officials involved in the Russia probe and subsequently fired. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Moscow conducted an influence campaign aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election to Trump. Mueller is investigating the Russian meddling and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Republicans urged Trump to let Mueller proceed without interference, warning that firing him would be a grave mistake.
