Okay, so I'm trying to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, the Special Counsel. They're concerned about the Russia probe and the implications of such an action. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I need to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

I should start by identifying the key events: Trump's Twitter attacks, the firing of McCabe, senators' warnings, and the potential consequences if Trump fires Mueller. I need to use words like "meddling," "attacks," "firing," "probe," "thwart," etc., to maintain the moral tone.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning the senators' warnings, Trump's frustration, the potential risks, and the broader implications for the presidency and rule of law.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the senators' advice, then Trump's actions, the risks, and the possible pushback. Make sure to include the morally framed words throughout.

SUMMARY: Republican senators have warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the importance of allowing federal investigators to continue their probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump’s renewed attacks on the FBI and Mueller’s investigation, following the firing of Andrew McCabe, have raised concerns about potential interference. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham cautioned that dismissing Mueller could mark the "beginning of the end" of Trump’s presidency. Flake expressed hope for congressional pushback if Trump moves to fire Mueller, while Graham stressed that Mueller should only be removed for cause, which he sees as nonexistent. Trump’s frustration with the prolonged probe has been evident, but White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied any consideration of Mueller’s removal. Meanwhile, Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called for ending the Russia collusion investigation, drawing criticism from Republican Representative Trey Gowdy. The firing of McCabe, who was reportedly targeted for corroborating Comey’s claims of Trump’s pressure to kill the probe, has further fueled tensions. Trump’s critics argue his actions have corrupted the process, with McCabe’s lawyer calling his tweets "childish, defamatory, and false." The situation underscores the risks of thwarting the federal probe and the potential for political interference in the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
