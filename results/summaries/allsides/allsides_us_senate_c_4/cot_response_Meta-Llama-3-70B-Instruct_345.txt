SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and said the president must let federal investigators looking into Russian meddling in the U.S. election do their jobs without interference. Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have been criticized as "lies", "corruption", and a "witch hunt". Republican Senator Jeff Flake said Trump's comments appeared to be aimed at the firing of Mueller, which would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency". Trump's personal lawyer John Dowd urged the Justice Department to "bring an end" to the investigation, which was criticized by Republican U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy. The firing of Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director, was also criticized as "childish", "defamatory", and "disgusting". END OF SUMMARY.
