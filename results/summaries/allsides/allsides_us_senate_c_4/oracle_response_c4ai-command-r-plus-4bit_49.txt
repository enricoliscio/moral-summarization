SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. The warning came after Trump intensified his attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe following the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who claimed he was targeted for corroborating claims that Trump tried to pressure the FBI into killing the Russia probe. Trump's personal lawyer called for an end to the investigation, while some Republicans criticized the president's handling of the situation. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering dismissing Mueller, but the Republican comments highlight the risks Trump faces if he attempts to thwart the federal probe. Senator Graham emphasized the importance of allowing Mueller to proceed without interference, and Senator Rubio criticized the firing of McCabe, stating that it should not have happened. Trump's tweets attacking McCabe were also condemned as "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false" by McCabe's lawyer. The situation has raised concerns about possible interference and corruption in the investigation process.
END OF SUMMARY.
