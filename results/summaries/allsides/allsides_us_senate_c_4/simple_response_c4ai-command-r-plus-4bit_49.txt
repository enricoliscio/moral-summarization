SUMMARY: Republican senators have warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have raised concerns among Republicans, with Senator Jeff Flake and Senator Lindsey Graham stating that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering such a move. The Republican comments reflect the potential consequences of Trump obstructing the federal probe. Senator Graham emphasized the importance of allowing Mueller to proceed without interference, and Representative Trey Gowdy criticized Trump's lawyer for suggesting the investigation should end. The firing of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, which Trump celebrated, also drew criticism from Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, denounced Trump's tweets as "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false." The episode highlights the ethical dilemma faced by Republicans in their support for Trump's presidency while also upholding the integrity of federal investigations.
