SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election and any potential collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump has intensified his attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe following the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham warned that firing Mueller would be disastrous for Trump's presidency. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering dismissing Mueller. Other Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio, criticized the firing of McCabe, which they saw as an attempt to thwart the Russia probe. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, called for an end to the investigation, drawing rebuke from fellow Republican Trey Gowdy. The president's tweets attacking the FBI and the Mueller probe have raised concerns among Republicans about interference and corruption. Trump's actions have been described as attempts to influence and pressure those involved in the investigation.
