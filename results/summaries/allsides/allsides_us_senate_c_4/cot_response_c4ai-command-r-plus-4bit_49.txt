SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. The senators underscored the risks of thwarting the probe, warning that firing Mueller would mark "the beginning of the end" of Trump's presidency. Trump's recent attacks on the FBI and Mueller's investigation, including accusations of corruption and leaking, have fueled concerns about his intentions. In response, the White House denied any plans to fire Mueller, but the president's harsh criticism of the investigation and those involved persists. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham emphasized the importance of allowing Mueller to proceed without interference, sharing the view that Mueller's dismissal would only be justified for cause. The article also highlights Trump's frustration with the investigation's duration and his lawyer's call for its end. The firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, allegedly for corruption, added to concerns about interference in the probe, with McCabe's lawyer calling the process illegitimate. Rubio, another Republican, supported the special counsel probe but criticized the timing of McCabe's firing.
END OF SUMMARY.
