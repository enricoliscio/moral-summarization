SUMMARY:

Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators do their job in probing Russian meddling in the US election. Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have sparked concerns that he may try to dismiss Mueller. Republican Senator Jeff Flake criticized Trump's comments, saying they appeared aimed at firing Mueller, while Senator Lindsey Graham warned that such a move would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House later denied that Trump was considering firing Mueller. The episode highlights the risks for Trump if he tries to thwart the federal probe, with many Republicans urging him to let Mueller do his job without interference.
