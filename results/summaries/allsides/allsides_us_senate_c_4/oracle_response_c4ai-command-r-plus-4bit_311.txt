SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. The warning came after Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, in which he called the investigation a "witch hunt." Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, also urged the Justice Department to end the Russia collusion investigation. In response to these developments, White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering firing Mueller. However, Republican lawmakers emphasized the importance of letting Mueller proceed without interference and expressed concern over Trump's apparent attempts to thwart the federal probe. Senator Marco Rubio also criticized the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, suggesting that it was unjustified. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called Trump's tweets about his client "defamatory" and accused the president of corrupting the termination process. These developments highlight the ethical dilemmas faced by lawmakers and the potential consequences of Trump's actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
