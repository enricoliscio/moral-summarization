SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators do their job in probing Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have sparked concerns that he may be building towards firing Mueller, which would be a "beginning of the end" of his presidency. Republican Senator Jeff Flake criticized Trump's comments as "harshly" aimed at Mueller's dismissal. Trump's personal lawyer John Dowd was accused of doing the president a "disservice" by urging the Justice Department to end the Russia collusion investigation. Fellow Republicans also criticized Trump's firing of Andrew McCabe, with Senator Marco Rubio saying it was done in a way that was "not right". Trump's tweets about McCabe were called "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false" by McCabe's lawyer. END OF SUMMARY.
