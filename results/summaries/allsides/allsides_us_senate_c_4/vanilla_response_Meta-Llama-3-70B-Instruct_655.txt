SUMMARY:

Republican senators have warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Trump has renewed his attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe on Twitter, sparking concerns that he may try to dismiss Mueller. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham have spoken out against such a move, with Graham saying it would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House has denied that Trump is considering firing Mueller. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, has called for an end to the investigation, but Republican Representative Trey Gowdy has criticized Dowd's comments. The Republican senators' comments highlight the risks for Trump if he tries to thwart the federal probe. The investigation has already led to the firing of FBI officials, including Andrew McCabe, who was dismissed two days before he was eligible to retire with a full pension.
