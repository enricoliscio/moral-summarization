SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and any potential collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump has intensified his attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe following the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who claimed he was targeted for corroborating claims that Trump tried to pressure the FBI into killing the Russia investigation. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham warned that firing Mueller would be disastrous for Trump's presidency, while other Republicans urged the president to let Mueller do his job without interference. The White House denied that Trump was considering firing Mueller, but the president's frustration with the ongoing probe was evident in his tweets accusing the FBI of lies, corruption, and leaking information. Trump's personal lawyer called for an end to the "manufactured" Russia collusion investigation, drawing criticism from some Republicans who defended Mueller's probe. The firing of McCabe also drew criticism from Republicans, who questioned the timing and justification of the decision. McCabe's lawyer called Trump's attacks "defamatory" and accused him of corrupting the termination process.
END OF SUMMARY.
