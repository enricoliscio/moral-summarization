SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators do their job without interference. Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have sparked criticism, with Senator Jeff Flake saying the president's comments appear to be aimed at firing Mueller. Senator Lindsey Graham warned that dismissing Mueller would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, was criticized for urging the Justice Department to end the Russia collusion investigation, which was deemed "corrupt" and "politically motivated." The president's frustration with the probe's duration was seen as a sign of growing desperation, with many Republicans calling for Mueller to be allowed to proceed without interference. Trump's actions were widely condemned, with his tweets about former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe being labeled "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false." END OF SUMMARY.
