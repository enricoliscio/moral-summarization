SUMMARY:

Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have renewed concerns about interference with the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham cautioned that firing Mueller would be a grave mistake, with Graham saying it would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." Trump's comments have been criticized as an attempt to thwart the probe, with Flake hoping it "doesn't go there." The president's attacks on former FBI officials James Comey and Andrew McCabe, who were involved in the Russia probe and subsequently fired, have been labeled as "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false" by McCabe's lawyer. The Republican comments underscore the risks for Trump if he goes too far to corrupt the investigation. Many Republicans share the view that Mueller should be allowed to proceed without interference, and that firing him would be unjustified.

END OF SUMMARY.
