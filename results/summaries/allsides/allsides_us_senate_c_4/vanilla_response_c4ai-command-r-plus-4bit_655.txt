SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering removing Mueller. The warnings came after Trump's recent attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, including the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Trump accused the FBI of lies, corruption, and leaking information, calling the Russia probe a witch hunt. Some Republicans criticized the firing of McCabe, who claimed he was targeted for corroborating claims that Trump tried to pressure the FBI director to end the Russia probe. Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, urged the Justice Department to end the investigation, drawing criticism from Republican Representative Trey Gowdy. White House legislative affairs director Marc Short stated that Trump was expressing frustration with the length of the Mueller investigation. Senator Graham emphasized the importance of allowing Mueller to proceed without interference.
END OF SUMMARY.
