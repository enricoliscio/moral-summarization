SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators do their job in probing Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have sparked concerns that he may try to dismiss Mueller, which would be "the beginning of the end of his presidency." Republican Senator Lindsey Graham warned that firing Mueller would be a corrupt move, and Senator Jeff Flake expressed hope that Trump wouldn't take such a "disastrous" step. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, was criticized for doing the president a disservice by urging the Justice Department to end the Russia collusion investigation. The president's tweets were labeled "childish, defamatory, disgusting, and false" by McCabe's lawyer. END OF SUMMARY.
