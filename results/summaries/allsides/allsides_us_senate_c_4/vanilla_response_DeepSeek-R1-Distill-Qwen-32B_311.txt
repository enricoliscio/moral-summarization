Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Republican senators warning President Trump not to fire Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel. They're concerned about the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

First, I should note the key points. Republican senators like Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham are urging Trump not to fire Mueller, saying it would be bad for his presidency. Flake mentions that Congress can't accept Mueller's firing. There's also a statement from the White House lawyer Ty Cobb denying that Trump is considering Mueller's removal.

The article mentions Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller, calling the probe a witch hunt. Trump's frustration with the investigation's duration is noted, and his lawyer Dowd is pushing for the probe to end. Some Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, support Mueller's independence, saying he should only be fired for cause, which they don't see.

Also, there's the firing of Andrew McCabe, with Trump and Sessions citing leaks and misleading information. McCabe's lawyer disputes these claims, calling Trump's tweets defamatory.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the warnings from senators, Trump's actions and statements, the White House denial, the support for Mueller, and the McCabe situation.

Let me structure it: Start with the senators' warnings, mention Trump's Twitter attacks, the White House denial, support for Mueller, and the McCabe firing and its implications.

I should make sure to keep it concise, covering all main points without going into too much detail. Also, ensure the summary flows logically from one point to the next.
