Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Republican senators warning President Trump not to fire Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel. They want him to let the federal investigators do their job regarding the Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Trump has been attacking the FBI and Mueller on Twitter, especially after firing Andrew McCabe. Flake and Graham are critical, saying firing Mueller would be bad for Trump's presidency. The White House denies considering Mueller's removal. Trump has been frustrated with the probe's length and called it a witch hunt. Some Republicans support Mueller, while others, like Dowd, suggest ending the investigation. McCabe's firing is also a point of contention, with Rubio and others criticizing the timing and process. McCabe's lawyer defends him against Trump's claims.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on key points: Republican senators' warnings, Trump's Twitter attacks, Flake and Graham's comments, White House denial, Trump's frustration, support for Mueller, McCabe's firing, and the criticism around it. Make sure it's concise and captures all main elements without getting too detailed.
