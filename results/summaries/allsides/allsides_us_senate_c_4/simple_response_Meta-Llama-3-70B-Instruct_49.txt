SUMMARY:

Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators probe Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have sparked concerns that he may try to dismiss Mueller. Republican Senator Jeff Flake said Trump's comments appear to be aimed at firing Mueller, while Senator Lindsey Graham warned that doing so would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House has denied that Trump is considering firing Mueller. Trump's actions have been widely criticized, with many Republicans urging him to let the investigation proceed without interference. The moral imperative is clear: Trump must respect the rule of law and allow the investigation to reach its conclusion. Firing Mueller would be a grave mistake, undermining the integrity of the justice system and eroding trust in government.
