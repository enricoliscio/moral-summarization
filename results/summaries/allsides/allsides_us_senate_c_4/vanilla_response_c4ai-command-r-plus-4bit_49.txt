SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. The warning came after Trump's recent attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe following the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump was considering dismissing Mueller. Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, called for the end of the Russia investigation, drawing criticism from Republican Representative Trey Gowdy. Meanwhile, Trump's legislative affairs director, Marc Short, attributed Trump's comments to his frustration with the duration of the Mueller investigation. Senator Marco Rubio also criticized the firing of McCabe, suggesting that the decision was made prematurely. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, denounced Trump's tweets as "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false."
