SUMMARY:
Republican senators warned President Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing that he must let federal investigators do their job without interference. Trump's Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have sparked concerns that he might try to thwart the investigation. Senator Jeff Flake criticized Trump's comments as "harshly" aimed at Mueller's firing, while Senator Lindsey Graham warned that dismissing Mueller would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, was accused of doing the president a "disservice" by urging the Justice Department to end the Russia probe. Republican lawmakers, including Trey Gowdy and Marco Rubio, expressed criticism over Trump's actions, with Rubio saying the firing of Andrew McCabe was "targeted" and "misleading." Trump's tweets were called "childish, defamatory, disgusting, and false" by McCabe's lawyer. END OF SUMMARY.
