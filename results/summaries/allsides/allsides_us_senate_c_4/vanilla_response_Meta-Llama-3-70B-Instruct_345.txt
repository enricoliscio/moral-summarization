SUMMARY:

Republican senators have warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Trump has renewed his Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, leading to concerns that he may try to dismiss Mueller. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham have spoken out against such a move, with Graham saying it would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency." The White House has denied that Trump is considering firing Mueller. Trump has also attacked former FBI officials, including James Comey and Andrew McCabe, who were involved in the Russia probe and were subsequently fired. Republicans have urged Trump to let the investigation proceed without interference, with some criticizing his personal lawyer's comments on the probe. The president's frustration with the length of the investigation has been cited as a reason for his recent tweets.
