Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral implications. The article is about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, the special counsel. They're emphasizing the importance of letting the investigation proceed without interference. There's a lot of tension here between the president and the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

I notice that the article uses words like "warning," "firing," "probe," "attack," "corruption," "witch hunt," and "frustration." These words carry moral weight because they imply accusations, interference, and potential wrongdoing. The senators are concerned about the integrity of the investigation and the potential consequences if Trump fires Mueller. They're framing this as a critical issue for the presidency and the rule of law.

I should make sure to include these morally framed words in the summary. Also, the summary needs to be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by identifying the main points: Trump's threats against Mueller, the senators' warnings, the risks for Trump if he fires Mueller, and the ongoing investigation into Russian interference.

I need to structure the summary to highlight the moral concerns without getting bogged down in too much detail. It's important to show the tension between Trump and the investigation, the potential consequences, and the bipartisan support for Mueller's probe.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key morally framed words and maintain the original framing's tone and implications.

**SUMMARY:**
Republican senators have cautioned President Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the need for federal investigators to proceed without interference in the probe into Russian election meddling. Trump's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller, following the firing of Andrew McCabe, have raised concerns about potential interference. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham warn that firing Mueller could signal the "end of Trump's presidency" and stress the importance of allowing the investigation to continue without obstruction. Despite White House claims that Trump is not considering Mueller's removal, Flake expressed hope that Congress would prevent such a move. Trump has criticized the investigation as a politically motivated "witch hunt," while his attorney, John Dowd, has called for its end. However, Republican Representative Trey Gowdy criticized Dowd's framing, urging a fair investigation. Trump's frustration with the probe's duration is evident, yet White House officials insist the administration is cooperating fully. The firing of McCabe, who was targeted for corroborating claims of Trump's pressure to halt the investigation, has drawn criticism from Rubio and others, who question the timing and integrity of the decision. END OF SUMMARY.
