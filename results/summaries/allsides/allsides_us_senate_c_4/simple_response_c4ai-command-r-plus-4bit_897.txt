SUMMARY: Republican senators have warned President Donald Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that such an action would be detrimental to Trump's presidency, while Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's spokeswoman affirmed the importance of letting Mueller do his job. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump intended to fire Mueller, but the president's recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe have raised concerns among Republicans. Senator Graham emphasized that Mueller should be allowed to proceed without interference, and Representative Trey Gowdy criticized Trump's lawyer for framing the investigation negatively. The firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe and Trump's frustration with the Mueller probe have added to the tension. Senator Marco Rubio also criticized McCabe's dismissal, highlighting the decision's timing. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called Trump's tweets "childish and defamatory." The situation underscores the ethical dilemma faced by Republicans in supporting or opposing Trump's actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
