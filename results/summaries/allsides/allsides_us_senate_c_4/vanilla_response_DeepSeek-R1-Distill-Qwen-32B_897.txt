Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want a news summary. The article is about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, and the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. I need to summarize this article in under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Republican senators like Flake and Graham are cautioning Trump against firing Mueller. They believe this would be bad for Trump's presidency. The White House has denied considering Mueller's removal, but Trump's recent tweets attacking the FBI and Mueller's probe are causing concern.

I should mention Trump's frustration with the investigation's duration and his claims about the probe being politically motivated. Also, the firing of McCabe and the criticism from Rubio and others about the timing and justification for his dismissal. Additionally, the support from Congress for Mueller to continue without interference is important.

I need to condense all these points into a concise summary. I'll start by stating the Republican senators' warnings, then mention Trump's attacks and the White House's denial. Next, I'll cover the concerns about Trump's actions, the firing of McCabe, and the congressional support for Mueller. Finally, I'll note the criticism of Trump's handling of the situation.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key aspects without exceeding the word limit. Let me structure it step by step to ensure clarity and completeness.
