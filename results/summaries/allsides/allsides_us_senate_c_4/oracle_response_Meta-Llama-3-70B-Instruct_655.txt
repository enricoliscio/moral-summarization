SUMMARY:

Republican senators warned President Donald Trump not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as Trump renewed his Twitter attacks on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mueller's probe. The president's comments appeared to be aimed at dismissing Mueller, which would mark "the beginning of the end of his presidency," according to Senator Lindsey Graham. Trump's attacks on the FBI leadership, including fired officials James Comey and Andrew McCabe, were seen as an attempt to thwart the federal probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Moscow conducted an influence campaign aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election to Trump. Mueller is investigating the Russian meddling and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Republican lawmakers urged Trump to let Mueller do his job without interference, warning that firing him would have severe consequences. Trump's actions were seen as an attempt to pressure and kill the Russia probe, with his lawyer's comments being criticized as "childish, defamatory, disgusting & false."

END OF SUMMARY.
