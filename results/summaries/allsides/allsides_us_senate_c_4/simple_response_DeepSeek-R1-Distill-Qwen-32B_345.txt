Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article, and I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and ends with the specified tokens. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Republican senators warning Trump not to fire Mueller, the special counsel. They're concerned about the integrity of the Russia investigation. Trump is attacking the FBI and Mueller, and there's tension between him and Congress.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The senators are emphasizing the importance of letting the investigation proceed without interference, which is a moral stance against obstructing justice. Trump's actions are portrayed as undermining the rule of law.

I should include key points: senators warning Trump, the potential consequences if Trump fires Mueller, Trump's frustration with the probe's duration, and the criticism from Republicans. Also, mention the firing of McCabe and the claims about leaks and corruption.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the main actors and their positions. Make sure to note the bipartisan concern and the risks for Trump's presidency.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to show the conflict between Trump's actions and the congressional stance, highlighting the moral implications of interfering with the investigation.

SUMMARY: Republican senators have cautioned President Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, emphasizing the need for federal investigators to complete their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump’s recent Twitter attacks on the FBI and Mueller, following the firing of Andrew McCabe, have raised concerns about potential obstruction of justice. Senator Jeff Flake warned that targeting Mueller could lead to political fallout, while Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would signal the “beginning of the end” of Trump’s presidency. Despite White House claims that Trump is not considering Mueller’s removal, Flake expressed hope that Congress would resist any such move. Trump has criticized the Russia investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt, while his lawyer, John Dowd, has called for the probe to end. However, Republican Representative Trey Gowdy criticized Dowd’s framing, urging respect for the investigative process. Trump’s frustration with the probe’s duration has been acknowledged, but Graham and others stress that Mueller must continue his work without interference. The firing of McCabe, who was accused of leaking information, has also drawn criticism, with Rubio and others questioning the timing and justification. Trump’s actions have sparked bipartisan concern over the integrity of the investigation and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
