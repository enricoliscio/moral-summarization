SUMMARY: Republican senators warned President Donald Trump against firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Senators Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham stated that firing Mueller would be detrimental to Trump's presidency. White House lawyer Ty Cobb denied that Trump intended to fire Mueller, but Trump continued his attacks on the FBI and Mueller's probe, calling it a "witch hunt." Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, urged the Justice Department to end the investigation, drawing criticism from Republican Representative Trey Gowdy. Trump's frustration with the probe's duration was noted by White House legislative affairs director Marc Short. Graham emphasized the importance of allowing Mueller to proceed without interference, a view shared by many Republicans. The firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, two days before his pension eligibility, also sparked criticism from Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio. McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called Trump's tweets "childish and defamatory."
END OF SUMMARY.
