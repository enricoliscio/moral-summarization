SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, ruling that the states had no reasonable basis for forbidding same-sex marriage. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, stated that the only rationale presented by the states was "full of holes" and could not be taken seriously. The judge argued that the bans were harmful to the welfare of American children, particularly those adopted by homosexual couples who would be better off if their parents were married. Posner rejected the states' claims that traditional marriage was the solution to accidental pregnancies, citing empirical data that showed out-of-wedlock births had increased despite the bans. He also struck down the argument that the ban helped to foster a centuries-old tradition of marriage, stating that "tradition cannot be a lawful ground for discrimination." The ruling is a significant blow to discrimination against same-sex couples, and the case is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
