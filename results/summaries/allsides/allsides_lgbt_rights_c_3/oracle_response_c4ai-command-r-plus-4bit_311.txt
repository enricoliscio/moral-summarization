SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court decision to do so. Writing for the unanimous panel, Judge Richard Posner rejected the states' arguments and claimed that there was "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage. He framed the issue at its "deepest level" as being about the welfare of American children, arguing that many children born outside of marriage are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents being able to marry. Posner also dismissed the states' appeals to tradition, stating that "tradition cannot be a lawful ground for discrimination." This decision, along with similar rulings from the 10th and 4th Circuit Courts, is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The summary highlights the moral framing of the original article, using words like "struck," "welfare," "discrimination," and "ban."

END OF SUMMARY.
