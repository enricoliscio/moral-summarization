SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Writing for the unanimous panel, Judge Richard Posner rejected the states' arguments, stating they had provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage. Posner highlighted the welfare of children as a key issue, arguing that many children born outside of marriage are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents being able to marry. He also dismissed the states' claims about "tradition", stating that distress over same-sex marriage is not enough to justify its ban. This decision adds to similar rulings by the 10th and 4th Circuit Courts, and the case is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The striking down of these bans highlights the ongoing struggle for equality and the removal of discrimination against same-sex couples, with Judge Posner's scathing opinion a strong statement against the denial of their right to marry.
END OF SUMMARY.
