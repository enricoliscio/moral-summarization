SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing no reasonable basis for the bans. Judge Richard Posner's unanimous opinion scathingly rejected the states' arguments, saying they were "full of holes" and couldn't be taken seriously. The states' main argument, that they seek to encourage marriage between a man and a woman to protect children from accidental pregnancies, was dismissed as discriminatory. Posner noted that many children are adopted by homosexual couples, who would be better off if their adoptive parents were married. The opinion struck a moral tone, highlighting the welfare of American children and the denial of rights to same-sex couples. The judges also rejected the states' claim that traditional marriage should be preserved, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down interracial marriage bans. The ruling is a significant blow to discrimination, paving the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to take on the issue.
