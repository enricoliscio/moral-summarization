SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. In a unanimous decision, Judge Richard Posner wrote that the states had no reasonable basis for forbidding same-sex marriage, and their arguments were "full of holes." The court rejected the states' claims that banning same-sex marriage encouraged heterosexual couples to marry and reduce accidental pregnancies, pointing out that many children of accidental pregnancies are adopted by same-sex couples who would benefit from marriage. The court also rejected the argument that tradition justified the ban, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down bans on interracial marriage. The decision is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is likely to take up the issue before the end of its current term in June.

END OF SUMMARY.
