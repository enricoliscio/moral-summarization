SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote that the states' arguments were "full of holes" and couldn't be taken seriously. The judge argued that the bans were discriminatory, denying same-sex couples the right to marry and abandoning children to single parents or foster care. Posner also rejected the states' claim that traditional marriage between a man and a woman was the solution to accidental pregnancies, citing empirical data that showed out-of-wedlock births had increased despite the bans. The judge concluded that "tradition cannot be a lawful ground for discrimination" and that mere distress over same-sex marriage was not enough to justify the ban. The ruling marks the third federal appeals court to strike down gay-marriage bans, with all three cases being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
