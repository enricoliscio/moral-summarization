SUMMARY:
A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal ruling of its kind and intensifying the moral debate surrounding marriage equality. Judge Richard Posner's scathing opinion highlights the "holes" in the states' arguments, asserting that there is "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage. He challenges the states' claims that such bans encourage heterosexual marriage and protect children born outside of marriage, arguing that homosexual couples often adopt these children and provide stable, loving homes. Posner dismisses the notion that "conventional marriage" solves the issue of accidental pregnancies, citing empirical data showing an increase in out-of-wedlock births despite such bans. Furthermore, he rejects the appeal to tradition, stating that "distress" over same-sex marriage is not a valid reason for discrimination. The case adds to a growing body of legal challenges to discriminatory laws, with the Supreme Court expected to make a final decision on the issue by June.
