SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage and that the argument put forth by the states was "full of holes." This decision aligns with similar rulings by the 10th and 4th Circuit Courts of Appeals. The case is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Posner's opinion emphasized the welfare of children and criticized the states' arguments, stating that gay couples are often better suited to provide stable homes for children of accidental pregnancies. Posner also dismissed the states' argument about preserving the tradition of marriage between a man and a woman, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling against bans on interracial marriage. The summary concludes by noting the judges who joined Posner's opinion.
END OF SUMMARY.
