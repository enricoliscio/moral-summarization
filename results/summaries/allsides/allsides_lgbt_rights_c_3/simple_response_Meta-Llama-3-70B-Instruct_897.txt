SUMMARY:

In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the prohibition. Judge Richard Posner's scathing opinion highlighted the flawed arguments presented by the states, which he deemed "full of holes" and "cannot be taken seriously." The states' central argument, that banning same-sex marriage encourages heterosexual couples to marry and care for their biological children, was dismissed as illogical and discriminatory. Posner pointed out that many children are adopted by homosexual couples, who would benefit emotionally and economically from marriage. He also rejected the states' claims that traditional marriage is a centuries-old institution, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down interracial marriage bans. The ruling, which joins similar decisions by two other federal appeals courts, is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
