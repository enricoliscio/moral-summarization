SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote that these states provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage and that the argument put forth by the states was "full of holes." This decision adds to similar rulings by the 10th Circuit and the 4th Circuit, with all three cases being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Posner's opinion emphasized the welfare of children and refuted states' arguments about accidental pregnancies and heterosexual marriage incentives. He also dismissed the argument of preserving the tradition of marriage between a man and a woman, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision against interracial marriage bans. Posner's tone was scathing, highlighting the illogical nature of the states' positions. The summary judgment concluded that distress over same-sex marriage was insufficient justification for banning it.
