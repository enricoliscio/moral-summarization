SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner's scathing opinion highlighted the flawed arguments presented by the states, which were based on encouraging marriage between men and women to protect children from accidental pregnancies. However, Posner noted that many of these children are adopted by homosexual couples, who would benefit from marriage. The judge also rejected the states' claims that traditional marriage should be preserved, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down interracial marriage bans. Posner's opinion was unanimous, and the case will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision is a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights, emphasizing that mere distress or tradition cannot justify discrimination. The court's ruling sends a strong message: all families, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal protection and recognition under the law.
