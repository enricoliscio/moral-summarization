SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. The unanimous three-judge panel, led by Judge Richard Posner, ruled that the states had no reasonable basis for forbidding same-sex marriage. The judges rejected the states' arguments that banning same-sex marriage encouraged heterosexual couples to marry and reduce accidental pregnancies, pointing out that many children of accidental pregnancies are adopted by same-sex couples who would benefit from marriage. The court also dismissed the states' claims that traditional marriage is a centuries-old institution, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down interracial marriage bans. The ruling is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is likely to take up the issue before the end of its current term in June.
