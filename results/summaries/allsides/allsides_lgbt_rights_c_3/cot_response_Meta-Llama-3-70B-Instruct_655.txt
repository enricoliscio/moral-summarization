SUMMARY:
The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner wrote that the states' arguments were "full of holes" and "cannot be taken seriously." The court rejected the states' claims that same-sex marriage would harm children, pointing out that many children are adopted by homosexual couples and would be "better off" if their parents were married. Posner also criticized the states' argument that straight couples need to be "pressured" into marriage, while gay couples are "model parents" who don't need marriage. The court's decision is a significant step towards ending discrimination against same-sex couples. The case will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to take on the issue before the end of its current term. END OF SUMMARY.
