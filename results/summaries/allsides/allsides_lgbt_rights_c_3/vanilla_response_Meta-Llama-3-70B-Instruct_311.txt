SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. The unanimous three-judge panel, led by Judge Richard Posner, ruled that the states had no reasonable basis for forbidding same-sex marriage. The judges rejected the states' arguments that same-sex marriage would lead to accidental pregnancies and that it would undermine the traditional institution of marriage. Posner wrote that the states' position was "full of holes" and that many children adopted by same-sex couples would benefit from their parents being married. The ruling is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is likely to take on the issue before the end of its current term in June. The 10th Circuit and 4th Circuit have also struck down same-sex marriage bans in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia.
