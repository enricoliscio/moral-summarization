SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. The ruling was written by Judge Richard Posner, who stated that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage. Posner's opinion highlighted the welfare of children as a key factor in the decision, noting that many children born out of accidental pregnancies are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their adoptive parents being married. He also rejected the states' arguments based on tradition and accidental pregnancies, citing increasing out-of-wedlock birth rates despite gay marriage bans. Posner's scathing opinion dismissed the states' rationale as "full of holes" and concluded that distress over same-sex marriage is not a valid justification for banning it. This decision adds to similar rulings by two other federal appeals courts, with all three cases expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
