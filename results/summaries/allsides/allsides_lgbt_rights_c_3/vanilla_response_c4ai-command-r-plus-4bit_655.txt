SUMMARY: In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage and that the welfare of children was a key factor in the decision. Posner highlighted the hypocrisy in the states' arguments, noting that homosexual couples are often better suited to provide stable homes for children born from accidental pregnancies. He also dismissed the states' defense of tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling against bans on interracial marriage. The decision adds to a growing body of legal precedent in favor of same-sex marriage and is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
