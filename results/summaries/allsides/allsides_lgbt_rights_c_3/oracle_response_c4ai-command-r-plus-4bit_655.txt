SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. The court found no reasonable basis for forbidding same-sex marriage and rejected the states' arguments, including those based on "tradition" and "accidental pregnancies." Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, framed the decision as being about the "welfare of American children," highlighting the hypocrisy in the states' arguments and noting that many children born outside of marriage are adopted by homosexual couples who would benefit from the right to marry. Posner's opinion was scathing towards the states' positions, exposing their flawed logic and discriminatory nature. This decision adds to a growing movement to strike down same-sex marriage bans across the country, with similar rulings in the 10th and 4th Circuit Courts and an expected review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The summary of this article highlights the moral framing of the original text, including words such as "strike," "struck," "welfare," "abandoned," "denied," "striking," "discrimination," and "ban."
END OF SUMMARY.
