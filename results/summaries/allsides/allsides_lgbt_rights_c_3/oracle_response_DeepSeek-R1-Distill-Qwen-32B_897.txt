Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing, so I should focus on the words like strike, struck, welfare, abandoned, denied, striking, discrimination, and ban.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The court ruled against the bans, saying the states didn't provide a reasonable basis. The judges emphasized the welfare of children and criticized the states' arguments about marriage encouraging stable families. They also mentioned how the bans discriminately denied rights to same-sex couples. The article also notes that these cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key morally charged words. I'll start by stating the court's decision, using "strike" and "bans." Then, mention the lack of reasonable basis and the focus on children's welfare. I'll include the criticism of the states' arguments, using "abandoned" and "discrimination." Also, note the comparison to interracial marriage and the mention of the Supreme Court appeal.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me draft a few sentences, ensuring all the moral terms are included without making it too lengthy. I'll check that the summary captures the essence of the court's reasoning and the moral implications highlighted in the article.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, found no reasonable basis for the bans, calling the states' arguments "full of holes." The court emphasized the welfare of American children, rejecting claims that same-sex couples are less fit parents. Posner criticized the states' logic, noting that denying marriage to same-sex couples discriminates against them while rewarding heterosexual couples for accidental pregnancies. He also pointed out that the out-of-wedlock birth rate has risen since the bans were enacted, undercutting the states' claims. The court rejected the idea that tradition alone justifies discrimination, referencing the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling on interracial marriage. The cases are now headed to the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
