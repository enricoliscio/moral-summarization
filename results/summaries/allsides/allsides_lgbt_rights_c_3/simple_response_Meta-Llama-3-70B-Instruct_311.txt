SUMMARY:

A federal appeals court has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the prohibitions. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote that the states' arguments were "full of holes" and couldn't be taken seriously. The court rejected the states' claims that same-sex marriage would harm children, pointing out that many children are adopted by homosexual couples who would benefit from marriage. Posner also criticized the states' argument that straight couples need to be "pressured" into marriage to prevent unwanted pregnancies, while gay couples are denied marriage despite being "model parents." The court also rejected the states' claims that traditional marriage is a centuries-old institution, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down bans on interracial marriage. The ruling is a significant blow to same-sex marriage bans, and the case is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
