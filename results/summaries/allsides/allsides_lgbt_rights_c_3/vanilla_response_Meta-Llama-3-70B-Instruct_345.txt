SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner wrote that the states had no reasonable basis for forbidding same-sex marriage, and their arguments were "full of holes" and couldn't be taken seriously. The court rejected the states' claims that same-sex marriage would harm children, noting that many children are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents' marriage. The court also dismissed the states' argument that traditional marriage should be preserved, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down a ban on interracial marriage. The ruling is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to take on the issue before the end of its current term in June. The decision is a significant step forward for same-sex marriage advocates.
