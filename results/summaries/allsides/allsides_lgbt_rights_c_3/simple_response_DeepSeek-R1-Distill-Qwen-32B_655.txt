Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article mentions that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down the bans, making it the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote the opinion, stating that the states provided no reasonable basis for the bans. He criticized the states' arguments, particularly about the welfare of children, pointing out that many children are adopted by same-sex couples and would benefit from their parents being married. He also noted that the argument about traditional marriage doesn't hold up, referencing the Supreme Court's decision on interracial marriage.

Posner also mentioned that the out-of-wedlock birth rates have increased since the bans were enacted, which undermines the states' claims. He criticized the states' reasoning as discriminatory and illogical, comparing it to rewarding heterosexual couples for producing unwanted children by allowing them to marry, while denying the same right to same-sex couples who don't have that issue.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: the court's decision, Posner's criticism of the states' arguments, the impact on children, the increase in out-of-wedlock births, and the comparison to interracial marriage. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral tone from the original article.

Let me structure this: start with the court's decision, mention Posner's reasoning, then the arguments about children, the statistical data, and the moral stance against discrimination. Make sure it flows logically and covers all key moral points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, joining two other federal appeals courts in ruling such bans unconstitutional. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote the unanimous opinion, stating the states provided "no reasonable basis" for the bans. He criticized the argument that traditional marriage protects children, noting many children adopted by same-sex couples would benefit from their parents being married. Posner also rejected the claim that tradition justifies discrimination, referencing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision on interracial marriage. He pointed out that out-of-wedlock birth rates have risen since the bans were enacted, undermining the states' claims. Posner called the reasoning "illogical," comparing it to rewarding heterosexual couples for producing unwanted children while denying marriage rights to same-sex couples. The decision emphasizes that mere distress over same-sex marriage is insufficient to justify bans. END OF SUMMARY.
