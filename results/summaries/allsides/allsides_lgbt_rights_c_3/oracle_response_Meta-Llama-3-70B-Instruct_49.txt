SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the prohibitions. Judge Richard Posner's unanimous opinion condemned the states' arguments as "full of holes" and "cannot be taken seriously." The states' central argument, that banning same-sex marriage encourages heterosexual couples to marry and care for their biological children, was dismissed as flawed. Posner noted that many children are adopted by homosexual couples, who would be better off if their adoptive parents were married. The opinion scathingly rejected the states' position, calling it "discrimination" and highlighting the contradiction that heterosexual couples are "rewarded" with marriage for producing unwanted children, while homosexual couples are denied marriage despite being "model parents." The court's decision marks the third federal appeals court to strike down gay-marriage bans, paving the way for a potential Supreme Court review. END OF SUMMARY.
