Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about an Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. The court, led by Judge Posner, ruled that the states didn't provide a reasonable basis for the bans. He criticized the states' arguments, especially regarding the welfare of children and the tradition of marriage. Posner pointed out that the states' reasoning was full of holes and that their policies weren't effective, as shown by increasing out-of-wedlock birth rates. He also compared this to the interracial marriage case, emphasizing that tradition can't justify discrimination.

Now, I need to make sure I include the moral words: strike, struck, welfare, abandoned, denied, striking, discrimination, ban. I should structure the summary to highlight the court's actions against the bans, the reasoning, and the moral implications. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, ruled that the states provided no reasonable basis for the bans, calling their arguments "full of holes." He emphasized that the cases centered on the welfare of American children, rejecting the states' claim that traditional marriage discourages accidental pregnancies. Posner noted that out-of-wedlock birth rates have risen since the bans were enacted, undermining the states' rationale. He also criticized the idea that tradition justifies discrimination, referencing the 1967 Supreme Court decision on interracial marriage. The court's decision highlights the moral inconsistency of denying marriage rights to same-sex couples while rewarding heterosexual couples for producing children. The cases are now headed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule before June. END OF SUMMARY.
