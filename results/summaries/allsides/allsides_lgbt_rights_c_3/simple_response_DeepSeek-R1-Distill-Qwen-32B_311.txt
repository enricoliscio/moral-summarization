Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article about the Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key arguments and the court's reasoning.

First, the article mentions that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest struck down the bans, making it the third federal court to do so. Judge Posner wrote the opinion, calling the states' rationales "full of holes." I should note that he's a Reagan appointee, which adds context about his background.

The main arguments from the states were about encouraging heterosexual marriage to protect children from accidental pregnancies. Posner criticized this, pointing out that many children are adopted by same-sex couples and would benefit from their parents being married. He also mocked the idea that heterosexuals are irresponsible and need marriage incentives, while homosexuals are model parents who don't need it. That's a strong moral critique against the states' reasoning.

Posner also cited statistics showing an increase in out-of-wedlock births despite the bans, which undermines the states' argument. Additionally, he referenced the Supreme Court's decision on interracial marriage, stating that tradition can't justify discrimination. He acknowledged people's distress but said that alone isn't enough to ban same-sex marriage.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: the court's decision, Posner's criticism of the states' arguments, the statistics, the comparison to interracial marriage, and the conclusion that tradition isn't a lawful basis for discrimination. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, starting with the court's action, then the reasoning, and ending with the implications.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it concise. Also, the summary should flow logically, highlighting the moral and legal arguments presented by the court. I'll make sure to mention that the cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court, which adds context about the next steps in this legal battle.

Let me put this together step by step, ensuring each key point is included without going over the word limit. I'll start with the court's decision, then the judge's reasoning, the critique of the states' arguments, the statistical evidence, the reference to interracial marriage, and the conclusion about tradition and distress. That should cover the main moral and legal points the author emphasized.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, joining two other federal appeals courts in ruling such bans unconstitutional. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote the opinion, calling the states' rationales "full of holes" and lacking a "reasonable basis." The states argued that same-sex marriage bans encourage heterosexual marriage to protect children from accidental pregnancies, but Posner criticized this, noting that many children adopted by same-sex couples would benefit from their parents being married. He also mocked the idea that heterosexuals are irresponsible and need marriage incentives, while homosexuals are model parents who don't. Posner cited statistics showing an increase in out-of-wedlock births despite the bans, and compared the issue to the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down interracial marriage bans, stating that tradition cannot justify discrimination. He acknowledged people's distress over same-sex marriage but said it alone doesn't justify the ban. The cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to decide before June. END OF SUMMARY.
