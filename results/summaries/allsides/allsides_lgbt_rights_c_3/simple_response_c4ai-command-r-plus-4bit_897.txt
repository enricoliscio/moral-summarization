SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote a scathing opinion dismissing the states' arguments as baseless and discriminatory. Posner highlighted the welfare of children as a key issue, arguing that the states' rationale of encouraging heterosexual marriage to prevent accidental pregnancies was flawed and did not consider the benefits of adoption by same-sex couples. He also rejected the argument of preserving tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling against interracial marriage bans. Posner's opinion emphasized the unjustified distress caused by the ban on same-sex marriage and was joined by two other judges. This case, along with similar ones from the 10th and 4th Circuits, is expected to reach the Supreme Court soon.
END OF SUMMARY.
