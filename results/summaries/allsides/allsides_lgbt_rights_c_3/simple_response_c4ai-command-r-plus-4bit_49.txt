SUMMARY: In a landmark decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Writing for the unanimous panel, Judge Richard Posner refuted the states' arguments against same-sex marriage, stating they had "no reasonable basis" for forbidding it. Posner highlighted the welfare of children as the key issue, arguing that homosexual couples often adopt children conceived in heterosexual relationships and provide them with a stable family structure. He criticized the states' position of encouraging heterosexual marriage to prevent accidental pregnancies, pointing out the increasing rate of out-of-wedlock births. Posner also dismissed the argument of preserving the traditional definition of marriage, citing the Supreme Court's previous ruling against interracial marriage bans. The opinion emphasized the immorality of discriminating against same-sex couples based on mere distress or tradition. This decision adds to a growing momentum for marriage equality, with similar rulings in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia. The issue is expected to reach the Supreme Court, which may provide a definitive ruling on marriage equality across the nation.
