Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about an Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. It mentions that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest, a three-judge panel led by Judge Richard Posner, ruled that the states didn't provide a reasonable basis for the bans. 

Posner is a Reagan appointee, and the court found the states' arguments lacking. They compared this to similar rulings in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia, all of which are being appealed to the Supreme Court. The cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court before June. 

Posner emphasized the welfare of children, pointing out that the states' argument about encouraging heterosexual marriage to protect children from accidental pregnancies was flawed. He noted that many children are adopted by same-sex couples and would benefit from their parents being married. He criticized the states' reasoning as illogical and based on tradition, which he said isn't a lawful ground for discrimination. 

He also cited statistics showing an increase in out-of-wedlock births despite the bans, which undermines the states' argument. The judges on the panel included Clinton and Obama appointees, showing a bipartisan decision. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: the court's decision, the reasoning, the comparison to other cases, the impact on children, the critique of the states' arguments, and the mention of the Supreme Court appeal.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, joining two other federal appeals courts in ruling against such bans. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, found no reasonable basis for the bans and criticized the states' arguments as lacking credibility. The court emphasized the welfare of children, noting that many are adopted by same-sex couples and would benefit from their parents' marriage. Posner also rejected the states' reliance on tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 interracial marriage decision. He pointed out that out-of-wedlock birth rates have risen despite the bans, undermining the states' claims. The cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court before June. END OF SUMMARY.
