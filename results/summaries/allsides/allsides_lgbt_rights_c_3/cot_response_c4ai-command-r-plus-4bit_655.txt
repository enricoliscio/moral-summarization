SUMMARY:
In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Judge Richard Posner, writing for the panel, dismissed the states' arguments as baseless and morally indefensible. He highlighted the welfare of children as the core issue, noting that many children born out of wedlock are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents' legal marriage. Posner scathingly rebuked the states' claims about heterosexual couples being pressured to marry due to accidental pregnancies, calling it a reward for heterosexuals' sexual irresponsibility while denying the same right to homosexual couples who do not produce "unwanted" children. Posner also rejected the states' defense of tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling against interracial marriage bans. He acknowledged the distress of those opposed to same-sex marriage but asserted that it does not justify discrimination. The decision adds to a growing body of legal support for same-sex marriage rights, with three cases currently before the Supreme Court.
