Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about an Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. It mentions that this is the third federal court to do so. Judge Posner wrote the opinion, and he's a Reagan appointee. He found that the states didn't provide a reasonable basis for the bans.

Posner's argument revolves around the welfare of children. The states argued that promoting heterosexual marriage protects children from accidental pregnancies. But Posner counters by saying that many children are adopted by homosexual couples and would be better off if their parents could marry. He also points out that the out-of-wedlock birth rates have increased since the bans were enacted, which undermines the states' argument.

He also dismisses the tradition argument, referencing the Supreme Court's decision on interracial marriage. He argues that tradition can't justify discrimination. The summary should highlight the moral issues, like the impact on children and the states' flawed reasoning.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the court's decision, Posner's arguments about children's welfare, the states' failed reasoning, the tradition argument, and the comparison to interracial marriage. I'll make sure to capture the moral stance by emphasizing how the bans don't serve the children's best interests and are based on outdated traditions.

Let me structure it: start with the court's decision, then the reasoning about children, the states' flawed arguments, the tradition point, and conclude with the implications. That should cover the moral framing effectively without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, joining two other federal appeals courts in ruling such bans unconstitutional. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote the unanimous opinion, stating the states provided "no reasonable basis" for the bans. He criticized the argument that heterosexual marriage protects children from accidental pregnancies, noting that many children adopted by same-sex couples would benefit from their parents' ability to marry. Posner also rejected the claim that tradition justifies the bans, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision overturning interracial marriage bans. He emphasized that tradition cannot justify discrimination. The states' argument that promoting heterosexual marriage reduces out-of-wedlock births was undermined by rising rates since the bans were enacted. The cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule before June. Posner's opinion highlights the moral issue of denying marriage rights to same-sex couples while rewarding heterosexual couples for producing children, regardless of intent.  

END OF SUMMARY.
