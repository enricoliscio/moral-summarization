SUMMARY:
The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner's opinion was scathing, pointing out the "holes" in the states' arguments and concluding that they were "unreasonable" and "cannot be taken seriously." The states' claims that same-sex marriage would harm children were "overlooked" and "belied" by empirical data. Posner argued that many children adopted by homosexual couples would be "better off" if their parents were married. The states' position was deemed "discriminatory" and "unlawful," and their tradition-based argument was "rejected" as it "runs head on" into the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down a ban on interracial marriage. The court's decision is a significant step towards recognizing the "welfare" of all American children, regardless of their parents' sexual orientation. END OF SUMMARY.
