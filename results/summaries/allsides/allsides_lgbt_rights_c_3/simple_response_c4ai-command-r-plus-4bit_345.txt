SUMMARY: In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote a scathing opinion dismissing the states' arguments as baseless and morally bankrupt. He highlighted the hypocrisy and empirical inaccuracy of the states' claims that banning same-sex marriage promotes responsible procreation and benefits children, arguing instead that same-sex couples are often model parents who provide stable homes for children who might otherwise be abandoned. Posner also rejected the states' appeal to tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling against bans on interracial marriage. This decision adds to a growing body of jurisprudence recognizing the moral and legal imperative of marriage equality, with the Supreme Court expected to make a final ruling on the issue by June.
