SUMMARY: 
In a unanimous decision, a U.S. Court of Appeals covering the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Judge Richard Posner, writing for the three-judge panel, dismissed the states' arguments as baseless and "full of holes." The decision centers on the welfare of children, with Posner noting that many children born out of wedlock or given up for adoption are raised by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents being legally married. Posner scathingly rebuked the states' claims that heterosexual couples need to be incentivized to marry due to their sexual irresponsibility, while homosexual couples, who cannot have "accidental pregnancies," are denied the right to marry. He further highlighted the hypocrisy in the states' attempts to uphold a centuries-old tradition of heterosexual marriage, pointing to the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling against interracial marriage bans. Posner acknowledged the distress same-sex marriage may cause some, but affirmed that this does not justify discrimination. This ruling adds to a growing body of legal decisions affirming the rights of same-sex couples, with similar cases from the 10th and 4th Circuits currently being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
