SUMMARY: In a unanimous decision, a federal appeals court has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote a scathing opinion rejecting the states' arguments in favor of the bans, stating that they had provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage. Posner highlighted the welfare of children as a key issue, arguing that many children born out of accidental pregnancies are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents being legally married. He also dismissed the states' reliance on tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision that struck down bans on interracial marriage. The decision is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which may take on the issue of same-sex marriage before the end of its current term. Posner's opinion is a powerful statement in favor of equality and the well-being of children, sending a strong message that discrimination based on tradition and prejudice is unacceptable and unconstitutional.
