SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the prohibition. Judge Richard Posner's scathing opinion highlighted the flawed arguments presented by the states, which he deemed "full of holes" and unable to be taken seriously. The states' claims that same-sex marriage would lead to more accidental pregnancies and abandoned children were debunked by Posner, who pointed out that many children are adopted by homosexual couples who would benefit from marriage. The judge also rejected the states' appeal to tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down interracial marriage bans. The ruling marks the third federal appeals court to strike down gay-marriage bans, paving the way for a likely Supreme Court decision on the issue. The moral imperative is clear: discrimination against same-sex couples is unjust and must be rectified.
