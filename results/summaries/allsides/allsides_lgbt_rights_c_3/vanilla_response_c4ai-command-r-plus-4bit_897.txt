SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. The decision was written by Judge Richard Posner, who stated that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage. Posner's opinion highlighted the welfare of children as a key factor, noting that many children born outside of marriage are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents being able to marry. He also dismissed the states' arguments about tradition and accidental pregnancies, citing increasing out-of-wedlock birth rates despite gay-marriage bans. This decision adds to similar rulings by the 10th and 4th Circuit Courts, and the case is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court by the end of its current term.
END OF SUMMARY.
