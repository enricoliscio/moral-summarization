SUMMARY: 
A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Writing for the unanimous decision, Judge Richard Posner dismissed the states' arguments against same-sex marriage as baseless and discriminatory. Posner highlighted the welfare of children as the core issue, refuting the claim that heterosexual marriage needed to be encouraged to protect children of accidental pregnancies. He noted that many such children are adopted by homosexual couples who provide better lives for them as married parents. Posner's scathing opinion exposed the illogical "reward" system of the states' position: heterosexual couples who produce unwanted children are "rewarded" with the right to marry, while homosexual couples, incapable of producing unwanted children, are "rewarded" with a denial of that right. Empirical data, he added, belies the states' claims about accidental pregnancies, and the tradition of heterosexual marriage cannot justify discrimination. The distress of some over same-sex marriage, Posner concluded, does not justify the ban. END OF SUMMARY.
