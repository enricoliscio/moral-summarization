SUMMARY:
The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, wrote that the states' argument is "full of holes" and cannot be taken seriously. The states' position is that heterosexuals are "sexually irresponsible" and need to be pressured into marriage, while gay couples are "model parents" who don't need marriage. Posner rejected the states' claim that traditional marriage is the solution to accidental pregnancies, citing empirical data that shows out-of-wedlock births have increased despite the ban. He also argued that "tradition cannot be a lawful ground for discrimination." The ruling is a significant step forward for the welfare of American children, particularly those adopted by same-sex couples who would be better off if their parents were married. END OF SUMMARY.
