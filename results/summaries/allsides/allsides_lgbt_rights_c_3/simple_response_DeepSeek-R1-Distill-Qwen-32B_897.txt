Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the U.S. Court of Appeals striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. The judge, Richard Posner, is a Reagan appointee, which is interesting because it shows that even conservative judges can rule in favor of same-sex marriage.

Posner's reasoning is that the states didn't provide a reasonable basis for the bans. He points out that the argument about protecting children from accidental pregnancies is flawed because the out-of-wedlock birth rates have actually increased since the bans were enacted. This is a key moral point because it challenges the state's justification for the ban, showing it's ineffective.

He also compares this to the interracial marriage case, emphasizing that tradition alone isn't a lawful reason for discrimination. This ties into the moral argument against discrimination based on tradition.

Posner's tone is scathing, highlighting the hypocrisy in the states' arguments. The moral framing here is about equality and justice, questioning why heterosexual couples get rewards through marriage while same-sex couples are denied it for not producing children.

I should include the statistics about the increasing birth rates to support the argument that the bans aren't working. Also, mention the comparison to interracial marriage to underline the discrimination aspect.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words, so I need to capture the main points: the court's decision, Posner's reasoning, the flawed arguments by the states, the statistical evidence, and the comparison to past discrimination cases.

I'll structure it by first stating the court's action, then Posner's rejection of the states' arguments, the statistical evidence, and the moral stance against discrimination based on tradition. I'll end by noting the expected appeal to the Supreme Court.

Making sure to highlight the moral elements like equality, justice, and the effectiveness of the state's policies. Also, including the part about children being better off with married same-sex parents adds another layer to the moral argument.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, ruled that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for the bans, dismissing their argument that traditional marriage protects children from accidental pregnancies. Posner noted that the out-of-wedlock birth rate has risen since the bans were enacted, undermining the states' claim. He also rejected the idea that tradition alone can justify discrimination, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision on interracial marriage. Posner emphasized that mere distress over same-sex marriage is insufficient to justify bans. The decision highlights the moral argument for equality and justice, questioning why heterosexual couples are "rewarded" with marriage while same-sex couples are denied it for not producing children. The cases are expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
