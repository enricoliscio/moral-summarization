SUMMARY:
The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing no "reasonable basis" for the prohibition. Judge Richard Posner's unanimous opinion scathingly dismissed the states' arguments, calling them "full of holes" and "not taken seriously." The states' claim that traditional marriage encourages responsible procreation was deemed "irresponsible" and "belied" by empirical data. Posner argued that many children would be "better off" if their adoptive homosexual parents were married, and that the ban on same-sex marriage is a form of "discrimination." The ruling is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which may take on the issue before the end of its current term. The court's decision is a significant step towards recognizing the "welfare" of American children and promoting a more "lawful" and inclusive society. END OF SUMMARY.
