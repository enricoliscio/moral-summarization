SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, stated that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage and that their arguments were "full of holes." The decision, along with similar rulings from the 10th and 4th Circuit Courts, is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. At its core, the case is about the welfare of American children, with states arguing that heterosexual marriage encourages stability for children of accidental pregnancies. However, Judge Posner highlighted the contributions of homosexual couples in adopting and providing loving homes for these children. He scathingly critiqued the states' position as rewarding irresponsible heterosexual couples who "get drunk and pregnant" with the right to marry, while denying the same right to homosexual couples who do not produce unwanted children. Judge Posner also rejected the states' appeal to tradition, stating that tradition cannot justify discrimination, no matter its age. This decision, joined by Judges Ann Claire Williams and David Hamilton, highlights the court's commitment to upholding the welfare of children and ending discrimination against same-sex couples.
END OF SUMMARY.
