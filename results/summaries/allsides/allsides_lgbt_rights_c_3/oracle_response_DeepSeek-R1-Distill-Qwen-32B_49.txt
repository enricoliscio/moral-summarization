Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The key terms to include are "strike," "struck," "welfare," "abandoned," "denied," "striking," "discrimination," and "ban." 

The article talks about the U.S. Court of Appeals striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. I should mention that this is the third federal appeals court to do so, following the 10th and 4th Circuits. The judge, Richard Posner, found no reasonable basis for the bans and criticized the states' arguments about marriage and child welfare.

Posner emphasized the welfare of children, pointing out that denying marriage to same-sex couples could leave children abandoned or in foster care. He also criticized the idea that heterosexual couples need marriage to prevent unwanted pregnancies, noting that the out-of-wedlock birth rates have increased despite the bans. He compared this to discrimination, similar to interracial marriage bans.

I need to make sure the summary includes all the morally charged words and reflects the court's rejection of the states' arguments as discriminatory and illogical. I'll structure the summary to first state the court's decision, then address the reasoning and criticism of the states' arguments, highlighting the moral issues involved.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, joining two other federal appeals courts in striking such bans. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, found no reasonable basis for the bans, calling the states' arguments "full of holes." He emphasized the welfare of American children, noting that denying marriage to same-sex couples could leave children abandoned or in foster care. Posner criticized the states' claim that heterosexual marriage prevents unwanted pregnancies, pointing to rising out-of-wedlock birth rates despite the bans. He also rejected the idea that tradition justifies discrimination, comparing it to interracial marriage bans. The court's decision highlights the moral issue of denying marriage rights to same-sex couples, arguing that mere distress over same-sex marriage is not enough to justify the ban. END OF SUMMARY.
