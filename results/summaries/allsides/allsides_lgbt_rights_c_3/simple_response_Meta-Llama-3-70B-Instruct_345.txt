SUMMARY:

In a landmark decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner's scathing opinion highlighted the flawed reasoning behind the states' arguments, which he deemed "full of holes" and "cannot be taken seriously." The states' claims that same-sex marriage would lead to more abandoned children and that heterosexual couples need to be pressured into marriage were debunked by Posner, who pointed out that many children are adopted by homosexual couples and would benefit from their parents' marriage. Posner also rejected the states' appeal to tradition, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down bans on interracial marriage. The ruling is a significant step towards marriage equality, and the case is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The unanimous decision sends a clear message: discrimination against same-sex couples is unjustifiable and harmful to children and families.

END OF SUMMARY.
