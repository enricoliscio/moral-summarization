SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. Writing for the unanimous panel, Judge Richard Posner rejected the states' arguments against same-sex marriage, stating that they provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding it. Posner highlighted the welfare of children as a key issue, arguing that the states' rationale of encouraging heterosexual marriage to prevent accidental pregnancies was flawed and unsupported by empirical data. He also dismissed the notion that tradition could justify discrimination, citing the Supreme Court's previous ruling on interracial marriage. Posner's opinion emphasized the inconsistent and discriminatory nature of the states' arguments, noting that heterosexual couples are rewarded for their irresponsible behavior while homosexual couples are denied the same rights despite being model parents. The ruling adds to a growing body of legal decisions recognizing the rights of same-sex couples, with the Supreme Court expected to take on the issue in the near future. END OF SUMMARY.
