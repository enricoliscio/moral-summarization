SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner wrote that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for the bans, and their arguments were "full of holes" and couldn't be taken seriously. The court rejected the states' claims that banning same-sex marriage encouraged heterosexual couples to marry and reduce accidental pregnancies, pointing out that many children of accidental pregnancies are adopted by same-sex couples who would benefit from marriage. The court also dismissed the argument that tradition justified the ban, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down bans on interracial marriage. The ruling is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to take on the issue before the end of its current term in June.
