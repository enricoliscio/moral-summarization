Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down the bans, making it the third federal appeals court to do so. The judges involved are Richard Posner, Ann Claire Williams, and David Hamilton. Posner wrote the opinion, and he's a Reagan appointee, which might be relevant for context.

Posner's argument is that the states didn't provide a reasonable basis for the bans. He criticizes the states' rationale, calling it full of holes. He mentions that the states argue that traditional marriage protects children from accidental pregnancies, but points out that many children are adopted by same-sex couples and would benefit from their parents being married. He also mocks the states' logic, comparing it to rewarding heterosexuals for producing unwanted children by allowing them to marry, while denying marriage to homosexuals who don't have that issue.

Posner also uses data showing that the out-of-wedlock birth rates have increased since the bans were enacted, which contradicts the states' claims that the bans help reduce such births. He further rejects the argument that tradition justifies the ban, referencing the Supreme Court's decision on interracial marriage.

The article mentions that this decision is part of a trend, with similar rulings in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia. All these cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court, which is expected to decide before June.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: the court's decision, the judges involved, Posner's main arguments against the states' rationales, the data on birth rates, the reference to tradition, and the context of other similar cases heading to the Supreme Court.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the court's action, then Posner's reasoning, the data, the tradition argument, and the broader context. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, criticized the states for failing to provide a reasonable basis for the bans. He argued that the states' rationale, which focused on protecting children from accidental pregnancies, was flawed, as many children adopted by same-sex couples would benefit from their parents being married. Posner also noted that out-of-wedlock birth rates have risen since the bans were enacted, contradicting the states' claims. He rejected the argument that tradition justifies the ban, referencing the Supreme Court's decision on interracial marriage. The cases, along with others from Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia, are being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to rule before June. END OF SUMMARY.
