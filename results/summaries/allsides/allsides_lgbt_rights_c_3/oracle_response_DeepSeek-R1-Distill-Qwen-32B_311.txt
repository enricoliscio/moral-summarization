Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included: strike, struck, welfare, abandoned, denied, striking, discrimination, ban. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The U.S. Court of Appeals struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. Judge Posner's opinion was key, emphasizing the lack of a reasonable basis for the bans. He criticized the states' arguments about marriage promoting child welfare, pointing out flaws in their reasoning. The states' claims about tradition and preventing unwanted pregnancies were dismissed as unsupported by data. The article mentions that the cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary. I'll start by stating the court's decision using "struck" and "ban." Then, I'll mention the judge's opinion, highlighting the "welfare" aspect and how the states' arguments were "denied." I'll include the striking down of the bans and the moral issues like discrimination and tradition. I should also note the data on out-of-wedlock births and the comparison to interracial marriage bans. Finally, I'll end with the appeal to the Supreme Court.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of the specified words as possible without forcing them. I'll structure it to flow logically, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is evident.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, found no reasonable basis for the bans, calling the states' arguments "so full of holes that they cannot be taken seriously." The decision emphasized the "welfare of American children," rejecting the states' claim that same-sex marriage bans encourage heterosexual marriage to protect children from accidental pregnancies. Posner noted that many children adopted by same-sex couples would be "better off" if their parents were married. He criticized the states' logic as discriminatory, comparing it to the outdated tradition of banning interracial marriage. Posner also highlighted data showing rising out-of-wedlock birth rates despite the bans, undermining the states' claims. The rulings, which strike down the bans, are being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
