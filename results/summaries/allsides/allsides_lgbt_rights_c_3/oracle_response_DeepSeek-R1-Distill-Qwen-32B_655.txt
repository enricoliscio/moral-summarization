Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should keep the morally charged words like "strike," "struck," "welfare," "abandoned," "denied," "striking," "discrimination," and "ban." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Appeals Court struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. Judge Posner led the decision, arguing the states didn't provide a reasonable basis. He criticized the states' reasoning, especially regarding children's welfare and the tradition argument. He also mentioned the increase in out-of-wedlock births despite the bans, and compared the situation to interracial marriage bans.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary. I'll start by stating the court's action, then mention Posner's main points: no reasonable basis, welfare argument flaws, empirical data on births, and the comparison to interracial marriage. I should include the morally framed words as much as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll make sure each point is clear and flows logically. Also, I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. Let me draft it and then review to ensure all key points are included and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, becoming the third federal appeals court to do so. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, criticized the states for failing to provide a "reasonable basis" for the bans, calling their arguments "full of holes." He emphasized that the cases centered on the "welfare of American children," rejecting the states' claim that traditional marriage protects children from accidental pregnancies. Posner noted that many children are adopted by same-sex couples, who would "better off" if allowed to marry. He also mocked the states' logic, stating that heterosexual couples are rewarded with marriage despite producing unwanted children, while gay couples, who cannot have biological children, are "denied" the right to marry. Posner rejected the argument that tradition justifies discrimination, referencing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision on interracial marriage. He pointed out that out-of-wedlock birth rates have risen since the bans were enacted, undermining the states' claims. The rulings are being appealed to the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
