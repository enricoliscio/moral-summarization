SUMMARY:

The U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing "no reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner's unanimous opinion rejected the states' arguments, calling them "full of holes" and "not taken seriously." The states' claims that banning same-sex marriage encourages responsible parenting and protects children are discriminatory and lack empirical evidence. In reality, many children adopted by homosexual couples would be better off if their parents were married. The opinion scathingly pointed out the hypocrisy of the states' position, which rewards heterosexuals for accidental pregnancies with marriage, while denying the same right to homosexual couples. The court also rejected the argument that the ban helps preserve a centuries-old tradition of marriage, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 decision striking down interracial marriage bans. Tradition cannot be a lawful ground for discrimination. The ruling is a significant step towards ending discrimination against same-sex couples. END OF SUMMARY.
