Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Appeals Court striking down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Midwest has become the third federal appeals court to strike down gay-marriage bans, specifically in Wisconsin and Indiana. The judge, Richard Posner, wrote the opinion, stating that the states provided no reasonable basis for the bans. He criticized their arguments, saying they were full of holes.

I should note that two other circuits, the 10th and 4th, have also struck down similar bans, and these cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court. Posner emphasized that the issue is about the welfare of children, arguing that the states' reasoning about marriage encouraging responsible parenthood is flawed. He pointed out that many children are adopted by same-sex couples and would benefit from their parents being married.

He also criticized the states' argument about tradition, referencing the Supreme Court's decision on interracial marriage. Posner noted that tradition alone can't justify discrimination. Additionally, he mentioned that the out-of-wedlock birth rates have increased since the bans were enacted, which undermines the states' claims.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should include the court's decision, the judge's main arguments, the other circuits, the appeal to the Supreme Court, and the key points about children's welfare and tradition.

Let me structure this: start with the court's action, mention Posner's reasoning, the other circuits, the appeal, and then the main arguments about children and tradition. Also, note the increase in out-of-wedlock births despite the bans.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and covers all these points without being too detailed. Maybe start with the Appeals Court decision, then the reasoning, the other cases, the Supreme Court appeal, and the critique of the states' arguments.

Wait, the user also provided an example response. Let me check that to ensure I'm on the right track. The example mentions the court striking down bans, the judge's reasoning, other circuits, the Supreme Court appeal, and the critique of the states' arguments. It also includes the tradition point and the out-of-wedlock statistics.

I think I have all the necessary elements. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all key points.
