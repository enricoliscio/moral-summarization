SUMMARY:
A federal appeals court has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, citing no "reasonable basis" for the bans. Judge Richard Posner wrote that the states' argument was "full of holes" and could not be taken "seriously." The court found that the bans were not about "protecting" children, but rather about discriminating against same-sex couples. Posner argued that many children adopted by homosexual couples would be "better off" if their parents were married. The states' claim that traditional marriage is the solution to accidental pregnancies was "belied" by empirical data, which showed an increase in out-of-wedlock births. The court rejected the states' argument that the ban helped to foster a centuries-old tradition of marriage, stating that "tradition cannot be a lawful ground for discrimination." The ruling is a significant step forward for same-sex marriage advocates, who argue that the ban is "unreasonable" and "discriminatory." END OF SUMMARY.
