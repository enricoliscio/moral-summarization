SUMMARY: A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down gay-marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third federal appeals court decision of its kind. Judge Richard Posner, writing for a unanimous panel, stated that the states provided "no reasonable basis" for forbidding same-sex marriage and that their arguments were "full of holes." The decision framed the issue at its "deepest level" as one of children's welfare, rejecting the states' claims that banning same-sex marriage encourages heterosexual marriage and protects children of accidental pregnancies. Judge Posner scathingly pointed out the flawed logic in rewarding heterosexual couples who "get drunk and pregnant" with the right to marry while denying the same right to homosexual couples who do not produce unwanted children. The court also dismissed the argument of preserving the tradition of marriage between a man and a woman, citing the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling against interracial marriage bans. This decision, along with similar appeals from the 10th and 4th Circuits, is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Posner's opinion emphasized the denial of rights and discrimination inherent in these bans, ultimately striking them down in favor of the welfare and equality of all couples and their children.
END OF SUMMARY.
