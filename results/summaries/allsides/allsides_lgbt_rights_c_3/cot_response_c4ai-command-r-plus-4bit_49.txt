SUMMARY:
A U.S. Court of Appeals has struck down same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana, marking the third such ruling by a federal appeals court. The decision was based on the argument that these bans lacked any reasonable basis and were discriminatory. Judge Posner's opinion emphasized the welfare of children, refuting states' claims that banning same-sex marriage encourages heterosexual marriage and protects children born outside of marriage. Posner highlighted the hypocrisy in rewarding heterosexual couples who produce unwanted children with the right to marry, while denying the same right to homosexual couples who do not produce unwanted children. He also dismissed the argument of preserving the tradition of marriage between a man and a woman, citing the Supreme Court's previous ruling against interracial marriage bans. The ruling acknowledges the distress caused by same-sex marriage to some, but asserts that distress alone does not justify the immoral ban on gay marriage. This decision aligns with similar conclusions reached by other federal appeals courts, and the issue is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court soon.
