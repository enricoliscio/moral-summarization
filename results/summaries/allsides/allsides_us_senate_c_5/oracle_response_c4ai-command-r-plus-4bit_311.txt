SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete and bipartisan review of the matter. He emphasized the importance of following regular order and approaching the issue with the assumption that Russia does not wish the U.S. well, citing their invasion of Crimea as an example of their adversarial nature. McConnell also condemned allegations of Russian breaches of U.S. cybersecurity measures and suggested that leaked characterizations of Russian motivation should be weighed carefully to avoid partisan bias. He joined other lawmakers in calling for an investigation spanning across jurisdictional lines of Congress, while Trump administration officials have dismissed these efforts as attempts to delegitimize Trump's win.
END OF SUMMARY.
