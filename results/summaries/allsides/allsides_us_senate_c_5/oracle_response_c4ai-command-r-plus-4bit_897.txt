SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete and bipartisan review of the matter. He emphasized the importance of approaching the issue with the assumption that Russia does not wish the U.S. well, noting their invasion of Crimea. McConnell also condemned allegations of Russian breaches of U.S. cybersecurity measures and suggested that leaked characterizations of Russian motivation should be weighed carefully to avoid partisan gain. He joined other lawmakers in calling for a bipartisan investigation spanning across jurisdictional lines of Congress. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as an attempt to delegitimize his win, referring to it as "ridiculous." Trump spokesperson, Jason Miller, echoed this sentiment, stating that the effort to investigate Russian interference is an attempt to delegitimize Trump's victory. END OF SUMMARY.
