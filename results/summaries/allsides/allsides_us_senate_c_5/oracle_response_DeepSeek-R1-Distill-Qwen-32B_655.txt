Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, McConnell is saying the Senate Intelligence Committee should handle the Russian meddling investigation. He's dismissing the idea of a special committee and emphasizing that the Intelligence Committee is capable. He mentions following regular procedures and conducting a bipartisan review. That's important because it shows he's framing it as responsible and proper.

The article also mentions McCain wanting a special committee, but McConnell thinks the current setup is sufficient. There's a focus on the threat from Russia, specifically Putin, and the idea that Russians don't wish us well. McConnell is clear about Russia being an adversary, which adds a moral stance against them.

There's a part about leaks and the potential for them being used for partisan gain. McConnell criticizes leaks as irresponsible and possibly illegal, which ties into the moral framing of responsible actions versus underhanded ones.

The NYT report about Russia helping Trump and harming Clinton is a key point. McConnell's response is cautious, not wanting to comment on nominees yet. Trump's spokesperson dismisses the investigation as coming from bitter losers, which is another moral angleâ€”accusing others of trying to delegitimize the election result.

I need to include as many of the specified moral words as possible: capable, follow, review, threat, threats, bipartisan, invaded, wish, suggesting, activities, leaks, illegally, gain, delegitimize, recount, discussion, raise.

I'll structure the summary to cover McConnell's stance, the committee's capability, the threat from Russia, the bipartisan approach, the issue of leaks and their possible illegality, the NYT report, and the accusations of trying to delegitimize Trump's win.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while hitting all the key points and moral framing.

SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell emphasized that the Senate Intelligence Committee is "capable" of conducting a "complete review" of Russian interference in the U.S. election, dismissing calls for a special committee. He stressed the need to "follow" regular procedures and conduct a "bipartisan" investigation, noting that the committee is well-suited for the task. McConnell described Russian actions as a "threat," particularly highlighting Russia's "invading" Crimea and its "adversarial" stance toward the U.S. He cautioned against "leaks" of intelligence findings, calling them "irresponsible" and potentially "illegal," suggesting they may be motivated by "partisan political gain." McConnell also criticized the idea of a "special committee," asserting that existing committees, including those led by Sen. John McCain, would address the issue. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump's spokesperson dismissed the investigation as an attempt to "delegitimize" Trump's win, linking it to "bitter" losers of the election. The article highlights concerns about Russia's "activities" to influence the election and the potential for "partisan" motives behind the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
