SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for an investigation into recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. McConnell suggested that the Senate Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete and bipartisan review of the allegations, dismissing calls for a special select committee. He emphasized the importance of approaching the issue with the assumption that Russia does not wish the U.S. well, noting their invasion of Crimea. McConnell condemned any leaks about U.S. intelligence findings as irresponsible, illegal, and potentially partisan. He also dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference as an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win, including the recount and popular vote discussions. Trump has also dismissed the CIA report as ridiculous. The investigation will be conducted by the Intelligence Committee on a bipartisan basis, with incoming Senate Democratic Leader Schumer joining as an ex-officio member.
END OF SUMMARY.
