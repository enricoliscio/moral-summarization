SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has dismissed calls for a special select committee to investigate Russian interference in the US presidential election, instead suggesting that the Senate Intelligence Committee should take the lead. McConnell called the allegations of Russian meddling "disturbing" and emphasized the need for a bipartisan review. He noted that he and incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will both sit on the Intelligence Committee and that Senators John McCain and Richard Burr will also conduct their own reviews of cybersecurity threats. McConnell warned that the Russians "do not wish us well" and that their actions should be viewed with caution. However, he also cautioned against leaks about US intelligence findings, suggesting they may be motivated by partisan gain. The comments come as President-elect Donald Trump and his team have dismissed the CIA report, calling it "ridiculous" and an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win.
