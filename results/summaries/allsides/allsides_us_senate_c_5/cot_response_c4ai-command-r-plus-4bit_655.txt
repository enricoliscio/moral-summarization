SUMMARY:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested that the Senate Intelligence Committee investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a bipartisan review. McConnell expressed concerns about Russian cyberattacks and viewed Russian President Vladimir Putin as an adversary, noting Russia's invasion of Crimea. He also emphasized the need to approach the issue with caution, suggesting that leaks about intelligence findings may be partisan. While Trump's spokesman dismissed the investigation as an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win, Trump himself called the CIA report "ridiculous" and suggested that allegations of Russian interference were a conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, some senators, including John McCain, have pushed for a special committee to investigate the matter, emphasizing the importance of addressing cybersecurity threats. McConnell acknowledged the bipartisan efforts of the Intelligence Committee and Armed Services Committee to review the issue.
