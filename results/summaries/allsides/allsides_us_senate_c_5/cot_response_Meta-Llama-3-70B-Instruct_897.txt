SUMMARY:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the allegations of Russian meddling in the US presidential election "disturbing" and said the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter." McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an "adversary" and believes the Russians "do not wish us well." He cautioned against leaked characterizations of the motivation behind Russian hacking, suggesting a possible "partisan" lens. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump's team dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference as coming from "bitter" people who are trying to "delegitimize" Trump's win. Trump himself called the CIA report "ridiculous" and tweeted that if the election results were the opposite, the Russia/CIA card would be called a "conspiracy theory."
END OF SUMMARY.
