SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete review. He noted that he and incoming Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will be part of the committee. McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an adversary, citing Russia's invasion of Crimea and the nervousness of Baltic countries. However, he declined to comment on the possible appointment of ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties with Putin, as Secretary of State. McConnell also cautioned against leaked characterizations of the motivation behind Russian hacking, suggesting a possible partisan lens. The investigation comes as President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report, calling it "ridiculous".
