SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent findings by the CIA that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable" of conducting a complete and bipartisan review. He emphasized that Russia is not an ally of the US and that any breach of US cybersecurity measures is condemnable. McConnell also suggested that leaks about US intelligence findings should be weighed carefully as they may be partisan-motivated. Jason Miller, a spokesman for President-elect Trump, dismissed the investigation as an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win. McConnell's stance highlights the moral imperative to ensure fair and unbiased elections, free from foreign interference, and underscores the importance of a thorough, bipartisan investigation into the matter.
