Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's response to the CIA findings that Russia tried to influence the U.S. election. McConnell says the Senate Intelligence Committee should handle the investigation, dismissing calls for a special committee. He emphasizes the importance of a bipartisan approach and mentions that he and Schumer will be involved. He also criticizes the leaking of intelligence, suggesting it's done for partisan reasons.

On the other side, McCain and others are pushing for a special committee, and Trump's spokesperson Jason Miller dismisses the investigation as politically motivated, saying it's an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win.

I need to make sure the summary captures McConnell's stance, the opposition from McCain and Trump, and the underlying moral issues like partisanship and the integrity of the election. Also, the summary should be concise, around 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by outlining the main points: McConnell's support for the Intelligence Committee, his criticism of leaks, McCain's push for a special committee, Trump's dismissal, and the broader implications of partisanship and election integrity.

Now, I'll craft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes all these elements without being too lengthy. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing, such as the potential for partisan gain and the importance of a fair investigation.
