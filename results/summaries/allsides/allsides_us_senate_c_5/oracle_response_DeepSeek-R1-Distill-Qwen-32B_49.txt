Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

Mitch McConnell is the Senate Majority Leader. He's discussing the CIA findings about Russian interference in the U.S. election. He's dismissing the idea of a special committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is capable of handling it. He emphasizes a bipartisan review. There's mention of the threat from Russia and their activities, like hacking. He criticizes leaks as irresponsible and possibly illegal for partisan gain. Trump's team is dismissing the investigation as an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win, using terms like recount and discussion. McConnell also mentions that Russia isn't a friend, referencing Crimea.

Now, I need to include the morally framed words: capable, follow, review, threat, threats, bipartisan, invaded, wish, suggesting, activities, leaks, illegally, gain, delegitimize, recount, discussion, raise.

I'll structure the summary to cover McConnell's stance, the committee's capability, the threat, the bipartisan approach, Russia's actions, the leaks issue, and the political implications. I'll make sure to use the words naturally within the context.

Let me draft it:

 McConnell opposes a special committee, stating the Intelligence Committee is capable. He wants a bipartisan review. The threat from Russia is real, with activities like hacking. He criticizes leaks as irresponsible and possibly illegal for partisan gain. Trump's team dismisses the investigation, suggesting it's to delegitimize Trump's win, referencing recount and discussion. McConnell highlights Russia's adversarial stance, having invaded Crimea. He urges approaching issues assuming Russia doesn't wish the U.S. well.

I need to check word count. Let me count:... it's under 200 words. I think this captures all the key points and includes the moral words as required.
