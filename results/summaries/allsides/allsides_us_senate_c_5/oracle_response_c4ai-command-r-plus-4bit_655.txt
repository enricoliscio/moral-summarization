SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable" of conducting a complete and bipartisan review of the matter. McConnell emphasized the importance of approaching the issue with the assumption that Russia does not "wish us well," noting their invasion of Crimea. He also suggested that leaked characterizations of Russian motivation should be weighed carefully, as they may be partisan attempts to delegitimize Trump's win. Other senators, such as John McCain (R-Ariz.), have continued to push for a special committee to investigate Russian cyber threats. Meanwhile, Trump has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous." This article highlights the differing approaches and views within the Republican Party regarding the seriousness and handling of Russian interference in the election.
