SUMMARY:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate allegations of Russian meddling in the US presidential election, describing the claims as "disturbing". McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable" of conducting a review. He views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an "adversary", citing Russia's invasion of Crimea. McConnell warned that the Russians "do not wish us well" and that the US should approach these issues with caution. He condemned allegations of Russian hacking, but cautioned against leaked characterizations of the motivation behind it, suggesting a possible "partisan" lens. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous", calling efforts to investigate Russian interference an attempt to "delegitimize" his win. END OF SUMMARY.
