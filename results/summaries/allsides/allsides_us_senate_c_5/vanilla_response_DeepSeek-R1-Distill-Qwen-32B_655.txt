Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's response to recent CIA findings that Russia tried to influence the U.S. election. He says the allegations are disturbing and believes the Senate Intelligence Committee should handle the investigation. He dismisses calls for a special committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is capable. He also mentions that he and incoming Democratic Leader Schumer will be part of the panel.

John McCain wants a special committee, but McConnell thinks the current setup is sufficient. McConnell criticizes Russia, calling them adversaries, especially after their actions in Crimea. He avoids commenting on Rex Tillerson's nomination for Secretary of State. He's cautious about the CIA report's motivations, suggesting leaks might be partisan. The New York Times reports that Russia aimed to help Trump and harm Clinton. Trump's spokesman dismisses the investigation as sour grapes from Clinton supporters, and Trump himself called the report ridiculous on Twitter.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on McConnell's stance, the committee's role, McCain's position, McConnell's comments on Russia, the nomination, the CIA report's details, and Trump's response.

Let me structure it: Start with McConnell's position, mention the committee, McCain's desire for a special committee, McConnell's dismissal, Russia's actions, nomination avoidance, CIA report, NYT details, Trump's reaction, and McConnell's caution on leaks.

I should make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. Keep it concise and clear.
