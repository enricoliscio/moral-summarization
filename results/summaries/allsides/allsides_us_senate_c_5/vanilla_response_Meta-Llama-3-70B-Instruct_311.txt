SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate allegations of Russian interference in the US presidential election. McConnell described the allegations as "disturbing" and said the committee is "more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter." He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee can handle the investigation on a bipartisan basis. McConnell also expressed skepticism about leaked characterizations of Russian hacking, suggesting they may be motivated by partisan politics. He declined to comment on the possible appointment of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, citing close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous" and his spokesman said efforts to investigate Russian interference are attempts to "delegitimize" Trump's win.

END OF SUMMARY.
