SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that the Russian government attempted to influence the US presidential election, deeming the allegations "disturbing". McConnell believes the committee is "more than capable" of conducting a complete review of the matter, dismissing calls for a special select committee. He emphasized the importance of following the "regular order" and reviewing the issue on a bipartisan basis. McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an adversary, stating that "the Russians are not our friends" and that they "invaded Crimea". He warned that the US should approach these issues assuming Russia "does not wish us well". Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report, calling it "ridiculous", and his spokesman claimed that efforts to investigate Russian interference are an attempt to "delegitimize" Trump's win.
