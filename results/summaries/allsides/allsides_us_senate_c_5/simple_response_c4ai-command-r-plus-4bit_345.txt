SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for an investigation into recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election, suggesting that the Senate Intelligence Committee take the lead. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete and bipartisan review. He emphasized that Russia is not an ally of the US and that any breach of US cybersecurity measures is condemnable. McConnell also cautioned against the partisan interpretation of leaked intelligence findings, stating that it is irresponsible and potentially illegal. Jason Miller, a spokesman for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed the investigation as an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win, arguing that it is part of a narrative to undermine the election results. Trump himself has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous" and suggested that the focus on Russia is a conspiracy theory. This response highlights a moral dilemma between pursuing the truth and preserving the integrity of the election process, versus accepting the results and moving forward with a potential adversary in the White House.
