SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings on Russian interference in the US presidential election, dismissing calls for a special select committee. McConnell views Russia as an adversary and believes the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete review of the matter. He emphasized the importance of approaching the issue on the assumption that Russia does not wish the US well. However, he cautioned against leaks about US intelligence findings, suggesting they may be motivated by partisan gain. McConnell's stance is in contrast to President-elect Donald Trump, who has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous" and suggested that efforts to investigate Russian interference are an attempt to delegitimize his win. The moral framing of this issue highlights the importance of putting national security above partisan interests and ensuring that investigations are conducted in a fair and bipartisan manner.
