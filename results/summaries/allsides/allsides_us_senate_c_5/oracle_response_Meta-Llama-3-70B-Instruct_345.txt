SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that the Russian government tried to influence the U.S. presidential election, labeling the allegations "disturbing". He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter" and will follow a "bipartisan basis". McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an adversary, noting that "the Russians are not our friends" and "invaded Crimea". He cautioned against leaks about U.S. intelligence findings, calling them "irresponsible, likely illegally and potentially for partisan political gain". Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump's team dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference as an attempt to "delegitimize" Trump's win. Trump himself called the CIA report "ridiculous" and suggested on Twitter that if the election results were opposite, the opposite claims would be made.
