Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral aspects involved.

The article is about Mitch McConnell's response to the CIA findings on Russian interference in the U.S. election. He suggests that the Senate Intelligence Committee should handle the investigation instead of a special committee. He emphasizes that the Intelligence Committee is capable and that they should work bipartisanly. He also criticizes leaks of intelligence findings, calling them irresponsible and possibly for partisan gain. McConnell distances himself from commenting on Rex Tillerson's nomination and dismisses the idea that Russia tried to help Trump, though Trump himself has downplayed the CIA report.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be about the integrity of the investigation process, the responsibility in handling sensitive information, and the potential for partisanship. McConnell is portrayed as cautious about special committees, preferring established ones to avoid partisanship. He's also critical of leaks, which could be seen as a moral stance against irresponsible information sharing. On the other hand, Trump's dismissal of the report and the implication that the investigation is politically motivated adds another layer of moral judgment about the legitimacy of the inquiry.

I need to make sure the summary captures these elements without losing the moral perspective. It should mention McConnell's stance on the committee, his criticism of leaks, the potential partisanship, and Trump's reaction. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and preserves the original moral framing.

SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, dismissing the need for a special committee. He emphasized the panel's capability to conduct a bipartisan review, though he criticized leaks of intelligence findings as irresponsible and potentially politically motivated. McConnell also declined to comment on Rex Tillerson's nomination for Secretary of State, urging patience until nominees are confirmed. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump dismissed the CIA report, calling it "ridiculous," and accused opponents of using the issue to delegitimize his victory. McConnell's cautious approach highlights concerns about partisanship and the integrity of the investigation process, while Trump's dismissal raises questions about the political motivations behind the inquiry. END OF SUMMARY.
