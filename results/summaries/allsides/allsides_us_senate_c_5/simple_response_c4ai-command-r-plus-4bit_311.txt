SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for an investigation into recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election, suggesting that the Senate Intelligence Committee should take the lead on the review. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable" of conducting a complete and bipartisan review. He emphasized the seriousness of the allegations, noting that Russia is not an ally of the U.S. and has previously invaded Crimea. McConnell also cautioned against jumping to conclusions based on leaked information, suggesting that any leaks of U.S. intelligence findings may be irresponsible and politically motivated. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous" and accused those calling for an investigation of attempting to delegitimize his election win. However, the Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr has stated that he will conduct a bipartisan review of the issue alongside Senator John McCain, who will also investigate cybersecurity threats as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
END OF SUMMARY.
