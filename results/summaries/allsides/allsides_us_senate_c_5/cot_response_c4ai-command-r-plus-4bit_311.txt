SUMMARY: Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable" of conducting a complete review. McConnell emphasized that Russia is not an ally, noting their invasion of Crimea and the concerns of Baltic countries about Russian aggression. He also condemned allegations of Russian hacking and any leaks of intelligence findings as irresponsible and potentially illegal. Trump's team has dismissed the CIA report as an attempt to delegitimize his win, calling it "ridiculous" and a "conspiracy theory." Other senators, such as John McCain, have pushed for a special committee to investigate, citing the importance of national security and the threat posed by Russia. The Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman, Richard Burr, is expected to lead a bipartisan review of the matter alongside McCain's review of cybersecurity threats. The moral framing of the article centers around terms like "disturbing," "irresponsible," and "partisan," reflecting concerns about the integrity of the election and the potential for geopolitical threats.
