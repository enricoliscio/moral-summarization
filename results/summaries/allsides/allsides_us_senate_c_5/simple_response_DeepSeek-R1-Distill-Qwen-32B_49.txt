Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article. They mentioned that I should preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, first, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's response to Russian meddling in the U.S. election. 

I notice that the article talks about McConnell dismissing the idea of a special committee and instead supporting the Intelligence Committee. There's a moral angle here because it's about the integrity of the election and the trust in the process. McConnell is emphasizing a bipartisan approach, which is a positive moral stance on cooperation.

The user wants the summary to be no longer than 200 words and to end with specific tokens. I need to make sure I capture the key points: McConnell's stance, his dismissal of a special committee, his support for the Intelligence Committee, his view on Russia, and the political implications. Also, including Trump's dismissal of the CIA report adds another layer of the moral debate.

I should structure the summary to highlight McConnell's leadership and his emphasis on proper procedures, while also noting the political divide, especially with Trump's comments. This way, the moral framing about the importance of thorough investigation and the potential for political bias is preserved.

Let me make sure I don't miss any crucial details. McConnell mentions that Russia is an adversary, which is a strong statement. Also, the mention of bipartisan efforts is important for the moral aspect of unity in addressing the issue. I'll need to keep it concise but comprehensive within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate Russian interference in the U.S. election, dismissing calls for a special select committee. McConnell emphasized the committee's capability and commitment to a bipartisan review, while noting that incoming Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would join the panel. McConnell criticized Russia's actions, describing them as adversarial, and warned against leaks of intelligence findings, which he labeled as irresponsible and potentially politically motivated. He declined to comment on Rex Tillerson's potential nomination as Secretary of State. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump and his spokesman dismissed the CIA findings as "ridiculous" and accused opponents of attempting to delegitimize Trump's victory. McConnell's stance reflects a broader moral debate over the integrity of the election process and the need for thorough, non-partisan investigation to address concerns of foreign influence. END OF SUMMARY.
