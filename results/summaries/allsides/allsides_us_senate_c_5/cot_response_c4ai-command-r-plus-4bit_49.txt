SUMMARY: Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has suggested that the Senate Intelligence Committee investigate recent CIA findings indicating Russian interference in the US presidential election. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable of conducting a complete review". He emphasized the bipartisan nature of the committee and expressed his belief that Russia is an adversary rather than a friend, citing their invasion of Crimea. McConnell also condemned allegations of Russian breaches of US cybersecurity measures but cautioned against partisan interpretation of intelligence findings. He dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference as attempts to delegitimize Trump's win, calling it "nonsense" and a "conspiracy theory". Trump himself has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous". Meanwhile, other senators, including John McCain, have pushed for a special committee to investigate the issue, citing national security concerns. The CIA findings suggest that Russia acted to help Trump and harm Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. END OF SUMMARY.
