SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a bipartisan review. McConnell acknowledged the threat posed by Russia and viewed Russian President Vladimir Putin as an adversary. He also noted that the leaders of the Senate Intelligence, Foreign Relations, and Armed Services panels would play a role in the investigation. McConnell condemned allegations of Russian hacking but cautioned against partisan interpretation of leaked intelligence findings. Jason Miller, a spokesman for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed the investigation as an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win. Trump himself called the CIA report "ridiculous" and suggested that it was a conspiracy theory.
