SUMMARY:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called allegations of Russian meddling in the US presidential election "disturbing" and said the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable" of conducting a review. McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an "adversary" and noted that the Russians "invaded Crimea" and "do not wish us well." He condemned allegations of Russian hacking, but cautioned against leaked characterizations of the motivation behind it, suggesting a possible "partisan" lens. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump's team dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference as coming from "bitter" people who are trying to "delegitimize" Trump's win, calling the CIA report "ridiculous."
END OF SUMMARY.
