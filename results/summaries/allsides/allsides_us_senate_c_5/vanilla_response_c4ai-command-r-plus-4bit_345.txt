SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, expressing confidence in the Intelligence Committee's capabilities. McConnell acknowledged the bipartisan concern over Russian meddling and emphasized that the issue would be reviewed on a bipartisan basis. He also noted that the incoming Senate Democratic Leader, Charles Schumer, would join the committee. McConnell's comments come amid reports that American intelligence agencies concluded Russia interfered to aid Trump's victory, which Trump has dismissed as "ridiculous." McConnell further stated that Russia is not an ally of the U.S. and emphasized the need to approach issues with Russia assuming they do not wish the U.S. well. A spokesman for Trump dismissed the investigation as an attempt to delegitimize his win.
