SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings on Russian interference in the US presidential election, deeming the allegations "disturbing" and a "threat" to national security. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable of conducting a complete review" of the matter on a "bipartisan basis". McConnell noted that he and incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will join the committee, ensuring a thorough and impartial investigation. He warned that the Russians "do not wish us well" and have a history of "invading" other countries, citing their actions in Crimea. McConnell cautioned against "leaks" and "partisan political gain" in the investigation, suggesting that some characterizations of Russian hacking may be motivated by political bias. He declined to comment on the potential appointment of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Secretary of State. END OF SUMMARY.
