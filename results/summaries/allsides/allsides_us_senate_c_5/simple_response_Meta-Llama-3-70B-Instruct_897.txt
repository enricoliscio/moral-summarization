SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings on Russian interference in the US presidential election, labeling the allegations as "disturbing." However, he dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete review. McConnell also warned against leaks of US intelligence findings, suggesting they may be motivated by partisan gain. His stance is in contrast to Sen. John McCain, who called for a special committee to investigate the matter. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump and his team have dismissed the CIA report, calling it "ridiculous" and an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win. The moral framing of this issue is clear: McConnell and McCain are taking a bipartisan approach to investigate a serious national security threat, while Trump and his team are downplaying the issue and accusing others of being "bitter" about their loss.

END OF SUMMARY.
