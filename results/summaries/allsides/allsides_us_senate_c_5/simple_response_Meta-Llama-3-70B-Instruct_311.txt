SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate allegations of Russian interference in the US presidential election, dismissing calls for a special select committee. McConnell, who sits on the committee, believes it is "more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter." He emphasized the need for a bipartisan approach, citing the committee's ability to review the matter without political bias. McConnell also expressed his distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that "the Russians are not our friends" and that the US should approach issues with Russia assuming they do not wish the US well. However, he cautioned against leaked characterizations of Russian hacking motivations, suggesting a possible partisan lens. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous" and his spokesman claimed that efforts to investigate Russian interference are attempts to "delegitimize" Trump's win.
