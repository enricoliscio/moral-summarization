Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Mitch McConnell's response to the CIA findings on Russian interference in the U.S. election. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, McConnell is the Senate Majority Leader, and he's saying the Senate Intelligence Committee should handle the investigation. He's dismissing the idea of a special committee, which some other senators like John McCain suggested. I should note that he believes the Intelligence Committee is capable enough and wants a bipartisan approach.

Also, McConnell mentioned that he and Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader, are part of the panel. That's important because it shows bipartisan involvement. He's critical of Russia, calling them adversaries, especially after their actions in Crimea.

There's a part where McConnell is cautious about leaked information, saying it might be politically motivated. That's a significant point because it touches on the reliability of the intelligence findings.

The article also mentions Trump's spokesperson dismissing the investigation as partisan, which is a counterpoint to McConnell's stance. And Trump himself downplayed the CIA report, which adds context about the political climate around this issue.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll structure it to include McConnell's position, his reasoning, the bipartisan angle, his criticism of Russia, caution on leaks, and the political reactions from Trump and his team. That should cover the main elements without getting too detailed.
