Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key players are McConnell, McCain, Schumer, and others discussing how to investigate Russian interference in the election. McConnell prefers the Intelligence Committee, while McCain wants a special committee. They mention the threat from Russia and the need for a bipartisan approach. There's also criticism of leaks and partisanship. Trump's team is dismissing the investigations as attempts to delegitimize his win. I should include the morally framed words like capable, review, threat, bipartisan, etc. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell emphasized the importance of the Senate Intelligence Committee reviewing Russian interference in the U.S. election, calling the allegations "disturbing" and asserting the committee is "capable" of conducting a "complete review." He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating the Intelligence Committee would handle the matter "on a bipartisan basis." McConnell noted that incoming Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would join the panel, alongside Sen. John McCain, who also advocated for a special committee. McConnell criticized Russia's actions, labeling them as adversaries, and warned against "partisan political gain" from leaked intelligence. He declined to comment on Rex Tillerson's potential nomination as Secretary of State. Meanwhile, Trump's team dismissed the investigations as attempts to "delegitimize" Trump's win, with Trump himself calling the CIA report "ridiculous." The article highlights the "threat" posed by Russia and the need for a "bipartisan" approach to address "cybersecurity measures." END OF SUMMARY.
