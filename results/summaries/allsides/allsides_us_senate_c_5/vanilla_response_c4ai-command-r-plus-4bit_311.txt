SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete and bipartisan review of the matter. He emphasized that Russia is not an ally of the U.S. and that any breach of U.S. cybersecurity measures is condemnable. However, McConnell cautioned against partisan interpretations of leaked intelligence findings. Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain and other bipartisan lawmakers have pushed for a separate investigation spanning multiple congressional committees. McCain suggested a select committee involving the leaders of the Senate Intelligence, Foreign Relations, and Armed Services panels. President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as an attempt to delegitimize his election win, while his spokesman, Jason Miller, called the efforts to investigate Russian interference as "nonsense".
END OF SUMMARY.
