Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words, and I need to make sure those are included in the summary. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's response to the CIA findings that Russia tried to influence the U.S. election. McConnell supports the Senate Intelligence Committee handling the investigation, dismissing the idea of a special committee. He emphasizes the committee's capability and the need for a bipartisan review. He also criticizes leaks of intelligence findings, calling them irresponsible and possibly illegal for partisan gain. McCain and Schumer are pushing for a broader investigation, but McConnell believes the existing committees can handle it. McConnell also comments on Trump's dismissal of the CIA report and the potential political motives behind the investigation.

Now, I need to extract the key points and incorporate the morally framed words: capable, follow, review, threat, threats, bipartisan, invaded, wish, suggesting, activities, leaks, illegally, gain, delegitimize, recount, discussion, raise.

I should structure the summary to include McConnell's support for the Intelligence Committee, the need for a bipartisan review, the threat from Russia, the leaks and their implications, and the political motivations behind the investigation. Also, mention the criticism of the CIA report and the possible gain from the leaks.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed words as possible. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the moral framing words.

First, McConnell supports the Intelligence Committee, which is capable. He wants to follow the regular order and conduct a bipartisan review. The threat from Russia is a key point. He mentions that the Russians don't wish the U.S. well, referring to their invasion of Crimea. He suggests that the leaks might be for partisan gain and are irresponsible, possibly illegal. He also notes the attempt to delegitimize Trump's win through these discussions and activities, possibly raising issues for political gain.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep it under 200 words.
