SUMMARY:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election, labeling the allegations as "disturbing". McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, instead opting for a bipartisan review by the Intelligence Committee. He views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an "adversary" and notes that the Russians "do not wish us well". McConnell also expressed concerns about leaked characterizations of Russian hacking, suggesting they may be "irresponsible" and "partisan". Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous" and his spokesman claimed that efforts to investigate Russian interference are attempts to "delegitimize" Trump's win. END OF SUMMARY.
