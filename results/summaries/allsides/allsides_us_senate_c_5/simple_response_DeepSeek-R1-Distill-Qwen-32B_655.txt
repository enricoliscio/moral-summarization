Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Mitch McConnell's response to Russian interference in the U.S. election. He wants the Senate Intelligence Committee to handle the investigation instead of a special committee. He emphasizes that the Intelligence Committee is capable and that they'll do it on a bipartisan basis. He also criticizes leaks about intelligence findings, calling them irresponsible and possibly for partisan gain. McCain and Schumer are pushing for a broader investigation, which McConnell is resisting. McConnell also mentions that the Russians are adversaries, especially regarding Crimea. Trump's team is dismissing the investigation as politically motivated. The summary needs to capture McConnell's stance, the push for a special committee, the criticism of leaks, and the political implications. I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like McConnell's concern about partisanship and the potential misuse of intelligence leaks. Also, note Trump's dismissal and the political divide it represents. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll structure it to first mention McConnell's position, then the opposition, the criticism of leaks, and the broader political context.
