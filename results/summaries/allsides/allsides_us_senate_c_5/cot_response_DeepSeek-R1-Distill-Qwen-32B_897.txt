Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to identify the morally framed words first. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the context and the key points.

The article is about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's response to the CIA findings that Russia tried to influence the U.S. election. He's saying that the Senate Intelligence Committee should handle the investigation, dismissing calls for a special committee. There's mention of Sen. John McCain and others pushing for a broader investigation. McConnell emphasizes that Russia is an adversary, not a friend, and criticizes the leaking of intelligence findings as irresponsible and possibly for partisan gain. Trump's spokesperson dismisses the investigation as politically motivated, and Trump himself called the CIA report ridiculous.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. Let me go through the article again and pick out words that have a strong moral connotation.

- "disturbing" (used to describe the allegations)
- "should" (as in McConnell's call for the committee to investigate)
- "capable" (referring to the committee's ability)
- "complete" (as in a thorough review)
- "bipartisan" (emphasizing non-partisan approach)
- "irresponsibly" (describing the leaking of information)
- "illegally" (same context)
- "partisan" (used to describe possible motives)
- "delegitimize" (the accusation against the investigation)
- "ridiculous" (Trump's dismissal of the report)
- "conspiracy theory" (Trump's counter-accusation)

I think these words carry the moral weight in the article, indicating McConnell's stance against Russia's actions, his caution about leaks, and the political backlash against the investigation.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these morally framed words intact. I should mention McConnell's support for the Intelligence Committee, his dismissal of a special committee, his view of Russia as an adversary, the criticism of leaks, and the political pushback from Trump's side.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key points without getting bogged down in details. I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll include words like "disturbing," "should," "capable," "complete," "bipartisan," "irresponsibly," "illegally," "partisan," "delegitimize," "ridiculous," and "conspiracy theory."

Let me structure the summary step by step. Start with McConnell's stance on the investigation, mention McCain's push for a special committee, McConnell's emphasis on the Intelligence Committee's capability, his view of Russia, criticism of leaks, and then the political responses from Trump and his spokesperson.

I should also note that McConnell declined to comment on Tillerson's nomination but supported the intelligence findings while cautioning against leaks. Trump's spokesperson dismissed the investigation as politically motivated, and Trump himself dismissed the report as ridiculous, suggesting a conspiracy theory if the election results were different.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, covering McConnell's position, the committee's role, the criticism of leaks, and the political pushback. I need to make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll write the summary, then count the words. If it's over, I'll trim it down without losing essential information.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure to include all the key points and the morally framed words as identified.

**Summary:**

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate Russian interference in the U.S. election, deeming the allegations "disturbing." He dismissed the idea of a special committee, asserting the Intelligence Committee is "capable" of a "complete" review on a "bipartisan" basis. McConnell criticized leaks of intelligence findings as "irresponsible" and possibly "illegally" motivated, warning against "partisan" gains. Sen. John McCain and others advocated for a broader inquiry. McConnell highlighted Russia as an adversary, noting their invasion of Crimea. Trump's spokesperson dismissed the investigation as politically motivated, aiming to "delegitimize" Trump's win. Trump labeled the CIA report "ridiculous," suggesting a "conspiracy theory" if the election results were reversed. McConnell declined to comment on Tillerson's nomination but emphasized following the intelligence findings while cautioning against leaks. The summary captures McConnell's stance, the committee's role, criticism of leaks, and political responses, all while preserving the moral framing.
