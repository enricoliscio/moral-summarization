SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings on Russian interference in the US presidential election, deeming the allegations "disturbing". He believes the committee is "more than capable" of conducting a thorough review, dismissing calls for a special select committee. McConnell emphasized the importance of a bipartisan approach, stating that the committee will "follow the regular order" and review the matter on a bipartisan basis. He also expressed concerns about Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that "the Russians are not our friends" and that they "invaded Crimea". McConnell warned against "leaks" of intelligence findings, suggesting they may be motivated by "partisan political gain". Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump's team has dismissed the investigation as an attempt to "delegitimize" his win, calling it a "conspiracy theory". END OF SUMMARY.
