SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete review. McConnell noted that he and incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will both sit on the committee. Sen. John McCain, a leading voice on national security, had called for a special committee to investigate the issue. McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an adversary and believes the Russians do not wish the US well. He declined to comment on the possible appointment of ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. McConnell also cautioned against leaked characterizations of the motivation behind Russian hacking, suggesting a possible partisan lens.
