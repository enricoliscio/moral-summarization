SUMMARY:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested that the Senate Intelligence Committee investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable of conducting a bipartisan, complete review" of the "disturbing" allegations. McConnell emphasized the need to approach the issue assuming that Russia does not wish the US well, citing their invasion of Crimea. He also condemned leaks about US intelligence findings as potentially "irresponsible, illegal, and partisan". Trump's team has dismissed the investigation as an attempt to "delegitimize" his win, calling the CIA report "ridiculous" and suggesting it is a "conspiracy theory". Meanwhile, other senators, including John McCain, have pushed for a more comprehensive investigation, spanning multiple committees. The debate over how to handle the situation continues, with some calling for a cautious and bipartisan approach, while others seek to downplay the significance of Russian interference.
