SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings that Russia tried to influence the US presidential election. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete review of the matter. He noted that he and incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will be part of the committee. McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an adversary and believes the Russians do not wish the US well. However, he declined to comment on the possible appointment of ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties with Putin, as Secretary of State. McConnell also cautioned against leaked characterizations of the motivation behind Russian hacking, suggesting a possible partisan lens. President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report, calling it "ridiculous" and suggesting that efforts to investigate Russian interference are attempts to delegitimize his win.
