Okay, so I need to help summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure to follow: first, identify all the morally framed single words, and then write a concise summary using those words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Mitch McConnell's response to the CIA findings on Russian interference in the U.S. election. He's suggesting the Senate Intelligence Committee handle the investigation instead of a special committee. There's mention of partisanship, accusations, and the implications of Russia's actions.

For the first step, I need to find all the single words that carry moral implications. Words like "disturbing," "capable," "bipartisan," "adversary," "friends," "invasion," "nervous," "condemns," "irresponsible," "illegal," "partisan," "delegitimize," "ridiculous," and "conspiracy." These words carry judgments or evaluations, so they're key to the moral framing.

Next, I'll write the summary. I need to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning McConnell's call for the Intelligence Committee to investigate, highlighting his dismissal of a special committee. I'll note his bipartisan approach and his view of Russia as an adversary. I'll include his warnings about leaks and the potential for partisan gain. I'll also touch on Trump's dismissal of the report and the accusations of partisanship from Trump's team.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first present McConnell's stance, then the context of Russia's actions, the warnings about leaks, and finally Trump's response. This should cover all the moral elements while staying concise.

I should double-check that I didn't miss any morally framed words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content. Also, I need to ensure that the summary doesn't introduce any new information not present in the original text. 

Putting it all together, the summary should effectively convey the political dynamics, the concerns about Russia, and the partisanship involved, all while using the identified morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate Russian interference in the U.S. election, dismissing calls for a special committee. He emphasized a bipartisan approach and warned against leaks, which he deemed irresponsible and potentially partisan. McConnell condemned Russian actions, labeling them as adversarial and noting their invasion of Crimea. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump dismissed the CIA report as "ridiculous," accusing critics of attempting to delegitimize his win. Trump's team accused opponents of using the issue for partisan gain, framing it as a conspiracy theory. McConnell also criticized the leak of intelligence findings, warning against their misuse for political advantage. END OF SUMMARY.
