SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called for an investigation into recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. McConnell suggested that the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), should take the lead in the investigation, dismissing calls for a special select committee. He emphasized the need for a bipartisan and thorough review of the matter, acknowledging the potential for partisan bias in leaked intelligence information. McConnell also expressed his view that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, is an adversary of the United States, citing their invasion of Crimea. He declined to comment on the potential appointment of Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil with close ties to Putin, as Secretary of State. McConnell's stance contrasts with President-elect Donald Trump's dismissal of the CIA report as "ridiculous." A spokesman for Trump characterized the investigation as an attempt to delegitimize Trump's win.
