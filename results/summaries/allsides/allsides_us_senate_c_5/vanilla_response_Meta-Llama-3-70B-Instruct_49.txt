SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the CIA's findings that Russia attempted to influence the US presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete review of the matter. McConnell noted that he and incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will both sit on the committee and review the issue on a bipartisan basis. He also expressed concerns about Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him an adversary and stating that the US should approach issues with Russia assuming they do not wish the US well. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report, calling it "ridiculous" and suggesting that the investigation is an attempt to delegitimize his win.

END OF SUMMARY.
