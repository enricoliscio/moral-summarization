Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The user has specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I need to make sure the summary captures the ethical implications and the perspectives presented.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's response to the CIA findings on Russian interference in the U.S. election. He's suggesting that the Senate Intelligence Committee handle the investigation instead of a special committee. There's some tension between McConnell and McCain, who supports a special committee. McConnell also comments on the partisanship around the issue, criticizing leaks and suggesting they might be politically motivated. Trump's spokesperson dismisses the investigation as a way to delegitimize Trump's win.

Now, the moral framing here seems to involve concerns about partisanship, the integrity of the investigation process, and the implications of Russian actions on U.S. democracy. McConnell is emphasizing the existing committee's capability and the need for a bipartisan approach, while others like McCain are pushing for a more specialized investigation. There's also the moral concern about the integrity of elections and the potential for foreign interference.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: McConnell's stance, the call for a special committee, the partisanship angle, McConnell's comments on the leaks, and Trump's dismissal. Also, the moral implications like the threat to democracy and the need for unbiased investigation should be clear.

I should structure the summary to first mention McConnell's position, then the opposing view from McCain, touch on the partisanship and leaks, and conclude with Trump's response. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft that, making sure to highlight the moral aspects like the threat to democracy, the potential for political gain from leaks, and the importance of a bipartisan approach.
