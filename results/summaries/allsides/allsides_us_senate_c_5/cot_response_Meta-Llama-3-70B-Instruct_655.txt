SUMMARY:
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the allegations of Russian meddling in the US presidential election "disturbing" and said the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, saying the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter." McConnell views Russian President Vladimir Putin as an "adversary" and said the US should approach issues with Russia on the assumption that they "do not wish us well." He condemned allegations of Russian hacking, but cautioned against leaked characterizations of the motivation behind it, suggesting a possible "partisan" lens. Trump's team dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference as coming from "people who are bitter their candidate lost" and trying to "delegitimize" Trump's win. Trump himself called the CIA report "ridiculous."
