SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a bipartisan review. McConnell emphasized that Russia is not an ally and that any breach of U.S. cybersecurity measures is condemnable. He also suggested that leaked intelligence findings may be politically motivated. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump dismissed the CIA report as ridiculous and accused the Democrats of attempting to delegitimize his win. Trump spokesperson, Jason Miller, echoed this sentiment, stating that the investigation calls are attempts to delegitimize Trump's victory. McConnell noted that the Intelligence Committee's review will be bipartisan and that incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will join the panel.
