SUMMARY:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that the Russian government tried to influence the U.S. presidential election, deeming the allegations "disturbing". He dismissed calls for a special select committee, instead opting for a bipartisan review by the Intelligence Committee, which he believes is "more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter". McConnell noted that he and incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer will both sit on the panel, ensuring a bipartisan approach. He also made clear his views on Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that "the Russians are not our friends" and that they "invaded Crimea". McConnell cautioned against leaks about U.S. intelligence findings, suggesting they may be "irresponsible" and "illegally" obtained for "partisan political gain". In contrast, President-elect Donald Trump's team dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference as an attempt to "delegitimize" his win.
