Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's response to recent CIA findings regarding Russian interference in the U.S. election. He's suggesting that the Senate Intelligence Committee handle the investigation instead of forming a special committee. Some senators like John McCain are pushing for a special committee, but McConnell believes the existing committee is capable. 

McConnell mentions that he's on the Intelligence Committee and that Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader, will also join. He emphasizes a bipartisan approach. He's critical of Russia, calling them adversaries, especially regarding their actions in Crimea. 

He also touches on the nomination of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, saying he's impressed with the nominations but won't comment on Tillerson specifically. He advises waiting for official nominees. 

There's mention of media reports that Russia tried to help Trump and hurt Clinton, which McConnell advises to be cautious about, suggesting possible partisan motives. Trump's spokesperson dismisses the investigation as sour grapes from Clinton supporters, and Trump himself calls the CIA report ridiculous.

So, the key points are McConnell's stance on using the Intelligence Committee, the opposition from McCain, McConnell's view on Russia, his caution about media reports, and Trump's dismissal of the issue. I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main actors and their positions.
