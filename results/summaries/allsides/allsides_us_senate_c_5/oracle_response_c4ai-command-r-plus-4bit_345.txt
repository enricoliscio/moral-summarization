SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. McConnell dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is "more than capable" of conducting a complete and bipartisan review of the matter. He emphasized the importance of following regular order and approaching the issue with the assumption that Russia does not wish the U.S. well, citing Russia's invasion of Crimea as an example of their adversarial behavior. McConnell also expressed concern about leaked characterizations of Russian motivations, suggesting they may be partisan and illegal attempts to gain political advantage. He joined other lawmakers in condemning any Russian attempts to breach U.S. cybersecurity measures. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as an attempt to delegitimize his win, and a spokesman for Trump characterized the calls for investigation as efforts by bitter opponents to delegitimize his victory.
