SUMMARY: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate recent CIA findings that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. He dismissed calls for a special select committee, stating that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a complete and bipartisan review of the matter. McConnell emphasized that Russia is not an ally of the U.S. and that any allegations of Russian meddling are disturbing. He also noted that the Senate Armed Services Committee will be conducting its own review of cybersecurity threats, led by Sen. John McCain. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has dismissed the CIA report as ridiculous and suggested that allegations of Russian interference are an attempt to delegitimize his election win. A spokesman for Trump, Jason Miller, echoed this sentiment, stating that the efforts to investigate Russian interference are coming from people bitter about their candidate's loss.
