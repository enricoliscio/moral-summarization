Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about former Defense Secretary Mattis criticizing Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Mattis, who resigned from Trump's cabinet over policy differences, has now criticized Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. He's talking about how Trump is dividing Americans and warning against militarizing the response to protests. Mattis refers to specific events where peaceful protesters were cleared to make way for Trump's photo op, which he calls an abuse of executive authority.

He also mentions that the current Defense Secretary, Esper, opposes using the Insurrection Act, which would allow deploying the military domestically. Mattis argues against using the military as a "battlespace" and says it should only be used when requested by state governors. He's concerned about politicizing the military and the impact on soldiers.

The article also notes that Mattis has remained mostly silent about Trump since resigning but was moved to speak up due to the protests over George Floyd's death and the use of National Guard troops. He emphasizes that the protests are about equal justice and that the country should focus on that rather than the few lawbreakers. Mattis criticizes Trump for dividing the country instead of uniting it, which he sees as a failure of leadership.

Trump responds by calling Mattis the "world's most overrated General" and mentions their past disagreements. Mattis also touches on the pandemic response, highlighting how various Americans are putting their lives on the line and the need to hold accountable those who mock the Constitution.

So, putting this together, the summary should include Mattis's criticism of Trump's handling of protests, the specific incidents he refers to, his stance against military involvement, his reasons for speaking up now, and Trump's response. Also, Mattis's broader points about unity and constitutional rights should be included.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these key points without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by first introducing Mattis's criticism, then the specifics of his concerns, his reasons for speaking up, and Trump's response, ending with Mattis's call for unity and accountability.
