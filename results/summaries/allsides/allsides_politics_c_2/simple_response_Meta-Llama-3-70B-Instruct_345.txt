SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis condemned the use of military force against peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He emphasized that the military's role is to protect citizens, not to dominate them. Mattis also criticized Trump's divisive strategy, saying he is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Instead, Trump tries to divide us, and we are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. Mattis urged Americans to reject those in office who would make a mockery of the Constitution and to listen to their "better angels" as they work to unite.
