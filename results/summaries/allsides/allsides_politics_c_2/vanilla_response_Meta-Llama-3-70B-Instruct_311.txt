SUMMARY:

Retired Marine General Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, has issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, saying Trump has sought to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis condemned the use of troops to clear peaceful protesters from around the White House, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He also rejected the idea of using the military to "dominate" protesters, saying it's not the military's role to quash demonstrations. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying he's the first president in his lifetime who doesn't try to unite the American people. Trump responded to the criticism, calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General." Mattis' statement was published in The Atlantic, where he wrote that the country's response to the pandemic shows that Americans are willing to make sacrifices for the safety of their community.
