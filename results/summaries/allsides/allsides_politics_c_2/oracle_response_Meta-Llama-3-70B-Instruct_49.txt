SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and abusing executive authority. Mattis warned against "militarizing our response" to protests, citing the oath to support and defend the Constitution. He condemned the use of troops to clear peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority" and a "bizarre photo op" for Trump. Mattis argued that the military should only be used at home when requested by state governors, and that the country's response to the pandemic showed that Americans are willing to make sacrifices for the safety of their communities. He accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying the president "tries to divide us" and has shown "disdain for the rights of peaceful protest." Mattis urged Americans to "reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution" and to "unite" behind the demand for equal justice under the law.
