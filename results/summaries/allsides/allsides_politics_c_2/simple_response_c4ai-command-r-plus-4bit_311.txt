SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary under President Trump, issued a scathing critique of the White House's response to nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. In a rare break from military tradition of not speaking out against a sitting president, Mattis condemned Trump's handling of the protests, particularly the use of the military to suppress peaceful demonstrators. He accused Trump of abusing his executive authority and seeking to divide Americans rather than unite them. Mattis also criticized the characterization of American cities as a "battlespace," arguing that the military should only be used domestically in rare and specific circumstances. He praised the protesters for demanding equal justice and called for accountability for those who would make a mockery of the Constitution. In response, Trump dismissed Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." This exchange highlights a growing tension between the military and the president, with several former military leaders speaking out against Trump's divisive leadership and misuse of military power.
