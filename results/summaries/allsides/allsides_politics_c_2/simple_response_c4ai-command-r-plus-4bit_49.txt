SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, has issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the nationwide protests against racial injustice, accusing him of abusing his executive authority and seeking to divide Americans. Mattis, who resigned over policy differences with Trump in 2018, broke his silence due to his anger and dismay at recent events. He criticized the militarization of the response to peaceful protests, stating that the military should only be used domestically in rare circumstances at the request of state governors. Mattis denounced Trump's divisive leadership, arguing that he is the first president in his lifetime who does not attempt to unite the nation. He praised the protesters for demanding equal justice and called for accountability for those who mock the Constitution. Mattis' statement aligns with criticisms from other military leaders, who have spoken out against the use of the military to suppress demonstrations. Trump responded by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General."
