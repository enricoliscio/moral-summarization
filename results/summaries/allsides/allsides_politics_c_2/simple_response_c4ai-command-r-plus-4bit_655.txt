SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the nationwide protests, accusing him of abusing his executive authority and seeking to divide Americans. In an extraordinary statement, Mattis, a retired Marine general, said he was angered and appalled by the events of recent days, including the use of the National Guard to disperse peaceful protesters for a presidential photo op. He argued that the military should not be used to dominate American citizens and that the protests are defined by tens of thousands of people demanding equal justice under the law. Mattis also accused Trump of deliberately trying to divide the country and lacking mature leadership. He called for Americans to reject those in office who would make a mockery of the Constitution and to instead listen to Lincoln's "better angels." The rebuke is especially notable given the rarity of military leadership speaking out against a sitting president. The president responded by insulting Mattis as "the world's most overrated general."
