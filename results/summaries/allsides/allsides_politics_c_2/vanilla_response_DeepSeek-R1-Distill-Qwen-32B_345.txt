Alright, I need to summarize this article about Jim Mattis rebuking Trump. Let me read through it carefully.

So, Mattis is a retired Marine General who was Trump's defense secretary but resigned over policy disagreements. Now, he's criticizing Trump's handling of the nationwide protests. He's saying Trump is dividing Americans and militarizing the response, which is a big deal because military leaders rarely speak out against sitting presidents.

He mentions the incident where Trump cleared protesters for a photo op, calling it an abuse of authority. Mattis also opposes using the Insurrection Act, which would deploy the military domestically. Current Defense Secretary Esper agrees with Mattis on that point, which is notable.

Mattis emphasizes that the military should only be used when requested by state governors, not to dominate cities. He's upset about the protests being framed as a battlespace. He's also critical of Trump's overall leadership, saying he's the first president in Mattis's lifetime not to try uniting the country.

The article also mentions other military leaders speaking out, like Dempsey and Mullen, which adds context about the broader criticism. Trump responded by calling Mattis overrated, which is typical of his style.

I should make sure the summary captures Mattis's main points: his criticism of Trump's divisiveness, the military's role, the photo op incident, and the broader context of military leaders speaking out. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.
