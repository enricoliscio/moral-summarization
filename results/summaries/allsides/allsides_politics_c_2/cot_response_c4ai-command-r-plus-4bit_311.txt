SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary under President Trump, has issued a scathing critique of the administration's handling of recent protests and civil unrest across the nation. Mattis, who resigned from his post in 2018, broke his silence to condemn the President's divisive actions and rhetoric, stating that Trump has sought to divide Americans and abused his executive power. Mattis' rebuke comes after peaceful protesters were forcibly removed near the White House, clearing the way for Trump's controversial photo-op outside a church. The retired general emphasized the importance of respecting the Constitution and the role of the military, stating that America is not a battleground and our citizens are not the enemy. He called for unity and accountability, urging Americans to listen to their better angels and reject those who would make a mockery of our nation's values. Mattis' statement, along with similar criticisms from other military leaders, highlights the growing concern over the administration's response to the protests and the potential politicization of the armed forces. President Trump responded by attacking Mattis' character, but the damage of such a strong moral condemnation by a former defense secretary is hard to undo.
