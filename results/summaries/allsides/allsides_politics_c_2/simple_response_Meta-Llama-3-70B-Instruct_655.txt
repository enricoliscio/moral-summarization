SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, warning against "militarizing our response" to protests. Mattis, a retired Marine general, said Trump has sought to divide Americans and criticized the president's decision to use military force against peaceful protesters. Mattis called Trump's actions "an abuse of executive authority" and urged Americans to "reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution." Mattis's statement came after Trump threatened to deploy the military within the US and used law enforcement and the National Guard to "dominate" protesters. Mattis argued that the military should only be used in rare occasions and at the request of state governors. He also condemned Trump's divisive strategy, saying the president has failed to unite the American people. Mattis's critique was echoed by other senior military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen.
