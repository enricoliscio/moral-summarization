SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the nationwide protests, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and militarizing the response to the demonstrations. Mattis, a retired Marine general, said he was "angry and appalled" by the use of the National Guard to disperse peaceful protesters near the White House. He called the move an "abuse of executive authority" and criticized the characterization of American cities as a "battlespace." Mattis also condemned Trump's photo-op at St. John's Church, saying it showed "disdain for the rights of peaceful protest." He warned against using the military for domestic law enforcement, a view echoed by current Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Mattis' statement came as a surprise, as he has largely remained silent about Trump's presidency since resigning in 2018. Trump responded by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General."
