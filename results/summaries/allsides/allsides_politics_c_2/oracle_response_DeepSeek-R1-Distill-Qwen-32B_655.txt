Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Jim Mattis criticizing Trump's handling of the protests. Mattis, a former Defense Secretary, is concerned about the militarization and division. He uses strong moral terms like "unrest," "divide," "abuse," and "respect."

I should highlight Mattis's main points: the abuse of executive authority, the improper use of military, and the division of Americans. Also, mention Trump's response and Mattis's call for unity. I need to keep the morally charged words as much as possible without making it too long. Let me structure the summary to include Mattis's statement, his concerns, Trump's reaction, and the broader implications. Keeping it under 200 words is key. I'll make sure each sentence captures the essence of the moral arguments without losing the critical points.

SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has sharply criticized President Trump for his handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and militarizing the response to protests. Mattis, who resigned over policy differences, emphasized his oath to support and defend the Constitution, warning against using troops to violate citizens' rights or create a "bizarre photo op." He called Trump's actions "an abuse of executive authority," referencing the clearing of peaceful protesters near the White House. Mattis also opposed invoking the Insurrection Act, stating that the military should only be used when requested by state governors, not to "dominate" protests. He accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, noting that the president has not tried to unite the country and has instead exploited tensions. Mattis emphasized that the protests are a unifying demand for equal justice, urging accountability for those who mock the Constitution and calling for unity in upholding American values. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." END OF SUMMARY.
