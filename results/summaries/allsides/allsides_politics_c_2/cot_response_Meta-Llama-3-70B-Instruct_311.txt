SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis called Trump's actions "an abuse of executive authority" and a "bizarre photo op" that violated the Constitutional rights of citizens. He rejected the idea of viewing cities as a "battlespace" and urged respect for the military and fellow citizens. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying he is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Instead, Trump tries to divide us, and we are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. Mattis called for accountability and unity, urging Americans to remember their "better angels" and work towards a more wholesome and unifying response. END OF SUMMARY.
