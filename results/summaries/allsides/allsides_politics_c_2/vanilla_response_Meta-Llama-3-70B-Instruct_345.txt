SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a strong rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, saying Trump has sought to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis, who resigned from his post in 2018 over policy differences, criticized the use of military force to clear peaceful protesters from around the White House, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He also rejected the idea of viewing American cities as a "battlespace" that needs to be dominated by the military. Mattis' statement came as current Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposed invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military within the US. Mattis' criticism was echoed by other senior military leaders, including two former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen. Trump responded to Mattis' criticism by calling him "the world's most overrated General."
