SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis condemned the use of troops to clear peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority" and a "bizarre photo op" for the president. He warned against viewing American cities as a "battlespace" and urged respect for the Constitutional rights of fellow citizens. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying he is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Instead, Trump tries to divide us, and we are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. Mattis called for Americans to reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
