SUMMARY: In an extraordinary critique of the White House's handling of nationwide unrest, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's response to the protests. Mattis, a retired Marine General, accused Trump of seeking to divide Americans and warned against "militarizing our response" to the protests. He highlighted his own oath to support and defend the Constitution, stating that troops should never be ordered to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens. Mattis called the use of force to clear peaceful protesters for Trump's photo-op an "abuse of executive authority." He also rejected the idea of treating cities as a "battlespace," emphasizing that the military should only be used domestically in rare circumstances. Mattis' statement came as current Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposed invoking the Insurrection Act. Mattis further condemned Trump's divisive strategy, saying he does not try to unite the American people. The president responded by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General." Mattis' statement, along with criticism from other military leaders, underscores the growing tension between the military and the president over the response to the protests and the role of the military in domestic affairs.
