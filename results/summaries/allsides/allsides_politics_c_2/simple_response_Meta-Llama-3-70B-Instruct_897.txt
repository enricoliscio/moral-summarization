SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to protests. Mattis condemned the use of military force against peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He also criticized Trump's divisive strategy, saying the president is the first in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Mattis urged Americans to reject any thinking of their cities as a "battlespace" and to respect the Constitution and the rights of peaceful protesters. He also called for accountability for those in office who would make a mockery of the Constitution. Mattis's statement was echoed by other former military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen, who also condemned the use of the military to quash demonstrations.
