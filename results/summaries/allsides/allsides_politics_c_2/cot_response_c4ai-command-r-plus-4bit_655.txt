SUMMARY:
In an extraordinary rebuke of President Trump, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has criticized the administration's handling of the recent nationwide protests. Mattis, a retired Marine general, accused Trump of seeking to divide Americans and warned against militarizing the response to the protests. He emphasized his commitment to defending the Constitution and expressed outrage at the abuse of executive authority, specifically referring to the recent events where peaceful protesters were cleared for a presidential photo opportunity. Mattis joined other military leaders in condemning the use of the military to suppress demonstrations and rejecting the notion of treating American cities as a "battlespace." He also denounced Trump's divisive leadership style and praised the protesters for their unifying demand for equal justice under the law. The former defense secretary called for accountability and respect for the Constitution, invoking Lincoln's "better angels." President Trump responded by insulting Mattis and claiming he had fired him.
