SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. Mattis, a retired Marine general, accused Trump of seeking to divide Americans and warned against militarizing the response to the protests. He called the use of force to clear peaceful protesters near the White House an "abuse of executive authority" and said that the military should only be used domestically on rare occasions at the request of state governors. Mattis also criticized Trump for his photo-op at St. John's Church, stating that it demonstrated the president's "disdain for the rights of peaceful protest." The rebuke came on the same day that current Defense Secretary Mark Esper also distanced himself from Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act. Trump responded to Mattis' criticism by calling him "the world's most overrated General."
