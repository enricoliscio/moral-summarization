SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, issued a stunning rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, saying Trump has sought to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis called Monday's actions "an abuse of executive authority" and urged the country to "reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace'". He accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American peopleâ€” does not even pretend to try." Mattis emphasized the importance of upholding the Constitution and respecting the rights of peaceful protesters, saying "We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers" and "We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership". Mattis' critique was echoed by other senior military leaders, who condemned the use of the military to quash the demonstrations. END OF SUMMARY.
