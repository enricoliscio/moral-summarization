SUMMARY:
Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a stunning rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, saying Trump has sought to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis called Monday's actions "an abuse of executive authority" and rejected the idea of using the military to "dominate" protesters. He urged Americans to "reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace'" and to respect the Constitutional rights of fellow citizens. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American peopleâ€” does not even pretend to try." Instead, Trump tries to divide us, and we are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. Mattis called for Americans to remember Lincoln's "better angels" and work to unite. END OF SUMMARY.
