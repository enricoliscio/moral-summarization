SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, has issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the recent civil unrest. In a statement published in The Atlantic, Mattis condemned the White House's decision to clear peaceful protesters for a presidential photo op, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He accused Trump of seeking to divide Americans and warned against militarizing our response to the protests. Mattis, who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, emphasized that the military should not be used to dominate our fellow citizens but rather to protect them. He criticized the current administration for its lack of mature leadership and its failure to unite the American people. Mattis' statement comes amid nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd and the use of National Guard troops to disperse peaceful demonstrators. He highlighted the contrast between the divisive actions of the president and the unifying demands of the protesters for equal justice under the law. The response to the pandemic, Mattis noted, has shown the willingness of Americans to sacrifice for the safety of their community. He called for accountability for those who would make a mockery of the Constitution and urged Americans to listen to their better angels and work towards unity.
