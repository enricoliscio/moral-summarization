SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the nationwide protests, accusing him of dividing Americans and militarizing the response to the demonstrations. Mattis, a retired Marine general, said he was "angry and appalled" by the use of the National Guard to disperse peaceful protesters for Trump's photo-op outside a church. He criticized the characterization of the protests as a "battlespace" and emphasized that the military should only be used domestically in rare circumstances. Mattis also condemned Trump's failure to unite the country and his deliberate efforts to divide Americans. His rebuke was met with a dismissive response from Trump, who called Mattis "the world's most overrated General." The criticism from Mattis adds to implicit and explicit condemnation of Trump's actions from other military leaders, including current Defense Secretary Mark Esper and former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen. The protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd, have brought to light the long-standing racial injustices and tensions in the country.
