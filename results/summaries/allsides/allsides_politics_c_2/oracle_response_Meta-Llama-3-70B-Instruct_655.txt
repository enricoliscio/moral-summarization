SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to protests. Mattis condemned the use of military force to clear peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority" and a violation of the Constitutional rights of citizens. He also criticized Trump's photo-op at St. John's Church, saying it showed "disdain for the rights of peaceful protest" and risked politicizing the military. Mattis argued that the protests are a "wholesome and unifying demand" for equal justice under the law, and that Trump's divisive strategy has led to the current unrest. He urged Americans to "reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution" and to "unite" behind the values of justice and equality. Mattis's statement was joined by other former military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen, who also condemned the use of military force against protesters. END OF SUMMARY.
