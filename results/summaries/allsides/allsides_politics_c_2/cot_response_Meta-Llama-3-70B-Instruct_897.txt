SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and abusing executive authority. Mattis warned against "militarizing our response" to protests, calling it an "abuse of executive authority" and a "bizarre photo op" for Trump. He rejected the notion of treating American cities as a "battlespace" and urged respect for the Constitutional rights of fellow citizens. Mattis condemned Trump's divisive strategy, saying it was "wholesome and unifying" to demand equal justice under the law. He called for accountability and unity, invoking Lincoln's "better angels." Mattis's rare rebuke of a sitting president came as other senior military leaders also spoke out against Trump's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
