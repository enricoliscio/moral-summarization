SUMMARY: In a stunning rebuke of President Trump, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a statement criticizing the White House's handling of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. Mattis, a retired Marine General, accused Trump of seeking to divide Americans and warned against militarizing the response to the protests. He called the use of the military to clear peaceful protesters near the White House an "abuse of executive authority." Mattis also criticized the use of the term "battlespace" to describe the unrest and urged respect for fellow citizens, stating that America is not a battleground. He further accused Trump of deliberately dividing the country and lacking mature leadership. The statement comes as current Defense Secretary Mark Esper also distanced himself from Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act. Trump responded by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General."
END OF SUMMARY.
