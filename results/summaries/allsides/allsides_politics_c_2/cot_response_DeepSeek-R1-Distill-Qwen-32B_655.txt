Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Mattis rebuking Trump, but I also have to identify the morally framed words first. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about Mattis, a retired general, criticizing Trump's handling of the protests. He mentions that the military should not be used to "militarize" the response. That's a moral framing because it's about the right use of military force. He also talks about the Constitution and violating rights, which are moral issues related to governance and rights.

Mattis refers to the protests as "peaceful" and criticizes the clearing of protesters for a "photo op," which implies a misuse of power for personal gain. He uses words like "abuse" when talking about executive authority, showing disapproval of Trump's actions.

He also mentions "respect" for the military and condemns the idea of "dominating" protesters, which ties into moral values of respect and non-aggression. Mattis calls the use of the military in this context "dishonorable," another moral term.

The article also includes Mattis's statement about "equal justice" and "values," which are moral principles. He criticizes Trump for "dividing" the country, which is a moral failure in leadership. Mattis refers to the consequences of "three years without mature leadership," highlighting the moral duty of a leader.

Additionally, Mattis talks about the pandemic response, emphasizing "sacrifice" and "service," which are moral virtues. He urges accountability for those who "mock" the Constitution, another moral stance.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. I should structure it to highlight Mattis's main points: his criticism of Trump's use of military, the violation of constitutional rights, the peaceful nature of protests, the abuse of authority, the importance of unity, and respect for the military.

I should also mention Mattis's rare public criticism and Trump's response, but focus on the moral aspects. I'll need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too verbose.
