SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and militarizing the response to protests. Mattis warned against "militarizing our response" and "abuse of executive authority," citing the violation of Constitutional rights and the use of troops for a "bizarre photo op." He called Trump's actions an "abuse of executive authority" and said the president was pursuing a divisive strategy, trying to divide the American people instead of uniting them. Mattis emphasized the importance of respecting the rights of peaceful protesters and protecting fellow citizens, rather than treating them as enemies. He urged Americans to reject any thinking of their cities as a "battlespace" and to hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of the Constitution. Mattis's critique comes as a rare instance of military leadership speaking out against a sitting president, and his words carry significant moral weight.
