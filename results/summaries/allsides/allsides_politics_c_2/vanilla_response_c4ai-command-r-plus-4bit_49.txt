SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the nationwide protests, saying Trump has sought to divide Americans and warning against militarizing the response to the demonstrations. Mattis, a retired Marine general who resigned from the Trump administration in 2018, stated that he was "angry and appalled" by the use of National Guard troops to disperse peaceful protesters in Washington, D.C. He criticized Trump for not trying to unite the country and for treating American cities as a "battlespace." Mattis' statement came on the same day that current Defense Secretary Mark Esper also distanced himself from Trump's rhetoric. Trump responded to Mattis' criticism by calling him "the world's most overrated General." The rebuke from Mattis is a rare instance of military leadership speaking out against a sitting president.
