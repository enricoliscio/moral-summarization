Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about Jim Mattis, a former Defense Secretary under Trump, criticizing Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. Mattis is upset about the use of military force against peaceful protests and the way Trump has been dividing the country. He mentions the photo-op at the church and calls it an abuse of power. He also disagrees with the idea of using the military domestically, which he thinks should only be done in rare cases when requested by state governors.

Mattis contrasts this with how the military is meant to protect citizens and uphold the Constitution. He's upset because Trump is not uniting the country but dividing it, which he sees as a failure in leadership. Mattis also points out that the protests are about demanding equal justice, and while there's some violence, the majority are peaceful and driven by a desire to uphold national values.

I should highlight Mattis's main criticisms: the misuse of military, the division of the country, and the failure to uphold constitutional rights. Also, include Trump's response, calling Mattis overrated, to show the tension.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral stance against Trump's actions and the importance of unity and constitutional principles.
