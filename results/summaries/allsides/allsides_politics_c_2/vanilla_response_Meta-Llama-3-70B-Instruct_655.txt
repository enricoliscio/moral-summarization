SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, has issued a strong critique of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest. Mattis condemned the use of military force against peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He warned against "militarizing our response" to protests and said that the country's military should only be used when requested by state governors. Mattis also accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying that he is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Mattis' statement came after current Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposed invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military within the US. Other senior military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen, have also spoken out against the use of the military to quash demonstrations.
