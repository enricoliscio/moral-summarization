Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has given me a list of morally framed words that I should include in the summary. I should make sure to use as many of these words as possible without making the summary too long, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Jim Mattis, a former Defense Secretary, criticizing Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest, particularly the use of military force against protesters. Mattis condemns Trump for trying to divide the country and for militarizing the response. He mentions the oath to support the Constitution and criticizes the clearing of protesters for a photo op, calling it an abuse of authority. Mattis also opposes using the military domestically and supports the protesters' demand for justice. Trump responds negatively, calling Mattis overrated.

Now, I'll identify the key moral terms from the list that are central to the article: unrest, divide, militarizing, oath, support, defend, ordered, violate, cleared, abuse, threatened, use, dominate, called, deadly, bigotry, place, racism, risk, protect, respect, quash, disdain, rights, succor, strife, risked, politicizing, death, disperse, justice, unifying, demand, behind, vandalism, looting, live, pursuing, try, tries, effort, leadership, willing, sacrifice, safety, put, serve, accountable, mockery, unite.

I need to craft a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without it sounding forced. I'll focus on the main actions and criticisms, making sure to highlight Mattis's points and Trump's response.

I'll start by stating Mattis's rebuke of Trump's handling of unrest, then mention the division and militarization. I'll include the oath and the violation of rights, the clearing of protesters, and the abuse of authority. Then, I'll note Mattis's opposition to using the military domestically and his support for the protesters' demand for justice. I'll also include Trump's negative response, using some of the moral terms like 'disdain' and'mockery.' Finally, I'll tie it all together by emphasizing unity and accountability.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and isn't just a list of terms. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words and ensure that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sharply criticized President Trump for seeking to divide Americans and militarizing the response to nationwide unrest, calling it an abuse of executive authority. Mattis emphasized his oath to support and defend the Constitution, condemning the clearing of peaceful protesters for a photo op and the use of military force to "dominate" demonstrations. He warned against quashing protests, which he described as a unifying demand for justice, and opposed the idea of treating cities as a "battlespace." Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, unlike any leader in his lifetime, and criticized the administration for politicizing the military. He urged accountability for those mocking the Constitution and called for unity, rejecting racism, bigotry, and violence. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." Mattis's statement highlights the need to respect constitutional rights, protect citizens, and avoid treating fellow Americans as enemies. END OF SUMMARY.
