Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, the article is about Jim Mattis, the former Defense Secretary, criticizing Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. He's upset about the military being used in a way that violates constitutional rights, especially during the protests. Mattis emphasizes the importance of unity and rejecting the idea of treating cities as battlegrounds.

I should focus on the key points: Mattis's critique of Trump, the reference to the Constitution, the concern about militarizing the response, and his call for unity. Also, mention Trump's response, which is dismissive.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll start by stating Mattis's position and his main criticisms. Then, include Trump's reaction briefly. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like Mattis's emphasis on constitutional rights and unity.

Let me structure it: Introduction of Mattis's statement, his main arguments against Trump's actions, reference to the Constitution, mention of the photo-op incident, Mattis's call for rejecting military use at home, and Trump's criticism of Mattis. End with Mattis's points about unity and accountability.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that the moral framing is preserved, so focus on the values Mattis is emphasizing, like unity, respect for the military, and constitutional rights.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all the essential moral points.

SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has sharply criticized President Trump's handling of nationwide protests, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and militarizing the response to demonstrations. Mattis, in a statement published in *The Atlantic*, condemned Trump's use of military forces to clear peaceful protesters for a photo-op near the White House, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He emphasized that military troops swear an oath to defend the Constitution, not to violate citizens' rights. Mattis also rejected the idea of treating U.S. cities as "battlespaces" and stressed that the military should only be used domestically when requested by state governors. He criticized Trump for pursuing a divisive strategy, stating that the president has not attempted to unite the country and has instead exploited divisions. Mattis called the protests a "wholesome and unifying demand" for equal justice, urging the nation to focus on the peaceful majority rather than isolated acts of violence. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the worldâ€™s most overrated General." Mattis also highlighted the importance of unity and accountability, urging Americans to reject those who mock the Constitution and to focus on the nation's shared values. END OF SUMMARY.
