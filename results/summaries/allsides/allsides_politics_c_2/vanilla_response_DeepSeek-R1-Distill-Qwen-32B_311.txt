Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis rebuking Trump. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, Mattis, a former Defense Secretary, criticizes Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. He's upset about the use of military force against peaceful protesters and the photo op at the church. He mentions that using troops for such purposes is an abuse of authority.

I should note that Mattis hasn't spoken much about Trump since leaving his post, but the recent protests, especially after George Floyd's death, pushed him to speak up. He emphasizes that the military should only be used when requested by state governors, not for political photo ops.

Also, Mattis accuses Trump of dividing the country instead of uniting it, which is a significant point. Trump's response was to call Mattis overrated, which adds context about their past relationship.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements: Mattis's criticism, the context of the protests, his stance on military use, Trump's division strategy, and Trump's response.

I should structure it by starting with Mattis's rebuke, then the specifics of his criticism, his reasons for speaking now, the broader context of military leaders' rare criticism, and end with Trump's reaction.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I need to be clear and direct, avoiding unnecessary details. Make sure to highlight the key points without getting bogged down in specifics.
