SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a strong rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, saying Trump has sought to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis criticized the use of military force to clear peaceful protesters from around the White House, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He also rejected the idea of using the military to "dominate" protesters, saying it's the role of state governors to request military assistance in rare occasions. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying he's the first president in his lifetime who doesn't try to unite the American people. The statement marks a rare instance of military leadership speaking out against a sitting president. Mattis' criticism was echoed by other former military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen.
