SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary under President Trump, issued a scathing critique of the White House's handling of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. Mattis, who resigned over policy differences with Trump in 2018, accused the President of seeking to divide Americans and violating the Constitutional rights of citizens by clearing peaceful protesters for a photo opportunity. He warned against "militarizing our response" and condemned the use of the military to quell demonstrations, stating that America is not a battleground and our citizens are not the enemy. Mattis emphasized the importance of unifying around equal justice and respecting the sacrifice of those serving their community during the pandemic. He called for accountability for those who make a mockery of the Constitution and urged Americans to unite and listen to their better angels. Trump responded by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General."
