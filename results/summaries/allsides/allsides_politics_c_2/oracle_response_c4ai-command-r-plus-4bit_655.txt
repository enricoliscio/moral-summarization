SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and militarizing the response to the protests. In an extraordinary statement, Mattis, a retired Marine general, said that he swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution and that ordering troops to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens was an abuse of executive authority. He rejected the idea of treating American cities as a battlespace and called for rejecting any thinking that sees fellow citizens as the enemy. Mattis also condemned the use of the military to quash demonstrations and criticized Trump for pursuing a divisive strategy that does not try to unite the American people. He accused the president of showing disdain for the rights of peaceful protest and risking politicizing the armed forces. Mattis' statement came after current Defense Secretary Mark Esper also opposed invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy the military within the United States. The president responded by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated general."
