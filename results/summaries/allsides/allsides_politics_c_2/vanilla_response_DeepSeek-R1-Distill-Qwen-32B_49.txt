Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis criticizing Trump. Let me read through the article first. 

So, Mattis is a retired Marine general who was Trump's defense secretary but resigned over policy differences. Now, he's criticizing Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest, especially the use of military in Washington. He mentions the Constitution and how troops shouldn't be used to violate citizens' rights, referencing the photo op at the church. Mattis also talks about Trump's divisive strategy and the misuse of military terms like "battlespace." 

Current Defense Secretary Esper also opposes using the Insurrection Act. Mattis is rare in criticizing the president, but others like Dempsey and Mullen have too. Mattis emphasizes that the military should only be used when requested by state governors. He's upset about the protests over George Floyd and the use of National Guard. He believes the protests are about equal justice and condemns the president's division. Trump responds by calling Mattis overrated. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Mattis's criticism, mention the photo op and Constitution, Esper's stance, Mattis's rare criticism, others' condemnations, the focus on equal justice, Trump's division, and Trump's response. Keep it concise, making sure all key points are included without getting too detailed.
