SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, has issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, saying Trump has sought to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis condemned the use of military force to clear peaceful protesters from around the White House, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He also rejected the idea of using the military to "dominate" protesters, saying it's the job of law enforcement and the National Guard to maintain order. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying he's the first president in his lifetime who doesn't try to unite the American people. Mattis' statement came after current Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposed invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military within the US. Mattis' rare rebuke of a sitting president has been joined by other senior military leaders, including two former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen.
