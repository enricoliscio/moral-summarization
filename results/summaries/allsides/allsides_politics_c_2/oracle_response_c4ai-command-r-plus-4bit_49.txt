SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary under President Trump, has issued a scathing critique of the White House's response to the nationwide unrest. In an extraordinary statement, Mattis accused Trump of seeking to divide Americans and warned against "militarizing our response" to the protests. He called the president's actions an "abuse of executive authority" and a violation of the Constitutional rights of citizens. Mattis's rebuke came as current Defense Secretary Mark Esper also distanced himself from Trump's threats to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy the military to quell the protests. Mattis emphasized that the military should not view American cities as a "battlespace" and that troops should only be used domestically in rare circumstances at the request of state governors. He expressed anger and appall at the death of George Floyd and supported the demands for equal justice and unity among Americans. Mattis accused Trump of deliberately pursuing a divisive strategy and lacking mature leadership. The president responded by insulting Mattis and claiming he had fired him. In his statement, Mattis called for Americans to reject those in office who would make a mockery of the Constitution and instead unite under Lincoln's "better angels."
