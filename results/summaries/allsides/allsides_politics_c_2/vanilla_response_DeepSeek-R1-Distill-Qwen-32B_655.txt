Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Jim Mattis rebuking Trump. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article begins by introducing Mattis, a retired Marine General and former Defense Secretary under Trump. He resigned nearly a year and a half ago due to policy disagreements. Now, he's criticizing Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, specifically the use of military forces in response to protests.

Mattis's statement in The Atlantic is a key part. He talks about his oath to defend the Constitution and expresses concern that troops might be used to violate citizens' rights, referencing the clearing of protesters for Trump's photo op at a church. He calls this an abuse of executive authority.

Current Defense Secretary Mark Esper also opposes using the Insurrection Act, which Mattis supports, stating the military should only be used when requested by state governors. Mattis criticizes Trump for dividing the country and failing to unite, which he sees as a consequence of three years of such leadership.

The article mentions other military leaders like Dempsey and Mullen who have also condemned the use of the military against protesters. Mattis, who hasn't spoken much about Trump since leaving office, was moved to speak due to the protests over George Floyd's death and the use of the National Guard.

Trump responds by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General," a reference to past criticisms.

So, the summary needs to capture Mattis's main points: his criticism of Trump's divisive tactics, the misuse of military, the importance of unity, and the response from Trump. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I'll start by introducing Mattis and his criticism. Then, mention the specific incidents he refers to, such as the photo op and the Insurrection Act. Include his stance on military use and the impact of Trump's leadership. Finally, note Trump's response.

I should avoid going into too much detail about other military leaders unless it's essential. The focus is on Mattis's critique and its implications.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and flows logically.
