SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis condemned the use of military force to clear peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority" and a violation of the Constitutional rights of citizens. He urged Americans to reject the notion of using the military to "dominate" protesters, instead advocating for a unified response to the demands for equal justice under the law. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying he is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. He called for accountability from those in office who would make a mockery of the Constitution and for Americans to listen to their "better angels" as they work to unite. Mattis's rare public criticism of a sitting president is a powerful moral indictment of Trump's leadership.
