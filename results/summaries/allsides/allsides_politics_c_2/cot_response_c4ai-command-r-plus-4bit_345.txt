SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary under President Trump, issued a scathing critique of the administration's handling of the recent nationwide protests. In a statement, Mattis denounced the use of the military to suppress peaceful protests, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He emphasized the importance of respecting the Constitution and the unifying nature of the protests, demanding equal justice under the law. Mattis accused Trump of deliberately dividing Americans and lacking mature leadership. The critique comes amid growing criticism from military leaders, including former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmen, who condemned the militarization of the response to protests. Mattis' statement highlights the moral duty to "reject" such actions and uphold the values of unity and sacrifice, warning against making a "mockery" of the Constitution. He calls on Americans to listen to their "better angels" and work towards unity. END OF SUMMARY.
