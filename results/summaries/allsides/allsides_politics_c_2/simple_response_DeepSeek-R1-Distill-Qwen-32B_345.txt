Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis rebuking Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about Mattis, a former Defense Secretary, criticizing Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. He's upset about the use of military force and Trump's divisiveness. Mattis mentions his oath to the Constitution and how using troops for photo ops is wrong. He also criticizes the idea of treating cities as battlegrounds and urges using the military only when requested by states.

I should highlight Mattis's main criticisms: the abuse of executive authority, the militarization of protests, and Trump's divisive strategy. Also, mention Mattis's rare public criticism and the context of his past silence. Trump's response is a counterpoint, calling Mattis overrated.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential points without too much detail. The moral framing is about unity, respecting the Constitution, and proper use of military force. I'll make sure to include Mattis's statements about the protesters' demands for justice and the consequences of Trump's actions.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture Mattis's strong rebuke, the specific criticisms, and the underlying moral stance against division and misuse of military power. I'll structure it to flow logically from Mattis's critique to the implications and Trump's response.
