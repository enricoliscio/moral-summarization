SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis condemned the use of military force to clear peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority" and a violation of the Constitutional rights of citizens. He also criticized Trump's photo-op at St. John's Church, saying it showed "disdain for the rights of peaceful protest" and risked politicizing the military. Mattis urged Americans to reject a "battlespace" mentality and instead work towards unity, saying the protests were a "wholesome and unifying demand" for equal justice under the law. He accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, saying he was the first president in his lifetime who didn't try to unite the American people. Mattis called for Americans to respect and protect each other, and to hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of the Constitution.
