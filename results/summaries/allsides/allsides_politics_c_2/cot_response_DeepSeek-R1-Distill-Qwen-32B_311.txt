Okay, so I need to help this user who's asking for a summary of a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the morally framed single words. Let me break this down.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about former Defense Secretary Mattis criticizing Trump's handling of protests. Mattis talks about unity, constitutional rights, and condemns the use of military against citizens. There's also mention of other military leaders speaking out, and Trump's response.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral implications. I'll go through the article and pick out words that express values or judgments. Words like "stunning rebuke," "divided," "militarizing," "abuse," "executive authority," "battlespace," "dominate," "disdain," "politicizing," "unite," "consequences," "mature leadership," "sacrifice," "mockery," "better angels." These all seem to carry moral weight.

Next, the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these moral words as possible. I'll start by introducing Mattis and his criticism. Then mention the specific incidents he refers to, like the photo op and the use of military. Include his points about the military's role and the division Trump is causing. Also, note the rare occurrence of military leaders speaking out and Trump's response. Finally, highlight Mattis's call for unity and accountability.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral points without getting too bogged down in details. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each paragraph covers a main point: Mattis's criticism, the specifics of his arguments, other military leaders' stances, Trump's reaction, and Mattis's concluding message.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise and includes all the necessary moral terms.

### SUMMARY:  
Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a sharp rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide protests, criticizing the militarization of the response and Trump's efforts to divide Americans. Mattis, who resigned over policy differences, condemned the use of troops to clear peaceful protesters for a photo op, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He emphasized the military's role to defend the Constitution, not to "dominate" citizens. Mattis also criticized Trump for pursuing a divisive strategy, stating he is the first president in Mattis's lifetime not to unite the country. Other military leaders, including former Joint Chiefs chairmen, echoed Mattis's concerns, calling America "not a battleground." Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the worldâ€™s most overrated General." Mattis urged accountability for those mocking the Constitution and called for unity, highlighting the sacrifices of frontline workers during the pandemic. He concluded by appealing to Lincoln's "better angels" to heal the nation.  
END OF SUMMARY.
