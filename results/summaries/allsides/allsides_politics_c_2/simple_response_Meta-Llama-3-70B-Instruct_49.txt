SUMMARY:

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of nationwide protests, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the demonstrations. Mattis condemned the use of troops to clear peaceful protesters from around the White House, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He also rejected the notion of viewing American cities as a "battlespace" that the military should "dominate." Mattis, who resigned as defense secretary over policy differences with Trump, said the president's actions have been divisive and that the country needs to unite behind the values of equal justice under the law. He was joined by other former military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen, who also spoke out against the use of the military to quash protests. Trump responded to Mattis' criticism by calling him "the world's most overrated General."
