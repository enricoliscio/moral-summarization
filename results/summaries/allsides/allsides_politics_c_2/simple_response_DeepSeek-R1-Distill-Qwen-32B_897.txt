Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Jim Mattis rebuking Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points. Mattis, a former Defense Secretary, is criticizing Trump's handling of the protests, specifically the use of military force and the division of the country. He mentions the oath to the Constitution and the misuse of troops for political photo ops. Mattis also talks about the pandemic response and calls for accountability. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral stance against dividing the nation and militarizing the response. Also, include Mattis's points about the military's role and the importance of unity. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, ending with the required tokens. I should avoid any markdown and keep it straightforward.

SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has strongly criticized President Trump's handling of nationwide protests, accusing him of dividing Americans and militarizing the response. Mattis, in a statement published in *The Atlantic*, condemned Trump's use of troops for political photo ops, such as clearing peaceful protesters near the White House, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He emphasized the military's role is to protect constitutional rights, not to dominate domestic spaces. Mattis also criticized Trump for failing to unite the country, unlike any president in his lifetime, and warned against the consequences of such division. Current Defense Secretary Mark Esper opposed invoking the Insurrection Act, while Mattis urged respecting the military's role and avoiding the "battlespace" mentality. Mattis highlighted the protests as a demand for equal justice, urging accountability for those undermining the Constitution and emphasizing the need for unity. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." END OF SUMMARY.
