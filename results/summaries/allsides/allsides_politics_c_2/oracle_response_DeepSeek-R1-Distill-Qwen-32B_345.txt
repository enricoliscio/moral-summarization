Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about retired Marine General Jim Mattis criticizing President Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. Mattis resigned over policy differences and now speaks out against Trump's actions, like clearing protesters for a photo op. He uses strong moral terms like "abuse of executive authority" and "militarizing the response." Mattis emphasizes the Constitution and the role of the military, saying they shouldn't be used to dominate citizens. He also condemns Trump's divisiveness and the potential politicization of the military. Other military leaders, like Dempsey and Mullen, agree, while Trump dismisses Mattis.

I need to include as many of the author's morally framed words as possible. Words like "unrest," "divide," "militarizing," "oath," "abuse," "dominate," "rights," "disdain," "respect," "quash," "justice," "unifying," "sacrifice," "respect," "accountable," "mockery," "unite" are key.

I should structure the summary to highlight Mattis's main criticisms, the context of the protests, the military's role, and the broader implications of Trump's actions. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, ensuring it flows logically and includes the necessary moral terms.

Let me start by introducing Mattis's rebuke, then outline his arguments about the Constitution and military misuse. I'll mention the photo op incident, Trump's divisiveness, and the reactions from other military leaders. Finally, I'll note Trump's response to Mattis's criticism.

I need to make sure each sentence captures the moral framing without being too verbose. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the language reflects the original article's tone.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis sharply criticized President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and militarizing the response to protests. Mattis, who resigned as defense secretary over policy differences, emphasized his oath to support and defend the Constitution, warning against using troops to violate citizens' rights or create a "bizarre photo op." He condemned Trump's actions as an abuse of executive authority, referencing the clearance of peaceful protesters near the White House. Mattis opposed the use of the Insurrection Act and criticized the idea of treating cities as a "battlespace" to be dominated by the military. He called for unity and respect for the military's role in protecting citizens, not quashing protests. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy and failing to provide mature leadership, while other military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen, echoed his concerns. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." Mattis emphasized the importance of upholding constitutional rights and urged accountability for those who mock the Constitution, urging Americans to unite and live up to their values. END OF SUMMARY.
