SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, former Defense Secretary, has issued a scathing critique of President Trump's handling of nationwide unrest, accusing him of seeking to divide Americans and warning against "militarizing our response" to the protests. Mattis condemned the use of military force against peaceful protesters, calling it an "abuse of executive authority" and a violation of Constitutional rights. He also rejected the notion of viewing American cities as a "battlespace" and urged respect for the military and the rights of citizens. Mattis, who resigned from the Trump administration in 2018, broke his silence to speak out against the president's divisive strategy, saying Trump is the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people. Mattis's statement was echoed by other former military leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey and Adm. Mike Mullen, who also condemned the use of military force against protesters.
