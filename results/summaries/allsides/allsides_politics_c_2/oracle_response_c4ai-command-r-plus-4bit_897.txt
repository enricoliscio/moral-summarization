SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued a scathing rebuke of President Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. In an extraordinary statement, Mattis accused Trump of seeking to divide Americans and criticized the militarization of the response to the protests. He highlighted his oath to support and defend the Constitution and condemned the violation of peaceful protesters' Constitutional rights, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." Mattis also disagreed with the current defense secretary's use of the term "battlespace" and Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act. He emphasized that the military should only be used domestically in rare circumstances at the request of state governors. Mattis' statement came after days of protest over the death of George Floyd and the use of National Guard troops to disperse peaceful demonstrators. He accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy and trying to divide Americans. The president responded by calling Mattis "the world's most overrated General." Mattis' statement emphasized the need to respect the Constitution, protect citizens' rights, and hold accountable those who make a mockery of our values.
