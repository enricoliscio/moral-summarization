Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Gen. Mattis criticizing Trump's handling of protests. 

I should identify the morally charged words as per the user's instructions. Words like "abuse," "unite," "respect," "sacrifice," "accountable," etc., stand out. These words carry strong moral connotations and are crucial for the summary.

Next, I need to create a concise summary that includes these words. I'll start by noting Mattis's rebuke, his emphasis on unity, and the constitutional values. I should mention the specific criticisms about the military's role and the photo op, as well as Mattis's respect for the troops.

I also need to include Trump's response and Mattis's broader points about leadership and values. Keeping the summary under 200 words is important, so I'll make sure each sentence is impactful and includes the key moral terms.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Mattis's critique, moving through specific criticisms, and ending with the call to unity and accountability. This approach ensures the moral framing is preserved and the summary is clear and concise.

Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis harshly criticized President Trump for dividing Americans and militarizing the response to nationwide protests, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." Mattis emphasized the importance of unity and respect for constitutional rights, warning against using the military to "dominate" peaceful protesters. He criticized Trump's photo op at St. John's Church, stating it disrespected the rights of peaceful protest and politicized the military. Mattis accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, unlike any leader in his lifetime, and warned of the consequences of three years of such leadership. He highlighted the sacrifices of troops and civilians during the pandemic, urging accountability for those mocking the Constitution and a return to unity. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." Mattis stressed the need to focus on the "wholesome and unifying" demands of the protests, rejecting the distraction of lawbreakers and calling for a return to shared values.
