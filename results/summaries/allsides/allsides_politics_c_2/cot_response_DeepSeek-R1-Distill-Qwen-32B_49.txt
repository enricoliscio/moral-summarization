Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the task. The user wants me to identify all single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, write a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about Mattis criticizing Trump's handling of protests. The key points are Mattis's concerns about the military's role, the use of the Insurrection Act, and Trump's divisiveness. I need to extract the morally charged words.

In STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral weight. Words like "abuse," "divisive," "respect," "sacrifice," "unite," "disdain," etc. I'll list each on a new line with an asterisk.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral language intact. I'll start by stating Mattis's criticism, mention the specific events like the photo op, his concerns about militarizing the response, and Trump's reaction. I'll also include Mattis's points about unity and the consequences of Trump's actions.

I should ensure the summary flows well and includes the main moral arguments without getting bogged down in details. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens and keep the language clear and concise.

Finally, I'll review both steps to make sure all morally framed words are included and the summary accurately reflects Mattis's stance while preserving the moral tone.

**SUMMARY:**  

Retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, a former Defense Secretary under Trump, has strongly criticized the president's handling of nationwide protests, calling it "an abuse of executive authority." Mattis condemned the militarization of the response to protests, stating that troops should not be used to "provide a bizarre photo op" for the president, as seen during Trump's visit to St. John's Church. He accused Trump of pursuing a divisive strategy, unlike any president in his lifetime, and warned against using the military to "dominate" protests. Mattis emphasized the importance of unity and respect for constitutional rights, urging accountability for those who mock the Constitution. He also highlighted the sacrifices of frontline workers during the pandemic. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." Mattis's critique reflects a broader military opposition to Trump's approach, with other leaders also condemning the use of the military in domestic protests. Mattis urged the nation to focus on unity and uphold its values, rejecting the idea of treating cities as a "battlespace."
