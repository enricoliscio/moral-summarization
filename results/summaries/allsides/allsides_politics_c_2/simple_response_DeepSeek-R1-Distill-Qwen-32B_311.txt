Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Jim Mattis, a former Defense Secretary, criticizing Trump's handling of the nationwide unrest. Mattis is upset about the use of military force against peaceful protesters and Trump's photo-op at the church. He mentions that this is an abuse of executive authority and goes against the Constitution. He's emphasizing unity and rejecting the idea of treating cities as battlegrounds.

I should note that Mattis is a respected military figure, so his criticism carries weight. The moral framing here is about upholding constitutional values, rejecting division, and respecting the military's role. Mattis is highlighting the importance of unity and the dangers of militarizing domestic responses.

I need to make sure the summary captures Mattis's key points: the abuse of authority, the constitutional rights, the rejection of treating cities as battlegrounds, and the call for unity. Also, mention Trump's response as it adds context to the criticism.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce Mattis's criticism, then detail his main concerns, and conclude with Trump's reaction. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, and ensuring the moral aspects are clear.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has strongly criticized President Trump's handling of nationwide protests, accusing him of dividing Americans and militarizing the response. Mattis, in a statement published in *The Atlantic*, condemned Trump's use of military forces to clear peaceful protesters for a photo-op, calling it an "abuse of executive authority." He emphasized that the military's role is to protect constitutional rights, not to violate them or serve political ends. Mattis also criticized Trump for treating cities as "battlespaces" and urged against using the military domestically without state requests. He highlighted the protesters' demand for equal justice and warned against Trump's divisive leadership, which he said has weakened national unity. Mattis's critique, rare for a military leader, underscores the importance of upholding constitutional values and rejecting the militarization of domestic affairs. Trump responded by dismissing Mattis as "the world's most overrated General." END OF SUMMARY.
