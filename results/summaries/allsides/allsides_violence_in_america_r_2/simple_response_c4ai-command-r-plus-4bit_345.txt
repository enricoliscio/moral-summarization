SUMMARY: The massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue is a tragedy and a unique American tragedy. It marks the first time Jews have been murdered for being Jewish in the United States, adding America to the list of countries where this has occurred. While any loss of life is tragic, there is something distinct about the murder of Jews due to the exterminationist nature of anti-Semitism. The author emphasizes the destructive impact of anti-Semitism on societies throughout history, using Nazi Germany as an example. They express skepticism about claims of increased anti-Semitism in America, citing the biased agendas of some Jewish organizations and media outlets. The author also refutes the notion that President Trump is to blame for the Pittsburgh massacre or an increase in anti-Semitism, noting his pro-Israel stance and close connections with Jews. Instead, the threat of Jewish annihilation comes from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. The author concludes by highlighting the uniqueness of America, where Jews have traditionally not required armed guards in synagogues, and emphasizes the importance of fighting anti-Semitism for the sake of both Jews and the nation as a whole.
