SUMMARY: In the wake of the tragic massacre of Jews in Pittsburgh, this article serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat of anti-Semitism. The author, a Jew who has fought anti-Semitism for decades, laments the destruction of Jewish lives and the infiltration of hatred into the very fabric of American society. The article highlights the unique nature of anti-Semitism, which seeks not just to persecute or enslave Jews, but to annihilate them entirely. The author decries the left-wing media and Jewish organizations for their dishonesty in blaming Trump for increasing anti-Semitism, when in reality, the Pittsburgh murderer criticized Trump's pro-Israel stance. The article also underscores the role of the left in perpetuating anti-Semitism, particularly on college campuses. The author fervently prays and advocates for the continued uniqueness of America, where synagogues have been safeguarded without the need for armed guards. The article concludes with a powerful appeal to fight anti-Semitism, not just for the sake of Jews, but for the love of America itself, as the fate of the nation is intertwined with the treatment of its Jewish citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
