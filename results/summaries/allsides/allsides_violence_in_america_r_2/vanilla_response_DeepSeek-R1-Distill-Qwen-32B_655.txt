Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The author is a Jewish American who's spent a lot of time fighting anti-Semitism. He starts by saying that Jews in America are the luckiest, but the Pittsburgh massacre changed things. It's a unique tragedy because it's the first time Jews were killed in America just for being Jewish. He explains that anti-Semitism is about annihilating Jews, not just persecuting them. He references the Haggadah, which talks about annihilation in every generation. 

He also connects anti-Semitism to historical events, like Hitler and the Holocaust, showing how it destroys societies. He mentions that while some organizations claimed anti-Semitism increased after Trump's election, it turned out to be mostly false. He's critical of left-wing groups and media for their dishonesty. He points out that the Pittsburgh shooter criticized Trump for being close to Jews and Israel. 

The author believes that anti-Semitism is increasing on the left, especially on college campuses, and that the real threats to Jews come from Iran and Arab countries. He hopes synagogues won't need armed guards and emphasizes the importance of fighting anti-Semitism for the sake of America. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the uniqueness of the Pittsburgh massacre, anti-Semitism's goal of annihilation, historical context, the false claims about anti-Semitism increasing, criticism of left-wing groups, the real threats from Iran and Arab countries, and the hope for synagogues to remain safe without guards. I should also mention the author's advocacy for fighting anti-Semitism for both Jews and America's sake.

SUMMARY: The author, a Jewish American activist against anti-Semitism, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique tragedy as it marks the first time Jews were killed in America for being Jewish. Anti-Semitism, he argues, seeks the annihilation of Jews, as seen in the shooter's cry, "All Jews must die." This aligns with the ancient Jewish belief that in every generation, Jew-haters arise to destroy Jews. The author connects anti-Semitism to historical devastation, such as the Holocaust, which decimated Jewish communities and societies. He critiques claims of rising anti-Semitism post-Trump, citing false alarms, including bomb threats traced to a disturbed individual. The author accuses left-wing groups of dishonesty and notes that the Pittsburgh shooter criticized Trump for his pro-Israel stance. He observes that anti-Semitism is growing on the left, particularly on college campuses, while the real threat to Jews comes from Iran and Arab enemies. The author hopes synagogues won't need armed guards and urges fighting anti-Semitism to protect both Jews and America's values. END OF SUMMARY.
