SUMMARY: The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, the greatest massacre of Jews in American history, is a unique tragedy that marks America as the latest country in which Jews have been *murdered* for being Jewish. While the loss of life and suffering of loved ones is unbearable, what makes this act of *antisemitism* particularly heinous is its *exterminationist* nature. Anti-semites aim not just to *persecute*, *enslave* or *expel* Jews, but to annihilate them. This hatred has destructive consequences for any society in which it takes root, as seen in the case of Nazi Germany. The author questions the reliability of some Jewish organizations and media outlets in assessing the rise of antisemitism in America, citing a previous incident where they falsely attributed an increase in bomb threats to the Trump administration. The true source of growing antisemitism in America, the author argues, is the left, and the greatest threat to Jewish annihilation comes from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. The author concludes with a fervent prayer that American synagogues will remain safe and free from the need for armed guards, and calls on all Americans, regardless of their feelings towards Jews, to fight antisemitism for the sake of the nation.
END OF SUMMARY.
