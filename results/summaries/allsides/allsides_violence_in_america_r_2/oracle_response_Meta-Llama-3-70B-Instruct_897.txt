SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish expert on anti-Semitism, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a "unique American tragedy" and a "painful" reminder that Jews are no longer safe in America. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is "exterminationist," seeking to "annihilate" Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author notes that anti-Semitism "destroys every society in which it grows," citing Nazi Germany as an example, where Jew-hatred was the "raison d'Ãªtre." He criticizes Jewish organizations and media outlets for spreading false claims of increased anti-Semitism, and instead blames the left for the rise in anti-Semitic incidents. The author, who attends synagogue every Shabbat, prays that armed guards will not be needed in American synagogues and urges Americans to "fight anti-Semites" to protect the nation's values. He concludes that as Jews go, so goes the fate of the nation in which they live.
