SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, acknowledging it as a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, the attack marks a painful milestone. The author highlights the distinct nature of anti-Semitism, which seeks to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or expel them. This hatred destroys societies, as seen in Nazi Germany, where anti-Semitism was the raison d'Ãªtre. The author questions the accuracy of reported anti-Semitism increases in America, citing biased sources and false claims. Instead, they argue that the greatest threat to Jews comes from the left, particularly on college campuses, and from Israel's enemies. The author concludes that fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for America's well-being, as the fate of Jews is tied to the nation's fate. They hope that armed guards will not be needed in American synagogues, preserving America's uniqueness.
