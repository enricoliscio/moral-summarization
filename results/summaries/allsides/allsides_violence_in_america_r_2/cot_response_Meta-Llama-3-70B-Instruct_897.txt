SUMMARY:
The author reflects on the massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, calling it a unique American tragedy. As a Jew and an American, the author finds it painful that the US has joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews. The author emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author also notes that anti-Semitism destroys every society in which it grows, citing the example of Nazi Germany. The author criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for spreading false claims of increased anti-Semitism, and instead blames the left for the rise of anti-Semitism in the last decade. The author concludes that fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the fate of America itself. END OF SUMMARY.
