SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy and a painful reminder that anti-Semitism has finally reached America. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author cites the Haggadah, which states "In every generation, they arise to annihilate us." He notes that anti-Semitism destroys every society in which it grows, as seen in Nazi Germany, where Jew-hatred was the raison d'Ãªtre.

The author questions the credibility of Jewish organizations and media outlets, which he believes have a left-wing, anti-Trump agenda. He argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left, citing the experiences of young Jews on college campuses. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of fighting anti-Semitism, not just for the sake of Jews, but for the fate of the nation itself.
