SUMMARY:
The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, the greatest massacre of Jews in American history, is a unique American tragedy. It marks the first time Jews have been murdered for being Jewish in the United States. The author, a Jew who has fought anti-Semitism all his life, reflects on the painful reality of this event and the enduring threat of anti-Semitism. He highlights the uniqueness of anti-Semitism as an exterminationist ideology that seeks to annihilate Jews, citing the murderer's cry of "All Jews must die." The author also discusses the destructive nature of anti-Semitism for societies, using Nazi Germany as an example. He criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for blaming the increase in anti-Semitism on Trump without evidence and for their silence after it was revealed that a mentally disturbed individual was behind most of the bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers. The author argues that Trump is the most pro-Israel president since Truman and that the real threat to Jews comes from the left and from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. He prays that armed guards will not be needed at American synagogues, as this would diminish America's uniqueness. The article concludes with an appeal to fight anti-Semitism to protect both Jews and the nation.
