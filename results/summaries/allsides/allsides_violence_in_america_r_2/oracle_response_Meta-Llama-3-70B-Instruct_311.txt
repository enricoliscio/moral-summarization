SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, calling it a unique American tragedy. As a Jew and an American, the author finds it painful that the US has joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews. The author emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, seeking to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author cites the Haggadah, which says "In every generation, they arise to annihilate us." The author also notes that anti-Semitism destroys every society in which it grows, citing the example of Nazi Germany. The author criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for crying "anti-Semitic fire" and blaming Trump for increased anti-Semitism, which is a falsehood. Instead, the author argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of fighting anti-Semitism, not just for Jews, but for the nation as a whole.
