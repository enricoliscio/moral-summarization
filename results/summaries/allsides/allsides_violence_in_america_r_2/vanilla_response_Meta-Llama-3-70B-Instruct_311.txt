SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, the attack marks a painful turning point. The author notes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. He cites the Haggadah, which says "In every generation, they arise to annihilate us." The author also argues that anti-Semitism destroys the societies in which it grows, citing Nazi Germany as an example. He questions the accuracy of reports on increasing anti-Semitism in America, suggesting that some organizations have a left-wing agenda. The author believes that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left and that the threat to Jewish annihilation comes from Israel's enemies. He concludes by emphasizing the importance of fighting anti-Semitism to protect America's values.
