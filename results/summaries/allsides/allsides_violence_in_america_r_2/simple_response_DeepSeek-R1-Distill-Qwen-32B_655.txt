Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The author is a Jewish American who's spent his life fighting anti-Semitism. He's written a book on it and has a background in Jewish history. He mentions the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it the worst in American history. He points out that while America is unique in offering safety to Jews, this tragedy shows it's not immune. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism isn't just persecution but aims to annihilate Jews, citing the Haggadah and the Pittsburgh shooter's statement.

He also talks about how anti-Semitism destroyed Germany, leading to massive losses. He criticizes some Jewish organizations for being biased against Trump, questioning their credibility. He argues that anti-Semitism has increased on the left, affecting young Jews on campuses. He ends by advocating for vigilance and the importance of protecting synagogues without armed guards, tying the fate of Jews to the nation's well-being.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points succinctly, highlighting the moral aspects like the uniqueness of anti-Semitism and the societal impact. I'll keep it under 200 words, focusing on the key arguments and the author's perspective.
