SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, acknowledging that it is a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, the attack is a painful reminder that America has joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews. The author emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill Jews, not just persecute or expel them. He also notes that anti-Semitism destroys every society it grows in, citing the Nazi regime as an example. The author criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for spreading false claims of increased anti-Semitism, and instead argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left. He concludes that fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the well-being of America itself, as the fate of the nation is tied to the fate of its Jewish population.
