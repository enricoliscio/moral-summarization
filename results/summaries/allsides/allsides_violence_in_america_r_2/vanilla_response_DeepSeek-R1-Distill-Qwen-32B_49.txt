Alright, I need to summarize this article. The user provided a detailed news piece, and I have to condense it into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The author is a Jewish American who has written about anti-Semitism and has a background in fighting it. He mentions the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre as a significant event. He argues that while America is unique in providing a safe haven for Jews, anti-Semitism is still a threat. He distinguishes anti-Semitism from other forms of hatred, emphasizing that it's about extermination.

He also talks about the historical impact of anti-Semitism, referencing Hitler and the Holocaust. He criticizes some Jewish organizations and media for dishonest reporting, using the example of bomb threats that were later found to be false. He points out that anti-Semitism has increased on the left, particularly on college campuses, and mentions threats from Iran and Arab groups.

The author supports the idea of arming synagogues but hopes it's unnecessary. He urges fighting anti-Semitism not just for Jews but for the sake of America, as the fate of the nation is tied to how it treats its Jewish community.

I need to capture all these points succinctly. I'll start by stating the author's main argument, mention the Pittsburgh attack, the nature of anti-Semitism, the historical context, the critique of organizations, the rise on the left, threats from abroad, and the conclusion about the importance of fighting anti-Semitism for the nation's sake.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is included without going into too much detail.
