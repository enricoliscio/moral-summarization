The author also discusses the impact of anti-Semitism on German society during Hitler's regime and expresses concern about the rise of anti-Semitism from the left in recent years. They argue that the greatest threat to Jewish annihilation in this generation comes from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. As a synagogue attendee and advocate for concealed carry, the author hopes that armed guards will not be necessary in American synagogues, as it would mark a loss of America's unique freedom from such fears.
