SUMMARY: The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, the greatest massacre of Jews in American history, marks a tragic turning point in the history of the United States. While America has long been a haven for Jews, this attack adds the country to the list of nations where Jews have been *murdered* solely for being Jewish. This unique form of *antisemitism*, driven by a desire for *extermination*, poses a threat not only to Jews but to the very fabric of society. The author draws a parallel between Hitler's *Jew-hatred* and the current rise of *antisemitism* from the left, particularly on college campuses. The threat of *annihilation* facing Jews today comes from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. The article concludes with a prayerful wish to preserve the uniqueness of America, where Jews have traditionally not needed armed guards in their synagogues, and a call to action for all Americans, Jews and non-Jews alike, to *fight antisemitism* and protect the nation's future.
END OF SUMMARY.
