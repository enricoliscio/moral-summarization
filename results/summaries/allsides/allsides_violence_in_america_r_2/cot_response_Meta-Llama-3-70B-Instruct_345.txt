SUMMARY:
The author, a Jew and an American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author notes that anti-Semitism destroys every society in which it grows, citing the example of Nazi Germany. He criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for spreading false claims of increased anti-Semitism in America, and instead argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left. The author fervently prays that armed guards will not be needed at American synagogues, and urges Americans to fight anti-Semitism, as the fate of the nation is tied to the fate of its Jews.
