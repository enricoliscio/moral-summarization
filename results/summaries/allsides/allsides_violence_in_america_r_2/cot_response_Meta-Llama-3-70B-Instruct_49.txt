SUMMARY:
As a Jew who has fought anti-Semitism, I believe that the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre is a unique American tragedy. It's painful because America has finally joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews. Anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. This hatred destroys every society it grows in, as seen in Nazi Germany. I'm skeptical of claims of increased anti-Semitism in America, as many organizations have a left-wing, anti-Trump agenda. In reality, the Pittsburgh murderer criticized Trump for his close connections to Jews and Israel. The biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left, threatening Jewish annihilation. As an advocate for concealed weapons, I pray we won't need armed guards at American synagogues. Fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for America's uniqueness and fate. END OF SUMMARY.
