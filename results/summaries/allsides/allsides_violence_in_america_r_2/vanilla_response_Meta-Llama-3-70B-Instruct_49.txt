SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, America has finally joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews. The author notes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill all Jews, and that it destroys every society in which it grows. The author questions the reliability of reports on increasing anti-Semitism in America, citing the example of false bomb threats to Jewish Community Centers. The author argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left and that Jewish leftists prioritize leftism over Judaism. The author concludes that fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the fate of America, and hopes that armed guards will not be needed in American synagogues.
