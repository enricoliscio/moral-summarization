SUMMARY:
The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre was a tragic and painful event in American history, marking the country's inclusion on the list of nations where Jews have been *murdered* for their identity. This article discusses the unique nature of anti-Semitism, which seeks not just to *persecute* or *enslave* Jews but to annihilate them entirely. The author reflects on the destructive nature of anti-Semitism, citing the example of Adolf Hitler whose animating force was Jew-hatred, ultimately leading to the devastation of Germany. While it is uncertain if anti-Semitism has increased in America, the author criticizes Jewish organizations and the media for their biased reporting and blames the left for the recent surge in anti-Semitic sentiments. The article emphasizes the threat of *annihilation* from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies and the author's fervent prayer that armed guards won't be necessary at synagogues, preserving America's *uniqueness*. The article concludes with a call to fight anti-Semitism for the love of America and the understanding that the fate of the nation is intertwined with the treatment of its Jewish citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
