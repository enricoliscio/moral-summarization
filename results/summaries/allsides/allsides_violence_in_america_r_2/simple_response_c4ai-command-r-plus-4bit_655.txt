SUMMARY: The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the deadliest attack on Jews in American history, marks a tragic turning point for the United States as it joins the list of countries where Jews have been murdered solely for their religious identity. While anti-Semitism exists worldwide, it is unique in its exterminationist nature, aiming not just to persecute or expel Jews but to annihilate them completely. This hatred has destructive consequences for any society that harbors it, as seen in Nazi Germany. Despite conflicting reports and political agendas, the threat of anti-Semitism persists, with the most significant increase coming from the left in recent years. As a Jew and an American, the author grieves this senseless loss of life and hopes that armed guards will not become a necessity at synagogues across the nation. The fight against anti-Semitism is not just a battle for the safety of Jews but for the preservation of the very fabric of American society.
