Alright, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The author is a Jewish American who's spent his life fighting anti-Semitism. He's saying that despite the Pittsburgh massacre, America is still the best place for Jews, but the tragedy is unique because it's the first time Jews were murdered here for being Jews. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is about extermination, not just persecution.

He mentions the Haggadah and how anti-Semitism is about annihilating Jews, which the Pittsburgh shooter exemplified. He also talks about how anti-Semitism destroys societies, citing Hitler and the consequences for Germany.

He's critical of Jewish organizations and media, especially on the left, for falsely claiming an increase in anti-Semitism after Trump's election, which turned out to be mostly a hoax. He argues that the left is a bigger source of anti-Semitism now, and that blaming Trump is wrong because the shooter actually criticized Trump for being pro-Israel.

He ends by saying that the fate of the nation is tied to how Jews are treated, urging everyone to fight anti-Semitism, not just for Jews but for America's sake.

I need to capture all these points concisely, using the moral terms like tragedy, massacre, anti-Semitism, murder, etc. I should make sure the summary reflects the author's strong moral stance against anti-Semitism and his critique of certain groups.

SUMMARY: The author, a Jewish American and anti-Semitism expert, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy as Jews were murdered for being Jews for the first time in U.S. history. Anti-Semitism, he argues, is exterminationist, aiming to annihilate Jews, as seen in the shooter's cry, "All Jews must die."

He critiques Jewish left-wing organizations for falsely claiming an increase in anti-Semitism after Trump's election, exposing a hoax involving bomb threats.

The author, who attends synagogue and advocates for concealed carry, prays for armed guards' irrelevance in synagogues. He emphasizes that fighting anti-Semitism is not just for Jews but for America's sake, as the nation's fate is tied to how Jews are treated. END OF SUMMARY.
