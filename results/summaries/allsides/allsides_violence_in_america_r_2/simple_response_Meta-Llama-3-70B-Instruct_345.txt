SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, the attack marks a painful turning point. The author emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, seeking to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. This hatred destroys societies, as seen in Nazi Germany, where anti-Semitism was the raison d'Ãªtre. The author questions the reliability of reports on rising anti-Semitism in America, citing biased left-wing agendas. Instead, they argue that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left, threatening Jewish students on college campuses. The author urges Americans to fight anti-Semitism, not just for the sake of Jews, but for the nation's own well-being, as the fate of Jews is tied to the fate of the country in which they live.
