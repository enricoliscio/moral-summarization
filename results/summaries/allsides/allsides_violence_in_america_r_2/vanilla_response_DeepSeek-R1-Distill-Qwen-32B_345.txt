Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The author is a Jewish person who has been fighting anti-Semitism for a long time. He mentions his background, like writing a book on anti-Semitism and working with the Soviet Union. He starts by saying that Jews in America are the luckiest, but then talks about the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre as the worst in US history. 

He explains that anti-Semitism is unique because it's about annihilating Jews, not just persecuting them. He quotes the Haggadah, emphasizing that in every generation, there are those who want to destroy Jews. He also connects anti-Semitism to historical events, like Hitler and the Holocaust, showing how it affects the entire society.

The author is critical of some Jewish organizations and media for their bias, especially against Trump. He points out that they exaggerated anti-Semitism, like the bomb threats being mostly from a troubled teen. He argues that blaming Trump for anti-Semitism is wrong, especially since Trump is pro-Israel. 

He also mentions that anti-Semitism has increased on the left, affecting young Jews on college campuses. The author believes that the real threat to Jews comes from Iran and Arab enemies, not just domestic issues. He hopes synagogues don't need armed guards and ties the fate of Jews to the nation's well-being.

So, the main points are: the Pittsburgh massacre as a unique tragedy, the nature of anti-Semitism as wanting to annihilate Jews, the societal impact, criticism of media and organizations, the increase on the left, and the external threats. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting these key points.
