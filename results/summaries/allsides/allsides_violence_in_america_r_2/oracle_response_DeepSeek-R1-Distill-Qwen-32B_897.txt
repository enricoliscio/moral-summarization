Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is a Jewish American who has fought against anti-Semitism, and he's reflecting on the Pittsburgh massacre. He emphasizes that this event is a unique tragedy because it's the first time such a massacre happened in America. He differentiates anti-Semitism from other forms of hatred by pointing out its exterminationist nature, referencing historical examples like the Holocaust. 

He also critiques the left for dishonest claims about increased anti-Semitism, citing a specific example of false bomb threats. He argues that the real threat comes from the left and from Israel's enemies. The author advocates for vigilance and the protection of synagogues, tying the fate of Jews to the nation's well-being.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the listed moral terms. I'll make sure to include words like "anti-Semitism," "massacre," "tragedy," "murdered," "painful," "exterminationist," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the uniqueness of the Pittsburgh event, the nature of anti-Semitism, the critique of the left, and the call to action to protect Jews and the nation.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without losing the moral emphasis. I'll also make sure to mention the author's advocacy for vigilance and the importance of fighting anti-Semitism for the sake of the nation.
