SUMMARY: All my life, I have reminded my fellow Jews in America that we are the luckiest to have ever lived in a non-Jewish nation. Even after the tragic massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, this remains true. However, the greatest massacre of Jews in American history is a unique tragedy. America has now joined the list of countries where Jews have been murdered for their religion, and this is painful for both Americans and Jews. Anti-Semitism is exterminationist; it seeks to annihilate Jews and destroys every society in which it grows. While there may be an increase in anti-Semitism in America, it is difficult to trust the sources due to political agendas and biases. The blame for the Pittsburgh massacre on Trump is a falsehood, as the murderer criticized Trump's close connections to Jews and Israel. The biggest increase in anti-Semitism in recent years has come from the left and from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. As a Jew who attends synagogue regularly, I pray that we will not need armed guards at our places of worship. America's uniqueness lies in the fact that Jews have not needed armed guards in synagogues, and this must be preserved. Fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the well-being of both Jews and America as a whole.
END OF SUMMARY.
