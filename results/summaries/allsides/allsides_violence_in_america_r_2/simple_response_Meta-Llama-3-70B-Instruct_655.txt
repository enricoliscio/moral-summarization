SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, acknowledging that despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, anti-Semitism has finally reached American shores. He emphasizes the unique aspect of anti-Semitism, which aims to exterminate Jews, not just persecute or expel them. The author also highlights how anti-Semitism destroys every society it grows in, citing the devastating consequences of German anti-Semitism during the Nazi era. He expresses skepticism towards claims of increased anti-Semitism in America, citing the false narrative of bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers. Instead, he believes the greatest threat to Jews comes from the left, particularly on college campuses, and from Israel's enemies. The author concludes by urging Americans to fight anti-Semitism, not just for the sake of Jews, but for the well-being of the nation as a whole.
