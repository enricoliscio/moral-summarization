Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is quite lengthy, so I'll start by reading through it carefully to understand the main points.

The author is a Jewish American who has spent his life fighting anti-Semitism. He starts by stating that Jews in America are the luckiest, but he reflects on the Pittsburgh massacre as a tragic event. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is unique because it's exterminationist, aiming to kill all Jews, unlike other forms of persecution. He references historical context, like the Holocaust, to show how anti-Semitism destroys societies.

He then discusses how some organizations and media have falsely claimed an increase in anti-Semitism, using the example of bomb threats that turned out to be from a single source. He criticizes the left for using the Pittsburgh tragedy to blame Trump, pointing out that the perpetrator actually criticized Trump for being close to Jews and Israel.

The author also mentions that anti-Semitism has increased on the left, affecting young Jews on college campuses. He hopes synagogues won't need armed guards and urges fighting anti-Semitism for the sake of America, linking the fate of Jews to the nation's well-being.

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally charged words as possible, like "antisemitism," "massacre," "tragedy," "murdered," "painful," etc. The summary should capture the author's perspective on the uniqueness of anti-Semitism, its impact on society, and the critique of media and organizations.

I should structure the summary to first mention the Pittsburgh massacre as a tragedy, explain the unique nature of anti-Semitism, critique the false claims about increased anti-Semitism, and conclude with the author's call to action. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll need to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include all key points and maintain the moral tone. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, I'll ensure that the morally framed words are preserved as per the user's request.
