SUMMARY: The author reflects on the tragic massacre of Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, the deadliest attack on Jews in American history. They attribute this horrifying act to the destructive force of anti-Semitism, which seeks nothing less than the annihilation of Jews. The author laments that even the most fortunate Jewish community in a non-Jewish country is not immune to such atrocities. They highlight the uniqueness of anti-Semitism, which has the power to destroy societies, and how it was the driving force behind Adolf Hitler's actions. While it is uncertain if anti-Semitism has increased in America, the author argues that the left-wing media and Jewish organizations have been dishonest in blaming the Pittsburgh massacre on Trump. Instead, they point out that the murderer criticized Trump's pro-Israel stance. The biggest threat to Jews today comes from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. The author fervently prays that American synagogues will remain unarmed, preserving the country's uniqueness in this regard. They emphasize that fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the well-being of both Jews and America as a whole. END OF SUMMARY.
