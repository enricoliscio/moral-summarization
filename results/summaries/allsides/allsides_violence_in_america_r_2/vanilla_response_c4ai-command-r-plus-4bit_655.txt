SUMMARY: In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the author reflects on the unique tragedy of anti-Semitism in America and its destructive nature. They argue that while any loss of life is tragic, the targeted murder of Jews for being Jewish is distinct due to the exterminationist nature of anti-Semitism. The author also highlights the destructive impact of anti-Semitism on societies throughout history, using Germany under Hitler as an example. They express concern about the increase in anti-Semitism from the left and the threat posed by Israel's enemies. As a Jew and an advocate for gun rights, the author hopes that armed guards will not be necessary at synagogues in America, a country where Jews have traditionally been safe. They emphasize the importance of fighting anti-Semitism for the sake of both Jews and the nation as a whole.
