SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy and a painful reminder that anti-Semitism has finally reached the United States. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, seeking to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author notes that this hatred destroys every society in which it grows, citing Nazi Germany as an example. He criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for crying "fire" in a crowded theater, falsely blaming Trump for an increase in anti-Semitism. In reality, the Pittsburgh murderer criticized Trump for his close connections to Jews and Israel. The author argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left, and that Jews must fight against anti-Semites to protect America's uniqueness. He prays that armed guards will not be needed at American synagogues, and that America will always be a safe haven for Jews.
