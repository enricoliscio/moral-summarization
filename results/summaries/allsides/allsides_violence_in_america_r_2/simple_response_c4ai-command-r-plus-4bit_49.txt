SUMMARY: Jews in America have been the luckiest to have ever lived in a non-Jewish country. However, the recent massacre of Jews in Pittsburgh is a unique American tragedy, as it marks the first time in history that Jews have been murdered for being Jewish on American soil. While there is no difference in the loss of life between the murder of Christians and Jews, anti-Semitism is distinct in its exterminationist nature, aiming to annihilate all Jews. This hatred has destroyed societies in the past, and its growth in America, particularly on college campuses and from the political left, is concerning. The author, as someone who attends synagogue regularly and advocates for concealed carry, hopes that armed guards will not be necessary at American synagogues, as they have been a place of refuge for Jews in the past. Fighting anti-Semitism is crucial not just for Jews but for the nation as a whole, as the fate of the Jews is intertwined with the fate of America. END OF SUMMARY.
