Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully first. The author is a Jewish American who's spent a lot of time fighting anti-Semitism. He mentions writing a book, teaching Jewish history, and even smuggling in the Soviet Union. He's reflecting on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. 

He points out that while anti-Semitism exists elsewhere, the scale in America is new because of its population size. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism isn't just persecution but aims to annihilate Jews, referencing the Haggadah. He also talks about how anti-Semitism affects societies, citing Hitler's Germany as an example.

The author is critical of some Jewish organizations, especially those on the left, for their anti-Trump stance and claims about increased anti-Semitism. He provides an example where most bomb threats were false, leading to distrust in these organizations. He argues that blaming Trump for the Pittsburgh attack is incorrect since the attacker criticized Trump's ties to Jews and Israel.

He also mentions that anti-Semitism has increased on the left, affecting young Jews on college campuses. The author hopes synagogues don't need armed guards and believes fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for America's well-being. 

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: the uniqueness of the Pittsburgh attack, the nature of anti-Semitism, the author's critique of left-wing organizations, and the importance of addressing anti-Semitism for the nation's sake.
