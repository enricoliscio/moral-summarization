Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author is a Jewish scholar who's been fighting anti-Semitism. He's emphasizing that America is unique because Jews have been safe there, but the Pittsburgh massacre changed that. He points out that anti-Semitism is about extermination, not just persecution. He also criticizes the left for dishonestly blaming Trump, when the real threats come from the left and from Iran/Arab enemies. He wants people to protect America's values by fighting anti-Semitism.

I should make sure the summary includes these points: the uniqueness of America's safety for Jews, the Pittsburgh tragedy, the nature of anti-Semitism as exterminationist, the critique of left-wing dishonesty, and the call to protect American values.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all these elements. Let me structure it step by step.

SUMMARY: The author, a Jewish scholar and anti-Semitism advocate, reflects on the unique safety Jews have historically enjoyed in America. He highlights the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre as a tragic shift, marking America's inclusion in the list of countries where Jews are killed for their identity. Anti-Semitism, he argues, is distinct because it seeks annihilation, not just persecution, as seen in the shooter's call for Jewish extermination. The author criticizes left-wing groups for dishonestly blaming President Trump for anti-Semitism, citing fabricated bomb threat claims. He asserts that anti-Semitism has grown among the left, particularly on college campuses, and warns that the real threats to Jews come from Iran and Arab adversaries. Emphasizing America's historical exceptionality in protecting Jews without armed guards, he urges all Americans to combat anti-Semitism, as the fate of the nation is tied to the well-being of its Jewish community. END OF SUMMARY.
