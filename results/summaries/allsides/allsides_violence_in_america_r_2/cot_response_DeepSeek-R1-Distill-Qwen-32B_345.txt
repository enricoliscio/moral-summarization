Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the key points and the moral words used.

The author starts by stating that American Jews are the luckiest, but the Pittsburgh massacre changed that perception. He mentions anti-Semitism as unique because it's about annihilation, not just persecution. He references the Haggadah to emphasize this point. 

He then discusses how anti-Semitism affects societies, using Hitler as an example. He's critical of Jewish organizations and the media for falsely claiming an increase in anti-Semitism, pointing out that most threats were from a single individual. He argues that blaming Trump is dishonest and that anti-Semitism is actually increasing from the left, affecting college campuses. 

The author also expresses hope that synagogues won't need armed guards and urges fighting anti-Semitism for the sake of America.

Now, I'll list the morally framed words: lucky, tragedy, inevitable, painful, unique, anti-Semitism, exterminationist, annihilation, Holocaust, dishonest, blame, pro-Israel, leftism, threat, annihilation, armed guards, fight, fate.

For the summary, I'll need to include these words where appropriate, keeping it concise. I'll structure it to highlight the Pittsburgh massacre, the nature of anti-Semitism, the critique of organizations, the rise from the left, and the call to action.
