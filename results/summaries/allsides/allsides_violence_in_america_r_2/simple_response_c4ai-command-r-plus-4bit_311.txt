SUMMARY: In the wake of the tragic shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Dennis Prager, a Jew who attends synagogue every Shabbat and is an advocate for carrying concealed weapons, reflects on the unique tragedy of anti-Semitism in America. Prager highlights the disturbing truth that anti-Semitism seeks not just to persecute or expel Jews, but to annihilate them entirely. He draws a parallel between this mindset and the goals of Adolf Hitler, whose anti-Semitic ideology led to the deaths of millions, including Germans. Prager questions the accuracy of claims made by left-wing Jewish organizations and media regarding increased anti-Semitism under President Trump. He argues that the Pittsburgh shooter criticized Trump for his close ties with Jews and Israel, refuting the notion that Trump is to blame. Prager also points to the left, including college campuses, as the source of a significant increase in anti-Semitism in recent years. He emphasizes the importance of fighting anti-Semitism, not just for the sake of Jews, but for the well-being of America as a whole. Prager fervently hopes that armed guards will not be necessary at American synagogues, preserving the uniqueness of America where Jews have traditionally not needed such protection.
