Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article. The user wants me to focus on preserving the moral framing that the author used. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's written by a Jewish author who has a lot of experience with anti-Semitism, both in the US and elsewhere. He's making some strong points about the uniqueness of anti-Semitism and its impact on American society.

The user has two main tasks: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should end with specific tokens.

Starting with the first step, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral weight. Words like "luckiest," "anti-Semitism," "massacre," "tragedy," "painful," "unique," "exterminationist," "scapegoat," "dishonest," "falsehood," "pro-Israel," "ethnically Jewish," "values," "increase," "enemies," "pray," "armed guards," "uniqueness," "advocacy," "fervently," "fate," "fight," "values," "ethics," "truth," "integrity," "loyalty," "hatred," "scapegoat," "destruction," "dehumanization," "hatred," "persecution," "expulsion," "destruction," "values," "ethics," "truth," "integrity," "loyalty," "hatred," "scapegoat," "destruction," "dehumanization," "hatred," "persecution," "expulsion," "destruction," "values," "ethics," "truth," "integrity," "loyalty," "hatred," "scapegoat," "destruction," "dehumanization," "hatred," "persecution," "expulsion," "destruction," "values," "ethics," "truth," "integrity," "loyalty," "hatred," "scapegoat," "destruction," "dehumanization," "hatred," "persecution," "expulsion," "destruction," "values," "ethics," "truth," "integrity," "loyalty," "hatred," "scapegoat," "destruction," "dehumanization," "hatred," "persecution," "expulsion," "destruction."

Wait, that seems repetitive. Maybe I should look for unique words that carry moral connotations. Let me go through the article again.

The author talks about being the "luckiest" Jews, "anti-Semitism," "massacre," "tragedy," "painful," "unique," "exterminationist," "scapegoat," "dishonest," "falsehood," "pro-Israel," "ethnically Jewish," "values," "increase," "enemies," "pray," "armed guards," "uniqueness," "advocacy," "fervently," "fate," "fight," "values," "ethics," "truth," "integrity," "loyalty," "hatred," "scapegoat," "destruction," "dehumanization," "hatred," "persecution," "expulsion," "destruction."

I think I got all the key morally framed words. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these as possible without making it too long. The summary should capture the author's main points: the uniqueness of anti-Semitism in America, the impact on society, the false claims by left-wing organizations, the Pittsburgh massacre, and the call to fight anti-Semitism to protect American values.

I should structure the summary to first state the author's main argument about the uniqueness of anti-Semitism, then mention the Pittsburgh tragedy, the false claims by organizations, and conclude with the call to action. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words like "anti-Semitism," "massacre," "tragedy," "exterminationist," "dishonest," "falsehood," "pro-Israel," "pray," "armed guards," "uniqueness," "fight," "values."

Let me draft that. Starting with the author's perspective on being the luckiest Jews, then the Pittsburgh massacre as a unique tragedy. Mention anti-Semitism's exterminationist nature, the dishonest claims by organizations, and the need to fight anti-Semitism to protect American values and synagogues. End with the prayer for not needing armed guards.

I think that covers the main points and includes the necessary morally framed words. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, keeping it under 200 words.
