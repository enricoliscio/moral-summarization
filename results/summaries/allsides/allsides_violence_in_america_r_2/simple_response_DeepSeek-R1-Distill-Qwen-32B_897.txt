Alright, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The author is a Jewish American who has written about anti-Semitism and has a background in fighting it. He starts by stating that Jews in America are the luckiest, but the Pittsburgh massacre changed things because it's the first time Jews were killed in America just for being Jews. He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is unique because it's about annihilation, not just persecution. He references the Haggadah to support this point.

He then discusses how anti-Semitism affected Germany, leading to massive destruction and loss, not just for Jews but for Germans themselves. He questions whether anti-Semitism has increased in America, citing the example of bomb threats at Jewish Community Centers, which turned out to be mostly false. He accuses left-wing organizations of dishonestly blaming Trump for the increase, even though the Pittsburgh shooter criticized Trump for being pro-Israel.

The author also mentions that anti-Semitism has grown on the left, affecting young Jews on college campuses. He hopes synagogues won't need armed guards and urges people to fight anti-Semitism for the sake of America's well-being.

Now, I need to capture all these points concisely, making sure to highlight the moral aspects: the uniqueness of anti-Semitism, its destructive impact, the critique of left-wing organizations, and the call to action for Americans to combat anti-Semitism.

I should structure the summary to first state the main thesis about Jews in America being lucky but affected by the Pittsburgh massacre. Then explain the uniqueness of anti-Semitism, its historical impact, the critique of media and organizations, and the call to protect synagogues and the nation.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key points without getting bogged down in details. Also, ensure the moral framing is clear, like the destructive nature of anti-Semitism and the responsibility to combat it.
