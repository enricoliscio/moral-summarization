Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully.

The author is a Jewish American who's written about anti-Semitism and has a background in fighting it. He starts by saying that American Jews are the luckiest, but the Pittsburgh massacre changed things. He points out that anti-Semitism is unique because it's about annihilating Jews, not just persecution.

He mentions how anti-Semitism affected Germany, leading to massive losses. He's skeptical about claims of increased anti-Semitism in the U.S., citing the false bomb threat claims. He argues that left-wing groups are often the source of anti-Semitism now, especially on college campuses.

The author also talks about the Pittsburgh shooter blaming Trump, but he counters that the shooter criticized Trump for being pro-Israel. He believes that Jewish leftists get their values from leftism, not Judaism, unlike Jewish liberals.

He ends by emphasizing the importance of fighting anti-Semitism for the sake of America, not just Jews.

I should condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: the uniqueness of anti-Semitism, its impact on societies, the author's skepticism about recent trends, the left's role, and the call to action for America.

SUMMARY: The author, a Jewish American with a background in fighting anti-Semitism, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, emphasizing that anti-Semitism uniquely targets Jews for annihilation.

Anti-Semitism, he argues, is not just persecution but a desire for extermination, as seen in the shooter's call for Jews' deaths. He also highlights how anti-Semitism devastated Germany, causing immense suffering. The author critiques claims of rising anti-Semitism in the U.S., citing false bomb threat allegations tied to a teenager and a radical.

The author urges Americans to combat anti-Semitism to protect both Jewish communities and the nation's values. END OF SUMMARY.
