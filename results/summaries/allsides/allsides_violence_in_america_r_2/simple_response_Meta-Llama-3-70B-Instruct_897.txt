SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish historian and advocate, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews in a non-Jewish country, America has finally joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews. The author highlights the uniqueness of anti-Semitism, which aims to exterminate Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. He notes that anti-Semitism destroys every society it grows in, citing Nazi Germany as an example. The author criticizes Jewish organizations and left-wing media for exaggerating the rise of anti-Semitism in America, citing the false narrative of increased bomb threats after Trump's election. He argues that the real threat of anti-Semitism comes from the left and Israel's enemies, and urges Americans to fight anti-Semitism to protect the nation's values. The author concludes by praying that armed guards will not be needed in American synagogues, emphasizing that the fate of Jews is tied to the fate of the nation.
