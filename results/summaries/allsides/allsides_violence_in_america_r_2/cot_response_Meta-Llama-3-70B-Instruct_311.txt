SUMMARY:
The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre is a unique American tragedy, marking the first time Jews were murdered for being Jews in the United States. This tragedy is painful for both Americans and Jews, as it highlights the exterminationist nature of anti-Semitism, which seeks to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author argues that anti-Semitism destroys every society in which it grows, citing the devastating consequences of Nazi anti-Semitism in Germany. While the author questions the reported increase in anti-Semitism in America, he notes that the greatest threat to Jews comes from the left, particularly on college campuses. He fervently prays that armed guards will not be needed in American synagogues, emphasizing that fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the fate of the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
