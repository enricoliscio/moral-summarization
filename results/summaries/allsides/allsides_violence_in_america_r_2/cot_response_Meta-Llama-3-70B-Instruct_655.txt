SUMMARY:
The author, a Jew, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. He notes that while America has finally joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews, it's painful for both Americans and Jews. The author emphasizes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill all Jews, as seen in the murderer's cry, "All Jews must die.‚Äù He warns that anti-Semitism destroys every society it grows in, citing the Nazi regime as an example. The author criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for dishonestly blaming Trump for increasing anti-Semitism, when in reality, the Pittsburgh murderer criticized Trump for his close connections to Jews and Israel. The author concludes that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left and that fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for America's fate. END OF SUMMARY.
