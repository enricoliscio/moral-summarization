SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, America has finally joined the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jews. The author notes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill all Jews, and that it destroys every society in which it grows. The author criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations and media for exaggerating the rise of anti-Semitism in America, citing the false narrative of increased bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers. In reality, the Pittsburgh murderer criticized Trump for his close connections to Jews and Israel. The author argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left and that Jews need to fight anti-Semitism to protect America's values. The author hopes that armed guards will not be needed in American synagogues, as has been the case in the past.
