SUMMARY:

The author, a Jew and an American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, the attack marks a painful turning point. The author notes that anti-Semitism is exterminationist, aiming to kill Jews, not just persecute or expel them. He also highlights how anti-Semitism destroys societies, citing Nazi Germany as an example. The author questions the reported increase in anti-Semitism in America, suggesting that some Jewish organizations and media outlets have a left-wing, anti-Trump agenda. He argues that the biggest increase in anti-Semitism comes from the left and that Jews should be concerned about threats from Israel's enemies. The author hopes that armed guards will not be needed in American synagogues and urges Americans to fight anti-Semitism, as the fate of the nation is tied to the well-being of its Jewish community.
