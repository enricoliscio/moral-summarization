SUMMARY: The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, the greatest massacre of Jews in American history, is a unique tragedy. America has now joined the list of countries where Jews have been murdered for being Jewish. While this may have been inevitable given the country's population, it is still painful. Anti-Semitism is exterminationist; anti-Semites want to kill all Jews. This hatred destroys every society in which it grows, as seen in Nazi Germany. The author questions the increase in anti-Semitism in America, distrusting the agendas of Jewish organizations and media outlets. The blame on Trump for increasing anti-Semitism is a falsehood, as the Pittsburgh murderer criticized his close connections to Jews and Israel. The biggest increase in anti-Semitism has come from the left, threatening Jewish annihilation. The author, as a Jew and an advocate for concealed weapons, prays that armed guards won't be needed at synagogues, a unique aspect of America. Fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the nation's fate.
