SUMMARY: The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, the greatest massacre of Jews in American history, is a unique tragedy. America has finally joined the list of countries where Jews have been murdered for being Jewish. While this was inevitable given the population size, it is still painful. Anti-Semitism is exterminationist; anti-Semites want to kill all Jews. This hatred destroys societies, as seen in Nazi Germany, where it led to millions of deaths and the division of Germany. There is a debate about the increase in anti-Semitism in America, with some Jewish organizations accused of having a left-wing, anti-Trump agenda. The Pittsburgh murderer criticized Trump's connections with Jews and Israel. The biggest increase in anti-Semitism has come from the left, and the current threat of annihilation comes from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. The author fervently prays that armed guards won't be needed at American synagogues, as it would destroy America's uniqueness as a place where Jews have not needed protection. Fighting anti-Semitism is crucial for the nation's fate.
