Okay, so I need to summarize this article while keeping the moral framing intact. The author is talking about anti-Semitism in America, using strong words like massacre, tragedy, and murder. I should make sure those words are included in the summary. 

The article starts by the author emphasizing that Jews in America are the luckiest, but then shifts to the Pittsburgh massacre as a unique tragedy. I should note that this event made America part of the list of countries where Jews were murdered for being Jewish. 

The author contrasts the uniqueness of anti-Semitism with other forms of hatred, pointing out that anti-Semitism aims for annihilation, not just persecution or expulsion. This is important for the moral framing, so I need to highlight that.

He also talks about how anti-Semitism destroys societies, referencing Hitler and the Holocaust. That's a strong point about the consequences of anti-Semitism, so I should include that.

There's a part where the author questions whether anti-Semitism has increased in America, citing the bomb threat incidents that were later found to be from a troubled teen and a radical. This shows a point about false claims and the media's role, which is a moral issue about misinformation.

The author criticizes Jewish organizations for having a left-wing agenda and not being trustworthy, which ties into the moral framing of dishonesty and blame. He also mentions that anti-Semitism is increasing on the left, affecting college campuses, which is another moral point about the environment for Jewish students.

Finally, the author prays that synagogues won't need armed guards and urges people to fight anti-Semitism for the sake of America's integrity. This is a hopeful note but still within the moral context.

I need to condense all these points into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it too long. I'll structure it to first state the author's main points about the Pittsburgh massacre and the nature of anti-Semitism, then touch on the societal impact, false claims, and the current state of anti-Semitism in America, ending with the call to action.

This event highlights the exterminationist nature of anti-Semitism, where Jews are targeted not just for persecution or expulsion, but for annihilation.

The author also critiques the dishonesty in claims of increased anti-Semitism in America, citing false bomb threat incidents and the lack of accountability from Jewish organizations. They argue that anti-Semitism has grown on the left, particularly on college campuses, and that blaming President Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre is a falsehood.

Fighting anti-Semitism is not just for Jews but for the nation's integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
