Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is a Jewish American who's been fighting anti-Semitism, including working in the Soviet Union. He mentions the Pittsburgh massacre as a significant event, highlighting that it's unique because it's the first time Jews were murdered in America for being Jews. He contrasts this with other hate crimes, emphasizing that anti-Semitism aims to annihilate Jews, not just persecute or expel them. 

He also talks about the broader impact of anti-Semitism, referencing Hitler and the Holocaust, showing how it destroys societies. He criticizes some Jewish organizations and media for dishonestly claiming an increase in anti-Semitism, pointing out that many threats were false. He argues that the blame for the Pittsburgh attack shouldn't fall on Trump, especially since Trump is pro-Israel. 

The author distinguishes between Jewish liberals and leftists, suggesting the latter get their values from leftism, not Judaism. He notes that anti-Semitism has increased on the left and that the real threat to Jews comes from Iran and Arab enemies. He prays that synagogues won't need armed guards and urges people to fight anti-Semitism for the sake of America's values.

Now, I'll identify the key points to include in the summary, making sure to use the morally framed words. I need to mention the Pittsburgh massacre, the uniqueness of anti-Semitism as exterminationist, the societal destruction, the false claims by organizations, the blame on Trump being a falsehood, the difference between Jewish liberals and leftists, the increase in anti-Semitism from the left, the threat from Iran and Arab enemies, the prayer for synagogues, and the call to fight anti-Semitism for the nation's sake.

I'll structure the summary to start with the author's perspective, mention the Pittsburgh event, explain anti-Semitism's nature, discuss the societal impact, critique the false claims, address the blame on Trump, differentiate between liberals and leftists, note the increase in anti-Semitism, mention the external threats, and conclude with the call to action.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. I'll also check that I'm using the morally framed words provided, like massacre, tragedy, murdered, anti-Semitism, exterminationist, destroy, blame, etc.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence encapsulates a key point without being too wordy. I'll start with the author's statement about being the luckiest Jews, then move to the Pittsburgh massacre, the nature of anti-Semitism, societal destruction, false claims, critique of organizations, blame on Trump, the distinction between liberals and leftists, the increase in anti-Semitism, threats from Iran and Arab enemies, the prayer for synagogues, and the call to fight anti-Semitism.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it as a natural summary. I'll also ensure that the summary doesn't add any new information beyond what's in the article and stays focused on the moral framing.
