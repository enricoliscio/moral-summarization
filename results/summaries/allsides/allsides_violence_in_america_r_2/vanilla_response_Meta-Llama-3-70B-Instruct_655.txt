SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, calling it a unique American tragedy. Despite being the luckiest Jews to live in a non-Jewish country, the attack marks a painful milestone. The author notes that anti-Semitism is distinct from other forms of persecution, as it seeks to annihilate Jews entirely. He cites the Haggadah, which says "In every generation, they arise to annihilate us." The author also argues that anti-Semitism destroys the societies in which it grows, citing the devastating consequences of Nazi anti-Semitism in Germany. He questions the reliability of reports on increasing anti-Semitism in America, citing biased sources and past false alarms. Instead, he believes the greatest threat to Jews comes from the left and from Israel's enemies. The author concludes by urging Americans to fight anti-Semitism, not just for the sake of Jews, but for the well-being of the nation itself.
