SUMMARY:

The author, a Jewish American, reflects on the massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, calling it a "unique American tragedy." He emphasizes that anti-Semitism is "exterminationist," aiming to "annihilate" Jews, not just persecute or enslave them. The author notes that anti-Semitism "destroys every society in which it grows," citing the devastating consequences of Nazi Germany's Jew-hatred. He criticizes Jewish organizations and media for having a "left-wing, anti-Trump agenda" and spreading false claims of increased anti-Semitism. The author argues that the real threat of anti-Semitism comes from the left and from Israel's enemies, not from President Trump. He prays that armed guards will not be needed at American synagogues, emphasizing that the fate of the nation is tied to the fate of its Jewish population. The author urges Americans to "fight anti-Semites" to protect the nation.
