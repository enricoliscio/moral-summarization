SUMMARY: The Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, the deadliest attack on Jews in American history, represents a unique tragedy. The author, a lifelong fighter against anti-Semitism, argues that anti-Semitism is exterminationist in nature, seeking to kill all Jews. This hatred has destroyed societies, as exemplified by Hitler's Germany. While the author is unsure if anti-Semitism has increased in America, he criticizes left-wing Jewish organizations for blaming Trump for rising anti-Semitism. He asserts that Trump is the most pro-Israel president since Truman and that the real threat of Jewish annihilation comes from Iran and Arab enemies. As an advocate for concealed weapons, the author prays that American synagogues will not require armed guards, preserving the country's uniqueness in keeping Jews safe. The piece concludes by emphasizing the need to fight anti-Semitism to protect both Jews and the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
