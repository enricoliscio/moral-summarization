SUMMARY: The massacre of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue is a tragedy and a unique American tragedy. It marks the first time in history that Jews have been murdered for being Jewish in the United States. While there is no difference in the loss of life between the murder of Christians and Jews, there is something unique about the murder of Jews due to the exterminationist nature of anti-Semitism. The author argues that anti-Semitism destroys every society in which it grows, using the example of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany to illustrate this point. There is a debate about whether there has been an increase in anti-Semitism in America, with some Jewish organizations and media outlets accused of having a left-wing, anti-Trump agenda. The author points out that previous claims of increased anti-Semitism under the Trump administration, such as bomb threats to Jewish Community Centers, were later found to be false. Similarly, blaming Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre is also considered a falsehood, as the murderer criticized Trump's close connections to Jews and Israel. The biggest increase in anti-Semitism in recent years has come from the left, and the threat of Jewish annihilation comes from Israel's Iranian and Arab enemies. The author prays that armed guards will not be needed at American synagogues, as it would mark a loss of America's uniqueness as a country where Jews have not needed such protection. Fighting anti-Semitism is not just about loving Jews, but also about loving America, as the fate of the nation is tied to the treatment of its Jewish population.
