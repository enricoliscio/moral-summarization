SUMMARY:
Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee sought to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, describing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They argued that Trump has put himself before his country, violating his most basic "responsibilities" to the people and breaking his "oath". Republicans fired back, accusing Democrats of being "desperate" to impeach Trump and labeling the inquiry a "hoax" and "fanciful" effort. The hearing was marked by objections and parliamentary maneuvers, with one man shouting that Democrats were committing "treason" before being led away by police. The committee is focused on two articles charging Trump with "abuse of power" and "obstruction of Congress". Democrats believe Trump's actions are a "danger" to the electoral process, while Republicans argue that the inquiry has uncovered no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. END OF SUMMARY.
