SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, citing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee hearing highlighted extensive evidence of Trump's wrongdoing, with Democrats accusing him of abusing his power and obstructing Congress' investigation. Republicans, however, fired back, calling the inquiry a "hoax" and claiming there's no evidence of wrongdoing. The hearing is a key step towards determining impeachment charges, which the full Democratic-controlled House is likely to vote on before Christmas. The heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, but Democrats argue that leaving him in office would undermine the US electoral process and national security.
