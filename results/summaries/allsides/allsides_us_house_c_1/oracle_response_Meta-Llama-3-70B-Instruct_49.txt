SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, citing his "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They accuse Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, violating his oath, and putting himself before his country. Republicans, on the other hand, claim the inquiry is based on "presumption" rather than "truth" and that Democrats are "desperate" to impeach Trump.

The heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the probe a "hoax". Democrats argue that leaving Trump in office would open the door to further undermining of the US electoral process, while Republicans claim the inquiry has uncovered no direct evidence of impeachable offenses.

The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on formal charges by the end of the week, setting up a clash with the White House and its Republican allies. END OF SUMMARY.
