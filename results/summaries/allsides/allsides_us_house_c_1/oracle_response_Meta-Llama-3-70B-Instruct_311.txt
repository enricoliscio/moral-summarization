SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, citing his "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They accuse him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, violating his oath, and putting himself before his country. Republicans fired back, claiming the inquiry is based on "presumption" rather than "truth" and that Democrats are "desperate" to impeach Trump. The hearing was marked by disruptions, objections, and points of order. The impeachment battle centers on whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the probe a "hoax." Democrats intend to decide which articles to bring forward, with the possibility of a vote on impeachment charges before Christmas. If impeached, Trump would face a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be needed to remove him from office.
