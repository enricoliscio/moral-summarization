SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats moved forward with impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, arguing that his actions towards Ukraine posed a threat to free and fair elections and national security. Representative Jerrold Nadler stated that Trump had violated his oath of office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival. Republicans countered that the impeachment inquiry lacked evidence and was politically motivated. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote this week on formal charges, with a full House vote likely before Christmas. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing by Trump. The hearing focused on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, with Democrats arguing that Trump withheld aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine. Republicans dismissed the case as baseless and accused Democrats of seeking to impeach Trump due to policy disagreements. Democrats countered that Trump's actions endangered the electoral process and national security. The Justice Department's watchdog found no evidence of political bias in the FBI's probe of Trump's campaign contacts with Russia. Democrats will decide on the final articles to bring forward after the hearing, with a Senate trial likely if Trump is impeached. 

END OF SUMMARY.
