Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave, so I have to make sure I capture the essence of both sides' arguments and the underlying moral issues.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about Democrats pushing for impeachment, accusing Trump of abusing power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and obstructing Congress. They see this as a danger to democracy. Republicans are opposing, saying it's a partisan move without solid evidence.

I should note that the article mentions the withholding of military aid and the White House meeting as leverage. Also, the comparison to the Mueller report and the Democrats' argument that Trump's actions threaten free elections.

On the Republican side, they argue there's no direct evidence and that Democrats are desperate. They also mention the lack of support among their own party members.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll structure it by starting with the Democrats' case, then the Republicans' response, and the context of the proceedings.

I should make sure to include key points like the articles of impeachment, the potential Senate trial, and the moral implications each side presents. Also, mention that no Republicans support impeachment and the White House's refusal to participate.

I think I should start with the Democrats' accusation, then the Republicans' counterarguments, and wrap up with the procedural steps and the moral framing from both sides.

Let me draft a few sentences to cover each part without going over the word limit. Make sure to include the moral aspects, like the danger to democracy and the accusations of partisanship.

Alright, I'll put it all together, ensuring it's clear and concise, preserving the moral perspectives presented in the article.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are advancing the case for impeaching President Trump, accusing him of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, which they argue endangers free elections and national security. Democrats argue Trump violated his oath by prioritizing his interests over the country, while Republicans counter that the impeachment inquiry is politically motivated and lacks evidence. The hearing was marked by disruptions, including a man shouting "treason," and Republicans criticized the process as unfair. The focus is on whether Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to coerce an investigation into Biden. Democrats warn that Trump's actions threaten democracy, while Republicans argue the case is weak and based on selective evidence. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on impeachment charges soon, with a Senate trial likely if Trump is impeached. The moral framing centers on whether Trump's actions constitute an abuse of power or a partisan witch hunt. END OF SUMMARY.
