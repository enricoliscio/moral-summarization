SUMMARY:
U.S. Democrats sought to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, describing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The top Democrat on the panel said there was extensive proof of Trump's "wrongdoing", accusing him of putting himself before his country and breaking his oath. Republicans fired back, calling the inquiry a "hoax" and the process "unfair". The hearing was disrupted by a man who shouted that Democrats were committing "treason". The heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Democrats believe Trump's actions are a "clear and present danger" to the U.S. electoral process and national security, while Republicans argue that the inquiry has uncovered no direct evidence of impeachable offenses.
