SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, accusing him of posing a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They claim Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Republicans argue that the impeachment inquiry is unfair and lacks evidence of wrongdoing. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on formal charges against Trump, which would lead to a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats believe Trump's actions undermine the electoral process and national security, while Republicans see the inquiry as a desperate attempt to unseat the president. The moral framing of the issue is clear: Democrats see Trump's actions as a violation of his oath and a threat to democracy, while Republicans view the inquiry as a partisan attack on the president.
