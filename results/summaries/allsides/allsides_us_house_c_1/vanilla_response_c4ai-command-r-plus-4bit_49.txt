SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats on Monday made their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing that his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee hearing, which was disrupted by Republican objections and a protester, focused on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats accused Trump of withholding aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to pressure it to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival. Republicans countered that Democrats were undermining democracy and had no evidence of impeachable offenses. The committee is expected to vote on the articles of impeachment by the end of the week, setting up a likely House vote before Christmas. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, calling the process unfair. Meanwhile, the Justice Department's watchdog found no evidence of political bias in the FBI's probe into Trump's campaign contacts with Russia. Democrats intend to decide on the final articles of impeachment after Monday's hearing, which also featured dueling reports from Intelligence Committee Democrats and Republicans.
END OF SUMMARY.
