Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Democrats pushing for impeachment, citing Trump's pressure on Ukraine as a danger to elections and national security. They've presented evidence, and Republicans are opposing, calling it a political maneuver. The hearing was disruptive, with objections and even a man shouting about treason. The main issue is whether Trump abused power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden and obstructed Congress. The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to vote on articles of impeachment, which would then go to the Senate. The White House isn't participating, claiming the process is unfair. The Democrats argue that Trump's actions threaten free elections, while Republicans say there's no direct evidence of wrongdoing.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral elements. I'll focus on the Democrats' arguments about the clear and present danger, the Republicans' dismissal as a political ploy, and the procedural steps. I should mention the key points: the hearing, evidence presented, Republican objections, the nature of the charges, and the political divide. Also, note that the White House isn't participating and the potential for a Senate trial.

I should structure it to show both sides' moral arguments. Democrats see it as a threat to democracy, while Republicans view it as a partisan attack. I'll make sure to include the main accusations and the lack of Republican support for impeachment.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all these elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with the Democrats' case, mention the hearing's disruptions, outline the charges, and then touch on the Republican counterarguments and the procedural next steps.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats have intensified their push for impeaching President Donald Trump, framing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden as a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security. In a contentious hearing, Democrats argued Trump had prioritized his interests over the country, violating his oath of office. Republicans countered, dismissing the case as a desperate political maneuver, with Representative Doug Collins accusing Democrats of abandoning truth for presumption. The hearing, part of the process to draft articles of impeachment, was disrupted by a protester shouting "treason." Trump denies wrongdoing, and the White House has boycotted the proceedings, claiming unfairness. The key issue centers on whether Trump abused power by withholding aid to Ukraine to coerce an investigation into Biden and obstructing Congress. Democrats argue this undermines U.S. electoral integrity, while Republicans maintain there’s no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on impeachment charges this week, setting the stage for a potential Senate trial, though conviction is unlikely. The divide over Trump’s actions reflects broader political polarization. END OF SUMMARY.
