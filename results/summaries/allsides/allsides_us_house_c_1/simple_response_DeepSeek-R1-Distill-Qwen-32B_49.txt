Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the U.S. Democrats pushing for Trump's impeachment, focusing on his actions regarding Ukraine. I should highlight the key points: the Democrats' arguments, the Republicans' counterarguments, the process in the House, and the implications. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main issues without getting too detailed. I should ensure that the moral aspects, like the danger to elections and national security, are included as per the author's framing. I'll also mention the opposing views, the potential Senate trial, and the context of previous impeachments. Let me structure this clearly, making sure each important point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are intensifying their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden constitutes a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security. At a raucous House Judiciary Committee hearing, Democrats presented extensive evidence, accusing Trump of prioritizing personal interests over the country and violating his oath of office. Republicans countered, dismissing the claims as desperate attempts to impeach a president they allege has done nothing wrong. The hearing, a key step toward drafting formal impeachment charges, was briefly disrupted by a protester. Trump denies wrongdoing, and the White House has boycotted the process, calling it unfair. The core issue is whether Trump abused his power by withholding military aid from Ukraine to coerce an investigation into Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. Democrats argue this undermines U.S. electoral integrity, while Republicans claim there's no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. The committee is expected to vote on charges by week's end, setting up a potential clash with the Senate, where conviction is unlikely. The proceedings highlight deep divisions in the U.S. over the morality and legality of Trump's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
