SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing to impeach President Donald Trump, accusing him of posing a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival. They claim Trump has "put himself before his country" and "broken his oath" by violating his basic responsibilities to the people. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that the impeachment inquiry is based on "presumption" rather than "truth" and that Democrats are "desperate" to remove Trump from office. The heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Democrats believe Trump's actions are a "clear and present danger" to the electoral process, while Republicans see it as a politically motivated effort to "coerce" Trump out of office. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on formal charges by the end of the week.
