Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key moral arguments from both sides.

First, the article mentions Democrats arguing that Trump's actions are a "clear and present danger" to elections and national security. They believe he put himself before the country and broke his oath. That's a strong moral statement against Trump's actions.

On the Republican side, they're countering by saying the process is unfair and that Democrats are desperate. They're framing it as a political move rather than a legitimate impeachment. They also mention that no Republican in the House supports impeachment, which shows party lines.

I should include the main points: the Democrats' case about Trump pressuring Ukraine, the withholding of aid, and the obstruction of Congress. Also, mention the Republican counterarguments about the process being unfair and the lack of direct evidence.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to highlight the moral perspectives from both sides without getting too bogged down in procedural details.

Let me structure it: start with Democrats' arguments, their moral stance, then Republicans' counterarguments, their moral framing, and end with the upcoming vote and the overall division it's causing.

Make sure to mention key figures like Nadler and Collins, and the articles of impeachment they're considering. Also, note that Trump denies any wrongdoing and that the Senate trial is unlikely to result in conviction.

I think that's the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the moral framing.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are building a moral case for impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden constitutes a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security. They accuse Trump of prioritizing personal interests over the country, violating his oath, and obstructing Congress. Republicans counter, framing the process as politically motivated and unfair, with Representative Doug Collins calling it a "presumption instead of truth." The hearing highlighted deep divisions, with Democrats emphasizing Trump's abuse of power by withholding aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to coerce investigations, while Republicans argue there's no direct evidence of wrongdoing. The House Judiciary Committee is set to vote on articles of impeachment, focusing on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump denies any misconduct, and his allies dismiss the inquiry as a Democratic hoax. The moral framing underscores a clash over whether Trump's actions threaten democracy or if the impeachment process itself is a political overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
