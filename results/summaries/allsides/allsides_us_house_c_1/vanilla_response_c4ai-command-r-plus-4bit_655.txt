SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats argued for impeaching President Donald Trump during a hearing on Monday, stating that his pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a threat to free elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote this week on formal impeachment charges, with the full House vote likely before Christmas. Democrats accused Trump of abusing power by withholding aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to pressure them to investigate Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival. The committee is focusing on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Republicans countered that the inquiry lacked direct evidence of wrongdoing and accused Democrats of seeking to impeach Trump due to policy disagreements. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, calling the process unfair. The outcome of the impeachment vote in the House is expected, with no Republican support for impeachment thus far. If impeached, Trump would face a trial in the Senate, where a conviction is considered unlikely.
