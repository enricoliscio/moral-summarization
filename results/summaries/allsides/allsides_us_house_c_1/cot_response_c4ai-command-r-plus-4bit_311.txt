SUMMARY: Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are seeking to impeach President Donald Trump, arguing that he has committed wrongdoing by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. They describe his actions as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security, accusing him of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. The Democrats claim that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting as leverage to coerce Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 U.S. election. Republicans have fired back, objecting to the hearing and claiming that there is no evidence of impeachable offenses, calling the process unfair and fanciful. They argue that Democrats are desperate to impeach Trump due to policy disagreements and that the case against him is based on unestablished allegations and collusion. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing by the President. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote this week on formal impeachment charges, setting the stage for a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate where conviction is considered unlikely.
