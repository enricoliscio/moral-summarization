SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Joe Biden, and obstructing Congress' investigation. In a heated hearing, Democrats presented evidence of Trump's wrongdoing, calling it a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. Republicans countered, saying the inquiry is unfair and lacks evidence. The hearing is a key step towards determining impeachment charges, which the full House is likely to vote on before Christmas. If Trump is impeached, a trial would be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office. The impeachment battle centers on whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the probe a hoax.
