SUMMARY:
U.S. Democrats sought to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, describing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. Democrats argued that Trump's actions were a "wrongdoing" and a "hoax", and that he has "broken his oath" and put himself before his country. Republicans fired back, calling the inquiry "unfair" and "fanciful", and accusing Democrats of being "desperate" to impeach Trump. The hearing was disrupted by a man who shouted that Democrats were committing "treason". The impeachment battle centers around whether Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress' investigation. Democrats intend to decide which articles to bring forward, while Republicans have branded the impeachment inquiry a "baloney" effort. END OF SUMMARY.
