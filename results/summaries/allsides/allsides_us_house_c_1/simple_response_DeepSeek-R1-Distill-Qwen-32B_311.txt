Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about the U.S. Democrats pushing for the impeachment of President Trump. They argue that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, which they see as a threat to free elections and national security. The hearing was quite heated, with Republicans opposing the impeachment, calling it a desperate move by Democrats. The key issues are whether Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress. The Democrats are gathering evidence, while the White House is refusing to participate, claiming the process is unfair. The outcome is uncertain, with the possibility of the House voting on impeachment charges and the Senate holding a trial.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The Democrats present Trump's actions as a clear danger to democracy and national security, emphasizing his self-interest over the country. Republicans counter by saying the process is unfair and that Democrats are acting out of desperation, not truth. The summary should reflect both sides' moral arguments.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: the Democrats' case, the Republicans' response, the focus on the two articles of impeachment, the process details, and the underlying moral perspectives. Keeping it under 200 words and using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the moral framing from both parties. I'll mention the Democrats' view of Trump's actions as a danger and the Republicans' dismissal of the charges as baseless. Also, note the process steps and the unlikely conviction in the Senate.

I need to ensure the summary is concise but covers all key elements without getting too detailed. I'll avoid specific names unless necessary and focus on the moral arguments each side presents.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are advancing the case for impeaching President Trump, alleging his pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden constitutes a threat to democracy and national security. They argue Trump prioritized personal interests over the country, violating his duties. Republicans counter, dismissing the charges as politically motivated and unfair, with no evidence of wrongdoing. The hearing focused on potential articles of impeachment for abuse of power and obstructing Congress. Democrats highlight Trump's withholding of aid from Ukraine and his July phone call as key evidence, while Republicans argue the case lacks substance. The process remains contentious, with the House likely voting on charges before the Senate trial, which is unlikely to result in conviction. The moral debate centers on Trump's actions' impact on democracy versus the fairness of the impeachment process. END OF SUMMARY.
