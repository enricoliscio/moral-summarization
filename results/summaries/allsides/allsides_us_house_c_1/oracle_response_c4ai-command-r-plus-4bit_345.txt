SUMMARY: Democrats sought to strengthen the case for impeaching President Trump, arguing that his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee hearing was disrupted by Republicans' objections and a protester shouting about treason. Democrats accused Trump of violating his oath by abusing his power and withholding aid to Ukraine while seeking investigations of the Bidens. The White House denied any wrongdoing, calling the impeachment inquiry unfair. The committee's top Democrat, Jerrold Nadler, said Trump had put himself before his country and broken his oath, while Republicans argued there was no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. Democrats intend to decide on formal charges, or articles of impeachment, after the hearing, with a full House vote likely before Christmas. The impeachment battle has divided Americans, with no House Republicans supporting impeachment and the White House refusing to participate in the hearings. The Justice Department's watchdog found no political bias in the FBI's probe of Trump's campaign contacts with Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
