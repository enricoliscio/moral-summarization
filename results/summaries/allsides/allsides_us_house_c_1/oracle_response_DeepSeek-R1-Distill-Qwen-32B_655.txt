Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that they want the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about the U.S. Democrats pushing for the impeachment of President Trump, highlighting his actions towards Ukraine. The author uses words like "pressuring," "danger," "wrongdoing," and others that carry moral weight. My task is to condense this into a summary without losing the ethical implications.

First, I'll identify the main events: Democrats argue Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, which they see as a danger to elections and national security. They've gathered evidence, and there's a hearing with potential impeachment votes. Republicans are opposing, calling it a presumption without truth.

I need to include terms like "pressuring," "danger," "wrongdoing," "put," "violated," "broken," "presumption," "truth," "vote," "coerce," "cheat," "impeach," and "seek." I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the Democrats' case, then Republican responses, and the implications.

I'll make sure each morally framed word is appropriately placed. For example, Trump "pressured" Ukraine, which is a "danger." Democrats argue he "violated" his responsibilities and "broken" his oath. Republicans counter with "presumption" and "truth." The summary should end with the potential vote and the ongoing conflict.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points. I'll avoid adding any new information beyond what's in the article and focus on the moral aspects highlighted.

Putting it all together, the summary should start with Democrats' case, mention the hearing, include the moral terms, and conclude with the expected vote and Republican opposition. I'll ensure each sentence flows into the next, maintaining the ethical framing throughout.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats argue that President Trump's actions, including pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, constitute a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They claim Trump has violated his responsibilities and broken his oath, putting his interests above the country. Republicans counter, accusing Democrats of using presumption over truth and seeking impeachment out of desperation. The hearing, disrupted by a man shouting "treason," focused on whether Trump abused his power by coercing Ukraine and obstructing Congress. Democrats accuse Trump of withholding aid to Ukraine as leverage, while Republicans argue there's no direct evidence of wrongdoing. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on articles of impeachment, which could lead to a trial in the Senate. Democrats warn that leaving Trump in office risks further undermining U.S. elections, while Republicans dismiss the case as based on a small part of a phone call transcript. The moral framing underscores the conflict between Democrats seeking impeachment and Republicans defending Trump's actions as legitimate. END OF SUMMARY.
