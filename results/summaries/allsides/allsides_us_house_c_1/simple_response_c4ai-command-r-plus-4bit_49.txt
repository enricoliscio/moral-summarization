SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats on Monday made their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, characterizing his solicitation of Ukraine to investigate a political opponent as a severe threat to free and fair elections and national security. Describing Trump's actions as a "clear and present danger," the Democrats argued that the president had put his interests ahead of the country and violated his oath of office. Republicans countered that the Democrats were conducting a partisan impeachment without any evidence of impeachable offenses, accusing them of seeking to unseat a duly elected president. The hearing, marked by raucous exchanges and parliamentary tactics, sets the stage for a likely vote on impeachment charges in the House before Christmas. At the heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on formal charges by the end of the week, with a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate likely to follow if Trump is impeached. The White House has dismissed the proceedings as unfair and refused to participate.
