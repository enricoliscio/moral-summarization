SUMMARY:

US Democrats sought to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, describing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The top Democrat on the panel, Jerrold Nadler, stated that there was extensive proof of Trump's wrongdoing, violating his oath and putting himself before his country. Republicans fired back, accusing Democrats of desperation and presumption over truth. The hearing was disrupted by a man who shouted that Democrats were committing treason. The heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the probe a hoax. Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his power, coercing a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election, and seek to impeach him for his actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
