Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I should make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. Democrats pushing for Trump's impeachment, focusing on his pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. The key moral terms here are "pressuring," "danger," "wrongdoing," "put," "violated," "broken," "presumption," "truth," "vote," "coerce," "cheat," "impeach," and "seek."

I should structure the summary to highlight the Democrats' arguments using these terms. They describe Trump's actions as a "clear and present danger" to elections and national security. Representative Nadler's statement about Trump putting himself before the country and violating his responsibilities is crucial. 

On the other side, Republicans are opposing, using terms like "presumption" instead of truth and calling the Democrats desperate. The article also mentions the potential vote on impeachment charges and the lack of support from Republicans. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Democrats' case, Republican opposition, the nature of the charges, and the political divide. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to reflect the author's perspective.

Let me draft this, ensuring that each key point is covered and the moral language is preserved. I'll start with the Democrats' actions, mention the charges, include the Republicans' counterarguments, and conclude with the political implications. 

I should also check the word count to stay within limits. Once the summary is done, I'll make sure it's clear and accurately reflects the article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are intensifying their push to impeach President Donald Trump, framing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. Representative Jerrold Nadler accused Trump of putting himself before the country, violating his responsibilities, and breaking his oath. Republicans countered, calling the Democrats' case based on "presumption" rather than truth, and branding the effort as desperate to impeach Trump. The hearing highlighted Trump's alleged abuse of power by withholding aid to Ukraine to coerce an investigation into Biden, whom Democrats argue is a clear and present danger to U.S. elections. Republicans denied any wrongdoing, with Representative Doug Collins dismissing the Democrats' claims as "baloney." The House Judiciary Committee is set to vote on articles of impeachment, which would likely set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. The divide over Trump's actions, including his alleged attempt to cheat in the 2020 election, remains sharp, with Democrats seeking to impeach him while Republicans defend his presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
