Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about the U.S. impeachment proceedings. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee pushing for impeachment of Trump, citing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden as a danger to elections and national security. They presented extensive evidence, with Rep. Nadler making strong statements. Republicans are opposing, questioning the process and the evidence. The hearing was disruptive, with a man shouting and being removed. Trump denies any wrongdoing and claims it's a hoax. The focus is on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats argue Trump withheld aid to pressure Ukraine, while Republicans say there's no direct evidence. The committee is set to vote on charges this week, with the Senate trial likely if impeached. The article also mentions the Mueller report and the Justice Department's findings on the FBI probe. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main actors, the charges, the arguments from both sides, and the next steps. I'll make sure to cover Democrats' accusations, Republicans' counterarguments, the procedural aspects, and the implications of the vote.

Let me structure it: start with Democrats' push for impeachment, their reasons, Republicans' response, mention the disruptive hearing, Trump's denial, the two articles, the evidence points, and the expected vote. Also, note the split among Americans and the unlikely conviction in the Senate.

I should keep it concise, ensuring each key point is covered without getting too detailed. Avoiding specific quotes unless necessary. Make sure the summary flows logically from the hearing to the potential outcomes.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are advancing the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, accusing him of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, which they claim endangers free elections and national security. In a heated House Judiciary Committee hearing, Democrats presented evidence alleging Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to coerce an investigation into Biden and his son. Republicans countered, questioning the process and evidence, with some arguing the case relies on minimal evidence from a phone call transcript. Trump denies any wrongdoing, calling the probe a hoax. The committee is expected to vote this week on articles of impeachment, focusing on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. If impeached, a Senate trial would follow, though conviction is unlikely. The hearing highlighted divisions among Americans, with Democrats warning of threats to democracy and Republicans dismissing the inquiry as politically motivated. END OF SUMMARY.
