Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should include as many as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the U.S. Democrats pushing for the impeachment of President Trump. They're accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, which they see as a danger to free elections and national security. The hearing was chaotic, with Republicans opposing the charges. Trump denies any wrongdoing and claims it's a hoax. The Democrats argue that Trump's actions violate his duties as president, while Republicans say the process is unfair and based on presumption rather than truth. The summary should include words like pressuring, danger, wrongdoing, etc.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the morally charged terms. I'll structure it to highlight the Democrats' case, the Republicans' counterarguments, and the implications for the impeachment process. I'll also mention the key points like withholding aid, the phone call, and the lack of evidence from the Republicans' side.

Let me start by outlining the main points:

1. Democrats argue Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, posing a danger to elections and national security.
2. They claim Trump violated his duties and broke his oath.
3. Republicans counter that the process is unfair and based on presumption, not truth.
4. The focus is on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
5. Trump denied wrongdoing, and Republicans say there's no direct evidence.
6. The outcome could lead to impeachment in the House and a trial in the Senate, but conviction is unlikely.

Now, I'll craft the summary using the morally framed words, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures the essence of both sides.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats argue that President Trump's pressuring of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden constitutes a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security, violating his presidential duties and oath. They claim Trump's actions, including withholding aid and a White House meeting as leverage, amount to wrongdoing and abuse of power. Republicans counter, asserting the impeachment process is based on presumption rather than truth, with no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. The hearing highlighted Democrats' concerns about Trump's efforts to coerce a foreign nation to influence elections, while Republicans dismissed the case as politically motivated. The Judiciary Committee is set to vote on articles of impeachment, focusing on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and Republicans argue the inquiry is unfounded. The outcome could lead to impeachment in the House, followed by a Senate trial, though conviction is unlikely. END OF SUMMARY.
