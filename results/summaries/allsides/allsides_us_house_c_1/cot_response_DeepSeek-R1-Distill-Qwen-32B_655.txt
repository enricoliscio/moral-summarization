Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what moral framing means. It refers to the use of words that carry a moral judgment, like "wrongdoing," "abuse," or "treason." These words aren't just neutral; they imply right or wrong, good or bad.

Looking at the news article, I'll go through it paragraph by paragraph to pick out these words. I'll make a list as I go. For example, "impeachment" is a legal term but in this context, it's framed as a moral issue because it's about a president's actions being wrong. Similarly, "abuse of power" and "obstruction" are clear moral terms.

Once I've listed all the morally framed words, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the article while highlighting the moral aspects.

I should make sure the summary reflects the conflict between Democrats and Republicans, the accusations of wrongdoing, the obstruction of Congress, and the potential consequences of impeachment. I'll also need to mention the key points like the withheld aid to Ukraine and the phone call with the Ukrainian president.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and doesn't just list facts but conveys the moral stance each side is taking. For example, Democrats are framing Trump's actions as a danger to national security and elections, while Republicans are dismissing the charges as baseless.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to start with the main issue, the hearing, the arguments from both sides, and the potential next steps. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to maintain the original framing.

I think I've got a good grasp on this. Time to put it all together.

**SUMMARY:**  
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee held a heated hearing on Monday, with Democrats arguing that President Donald Trump’s actions, including pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, constitute a “clear and present danger” to free and fair elections and national security. Democrats accused Trump of abusing his power by withholding military aid from Ukraine and obstructing Congress’ investigation. Representative Jerrold Nadler stated that Trump had put himself above the country, violating his oath of office. Republicans, however, dismissed the charges as baseless, calling the process “desperate” and “baloney.” The hearing is a key step toward drafting articles of impeachment, which the House is expected to vote on before Christmas. If impeached, Trump would face a trial in the Senate, where conviction is unlikely. The debate centers on whether Trump’s actions, including a July phone call with Ukraine’s president, amount to impeachable offenses. Democrats argue Trump’s behavior undermines U.S. democracy, while Republicans claim the inquiry lacks evidence and is politically motivated. The summary of the Intelligence Committee’s 300-page report further supports Democrats’ case, while Republicans counter with their own report, dismissing the allegations as unfounded. END OF SUMMARY.
