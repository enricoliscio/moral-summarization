SUMMARY: Democrats in the United States House of Representatives are building a case for impeaching President Donald Trump, accusing him of wrongdoing and abuse of power. They argue that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and obstructed Congress' investigation into the matter. The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday laid the groundwork for formal impeachment charges, with Democrats describing Trump's actions as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. Republicans have branded the impeachment inquiry as a desperate attempt to unseat a president who has done nothing to merit removal from office. They argue that the case against Trump boils down to a small part of a phone call transcript and policy disagreements. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing or obstruction by the president. Democrats, however, believe Trump abused his power by withholding security aid and a White House meeting as leverage to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens. The Intelligence Committee's report further alleges sweeping abuse of power by the president. The House is expected to vote on formal charges before Christmas, setting the stage for a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. The impeachment battle has divided Americans, with no current House Republican supporting impeachment and the White House and its allies defending Trump's actions.
