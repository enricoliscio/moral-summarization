Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I'll have to be selective about the key points.

First, the article talks about Democrats pushing for impeachment, focusing on Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. They see this as a danger to elections and national security. I should mention that.

Then, there's the hearing where Democrats presented evidence, with Jerrold Nadler stating Trump violated his duties. Republicans objected, and there was some disruption. I'll note the main points from both sides.

The article also mentions the possible articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction. Democrats argue Trump withheld aid and a meeting to pressure Ukraine. I should include that.

Republicans, on the other hand, argue there's no evidence and it's a political move. The White House isn't participating, claiming the process is unfair. I'll make sure to include their stance.

The Mueller report angle is there but seems less emphasized now. Maybe I can skip that for brevity.

The summary needs to end with the potential next steps: the House Judiciary Committee voting on charges, leading to a Senate trial. I'll include that, noting that conviction is unlikely.

I should structure it to cover the main issues without getting bogged down in details. Keep it clear and to the point, under 200 words. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are advancing the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, alleging he endangered free elections and national security by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden. In a heated House Judiciary Committee hearing, Democrats presented evidence of Trump's wrongdoing, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler accusing Trump of prioritizing self-interest over the nation. Republicans objected, calling the process politically motivated and lacking evidence. The hearing focused on whether Trump abused power by withholding aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to coerce an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter. Democrats argue this constitutes abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Republicans, however, dismissed the claims, stating no direct evidence of impeachable offenses was found. The committee is expected to vote on articles of impeachment this week, potentially leading to a Senate trial. Conviction is unlikely, given the Republican majority in the Senate. The proceedings highlight deep divisions over Trump's actions and the fairness of the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
