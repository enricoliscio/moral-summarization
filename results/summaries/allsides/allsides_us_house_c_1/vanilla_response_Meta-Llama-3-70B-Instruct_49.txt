SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, citing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. In a heated hearing, Democrats presented extensive evidence of Trump's wrongdoing, while Republicans fired back with objections and parliamentary maneuvers. The hearing is a key step towards determining formal impeachment charges, which the full Democratic-controlled House is likely to vote on before Christmas. If Trump is impeached, a trial would be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be needed to remove him from office. The impeachment battle centers on whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the probe a hoax.
