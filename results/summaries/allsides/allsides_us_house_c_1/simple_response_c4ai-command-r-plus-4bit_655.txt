SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are pushing forward with their impeachment case against President Donald Trump, arguing that his pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival poses a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday laid the groundwork for a vote on formal impeachment charges later this week. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the panel, stated that Trump has put his own interests ahead of the country and violated his oath of office. Republicans strongly objected, calling the impeachment effort baseless and partisan. The heart of the impeachment inquiry centers on whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Democrats argue that Trump's actions pose a threat to the integrity of U.S. elections and national security, while Republicans counter that the case against Trump is weak and based on a small part of a phone call transcript. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing by the President. The House Judiciary panel is expected to vote on formal charges by the end of the week, setting the stage for a likely impeachment vote in the full House before Christmas. A trial would then be held in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be needed to remove Trump from office.
END OF SUMMARY.
