SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are pushing forward with impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, with a key hearing held on Monday by the House Judiciary Committee. The hearing focused on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, stemming from Trump's alleged pressuring of Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the panel, stated that Trump had violated his oath of office and endangered free and fair elections. Republicans strongly objected, arguing that the case against Trump was weak and based on presumptions rather than facts. The hearing was disrupted by a protester and marked by parliamentary maneuvers from Republicans. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, calling the process unfair. Democrats intend to decide on the final articles of impeachment after the hearing, with a vote expected by the end of the week. The full House is likely to vote on impeachment before Christmas, but a conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate is considered unlikely.
END OF SUMMARY.
