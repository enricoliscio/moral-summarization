Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The user provided a detailed article, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that Democrats are trying to build the case for impeachment, highlighting Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden. They see this as a threat to elections and national security. I should note that the hearing is part of the process before a possible vote on impeachment charges.

Next, there's a mention of Republicans opposing this, questioning the process and calling it desperate. They argue there's no real evidence of wrongdoing. I should include this to show the divide between the parties.

The article also talks about the specific charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats argue Trump withheld aid and a meeting with Ukraine's president to pressure them into investigating Biden. This is a crucial point to include.

Additionally, the article mentions that Mueller's report isn't being used as a basis for impeachment, which is important context. Also, the Republicans have their own report dismissing the charges, which I should note.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the main elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to cover the Democrats' case, Republican responses, the specific charges, and the broader context of the impeachment process.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are building the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, accusing him of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, which they argue threatens free elections and national security. A raucous hearing in the House Judiciary Committee highlighted divisions, with Democrats presenting extensive evidence of wrongdoing and Republicans dismissing the probe as politically motivated. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and the White House has boycotted the hearings, calling the process unfair. The committee is expected to vote this week on articles of impeachment, likely focusing on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Republicans argue there's no evidence of impeachable offenses, with some claiming the case rests on a minor part of Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president. If impeachment is approved by the Democratic-controlled House, a trial would proceed in the Republican-controlled Senate, where conviction is unlikely. The proceedings mark the first major impeachment battle since Bill Clinton's in 1998. END OF SUMMARY.
