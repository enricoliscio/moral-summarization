SUMMARY:
U.S. Democrats sought to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, describing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The top Democrat on the panel said there was extensive proof of Trump's "wrongdoing", accusing him of breaking his oath and putting himself before his country. Republicans fired back, calling the inquiry a "hoax" and claiming Democrats were "desperate" to impeach Trump. The hearing was disrupted by a man who shouted that Democrats were committing "treason". The impeachment battle centers on whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Democrats argue that leaving Trump in office would open the door to further undermining of the U.S. electoral process. END OF SUMMARY.
