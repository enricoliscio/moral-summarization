SUMMARY:
Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee are seeking to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, describing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They argue that Trump has put himself before his country, violating his oath and committing "wrongdoing". Republicans, on the other hand, fired back, calling the inquiry a "hoax" and claiming that Democrats are "desperate" to impeach Trump. The hearing was marked by objections and parliamentary maneuvers, with one man shouting that Democrats were committing "treason". The committee is expected to vote on formal charges, known as articles of impeachment, which could lead to a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump denies any "wrongdoing" and has called the probe a "hoax". END OF SUMMARY.
