SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats sought to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, describing his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a “clear and present danger.” The hearing on Monday was a key step before determining charges, known as articles of impeachment, with the House Judiciary panel expected to vote by the end of the week on whether to send formal charges to the full House. The heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress' investigation by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats argue that Trump withheld aid and a White House meeting as leverage, while Republicans claim there is no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing by Trump. Democrats intend to decide on specific articles of impeachment after Monday’s hearing, showcasing their 300-page report alleging sweeping abuse of power by Trump. Republicans have countered with their own report, arguing that the inquiry relies on subjective interpretations and presents no evidence of impeachable offenses. 
END OF SUMMARY.
