SUMMARY: 
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee heard arguments on Monday regarding the impeachment of President Donald Trump, with Democrats asserting that his actions pose a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security. The hearing focused on Trump's alleged abuse of power in pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and the subsequent obstruction of Congress' investigation. Democrats characterized Trump's actions as a violation of his oath of office and a threat to the integrity of U.S. elections. Republicans countered that the Democrats' case was based on a misinterpretation of a phone call and that there was no evidence of impeachable offenses. The committee is expected to vote on formal charges by the end of the week, setting the stage for a trial in the Senate. The White House has denied any wrongdoing and refused to participate in the hearings. The impeachment inquiry has revealed a stark divide among Americans, with Democrats accusing Trump of abuse of power and Republicans defending his actions. The outcome of the impeachment process remains uncertain, but it has already left an indelible mark on Trump's presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
