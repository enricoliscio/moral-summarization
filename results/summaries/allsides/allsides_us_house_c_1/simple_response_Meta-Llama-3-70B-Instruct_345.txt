SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, citing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee hearing was marked by partisan clashes, with Republicans accusing Democrats of desperation and treason. Democrats argue that Trump abused his power by withholding aid to Ukraine and obstructing Congress' investigation, violating his oath and putting his interests above the country's. Republicans claim there is no evidence of wrongdoing and that the inquiry is unfair and biased. The committee is expected to vote on formal impeachment charges by the end of the week, which would set up a clash with the White House and Republican allies. The moral framing of the article emphasizes the gravity of Trump's actions, portraying him as a threat to democratic values and national security.
