SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats on Monday sought to bolster the impeachment case against President Donald Trump, arguing that his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security. In a heated hearing, the House Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Jerrold Nadler, said Trump had "put himself before his country" and violated his oath of office. Republicans countered that Democrats were desperate to impeach Trump and had no evidence of impeachable offenses. The committee is focused on two articles of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction. Democrats argue that Trump abused his power by withholding aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rival, Joe Biden. Republicans dismiss the case as baseless and motivated by policy disagreements. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing by Trump. Democrats intend to decide on the specific articles of impeachment after Monday's hearing, which showcased dueling reports by the Intelligence Committee majority and minority.
END OF SUMMARY.
