SUMMARY:
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are pushing forward with impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, arguing that his actions pose a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday centered around allegations that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the panel, stated that Trump "has put himself before his country" and "broken his oath." Republicans vehemently objected, claiming that Democrats were engaging in a partisan effort to unseat a duly elected president without any evidence of wrongdoing. The committee is expected to vote this week on formal charges, which would then be sent to the full House for a vote. If impeached, Trump would face a trial in the Senate, where conviction is considered unlikely. The impeachment battle revolves around allegations of abuse of power and obstruction, with Democrats accusing Trump of using his office to coerce a foreign country to interfere in U.S. elections and Republicans dismissing the inquiry as baseless and politically motivated. The White House has refused to participate in the process, denying any wrongdoing by the president.
