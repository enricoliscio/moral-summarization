SUMMARY: Democrats in the US House of Representatives are pushing forward with their impeachment case against President Donald Trump, describing his actions as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The hearing on Monday laid the groundwork for a vote on formal impeachment charges, with Representative Jerrold Nadler stating that Trump has "put himself before his country" and "violated his oath" by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Republicans strongly objected, accusing Democrats of undermining the truth and engaging in a desperate attempt to unseat a duly elected president. The hearing focused on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats argue that Trump withheld aid and a White House meeting as leverage to coerce Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 election by investigating Biden and his son. Republicans countered that the case is based on a small part of a phone call and that Democrats are seeking to impeach Trump simply because they disagree with him. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing by the president. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on formal charges by the end of the week, setting the stage for a historic impeachment vote in the full House before Christmas.
END OF SUMMARY.
