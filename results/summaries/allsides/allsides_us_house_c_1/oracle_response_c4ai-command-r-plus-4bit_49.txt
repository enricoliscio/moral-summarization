SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats sought to strengthen the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing that his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The hearing was marked by passionate arguments and parliamentary tactics from both sides. Democrats accused Trump of violating his oath of office by abusing his power and withholding aid to Ukraine while seeking investigations of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Republicans countered that there was no direct evidence of impeachable offenses and that Democrats were desperate to impeach Trump due to policy disagreements. The White House maintained that there was no wrongdoing by the President. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on formal charges against Trump by the end of the week, with a full House vote likely before Christmas. The impeachment battle has divided Americans, centering on whether Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress. Democrats also appear to be backing away from including collusion allegations from the Mueller report as a basis for impeachment. The outcome of the impeachment process remains uncertain, with a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate likely if the House votes to impeach Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
