SUMMARY:

US Democrats are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, which they claim is a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. In a heated hearing, Democrats presented evidence of Trump's wrongdoing, while Republicans fired back, calling the inquiry a "hoax" and accusing Democrats of being "desperate" to impeach the president. The hearing is a key step towards determining formal impeachment charges, which the full House is likely to vote on before Christmas. If impeached, Trump would face a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be needed to remove him from office. The impeachment battle centers on whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation.
