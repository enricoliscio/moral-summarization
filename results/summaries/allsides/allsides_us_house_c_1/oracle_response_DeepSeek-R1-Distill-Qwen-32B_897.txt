Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the impeachment proceedings against Trump. The author used words like "pressuring," "danger," "wrongdoing," etc., which I need to include.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Democrats are pushing for impeachment, citing Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden. They see this as a danger to elections and national security. Republicans are opposing, calling the process unfair and Democrats desperate.

I need to mention the specific charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Also, the fact that Trump withheld military aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president. The Democrats argue this is a clear and present danger, while Republicans dismiss it as a political move.

I should include the moral terms like "abuse," "coerce," "cheat," and "impeach." Also, mention the lack of evidence Republicans point out and the political divide in the country.

I'll structure the summary to include the main actions, the moral arguments from both sides, and the procedural steps like the vote on articles of impeachment. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to use the specified moral words.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are pressing for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, arguing his actions in pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden pose a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They accuse Trump of wrongdoing, violating his duties, and breaking his oath of office by putting himself above the country. Republicans counter, claiming the process is presumption-driven and lacks truth, with Representative Doug Collins calling the Democrats' efforts desperate. The hearing focused on whether Trump abused his power by coercing Ukraine to investigate Biden and obstructing Congress, including withholding $391 million in security aid and a White House meeting as leverage. Democrats argue Trump's actions threaten the electoral process, while Republicans dismiss the case as based on a small part of a phone call transcript. The proceedings highlight the deep political divide, with Democrats seeking impeachment and Republicans defending Trump against what they see as a politically motivated effort. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on articles of impeachment by the end of the week. END OF SUMMARY.
