SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats on Monday made their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing that his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. Describing Trump's actions as putting himself before his country and violating his oath, Democrats presented evidence of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Republicans countered that the inquiry had found no direct evidence of impeachable offenses and accused Democrats of seeking impeachment due to policy disagreements. The hearing, disrupted briefly by a man shouting about treason, sets the stage for a likely impeachment vote in the Democratic-controlled House before Christmas. If impeached, Trump would face a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, where conviction is considered unlikely. The impeachment battle centers on whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and obstructed Congress' investigation. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing. Democrats argue that Trump's actions undermine U.S. elections and national security, while Republicans defend Trump, stating that impeaching him would be based on a "baloney" interpretation of a phone call transcript. The Justice Department's watchdog found errors but no political bias in the FBI's probe of Trump's campaign contacts with Russia. Democrats plan to decide on specific articles of impeachment after the hearing.
END OF SUMMARY.
