SUMMARY: 
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee held a raucous hearing on Monday as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, with Democrats arguing that his actions pose a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The hearing focused on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats accuse Trump of withholding aid to Ukraine and leveraging a White House meeting to pressure the country into investigating his political rival, Joe Biden. Republicans dismissed the inquiry as a partisan effort based on flimsy evidence, arguing that Trump's actions do not amount to impeachable offenses. The committee's top Democrat, Jerrold Nadler, described Trump's actions as a violation of his oath of office and a threat to the integrity of U.S. elections. The White House has denied any wrongdoing and refused to participate in the hearings. The House is expected to vote on formal impeachment charges before Christmas, with a trial likely to follow in the Republican-controlled Senate. The impeachment battle has divided Americans, with no House Republicans supporting impeachment thus far. The outcome will have significant implications for the future of American democracy and national security.
