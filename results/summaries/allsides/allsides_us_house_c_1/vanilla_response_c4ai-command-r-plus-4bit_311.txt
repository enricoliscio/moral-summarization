SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats on Monday made their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing that his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a "clear and present danger" to free elections and national security. The House Judiciary Committee heard arguments for two articles of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats accused Trump of withholding aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine to pressure them to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Republicans countered that the inquiry had found no direct evidence of impeachable offenses and accused Democrats of seeking to impeach Trump due to policy disagreements. The hearing was disrupted by a man shouting that Democrats were committing treason, and the White House denied any wrongdoing by Trump. The committee is expected to vote by the end of the week on whether to send formal charges to the full House. If impeached, Trump would face a trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed for conviction, which is considered unlikely.
END OF SUMMARY.
