SUMMARY:

Democrats in the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee are pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment, citing his pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival as a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. They argue that Trump has put himself above the country, violating his oath and basic responsibilities to the people. Republicans, on the other hand, claim that the impeachment inquiry is unfair and lacks factual evidence, with one calling it "baloney". The heart of the issue is whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress' investigation. Trump denies wrongdoing, calling the probe a hoax. The committee is expected to vote on formal charges by the end of the week, which would set up a clash with the White House and its Republican allies.
