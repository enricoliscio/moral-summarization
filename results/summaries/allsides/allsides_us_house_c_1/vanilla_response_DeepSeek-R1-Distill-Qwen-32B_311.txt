Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Democrats' efforts to impeach President Trump. The article is pretty detailed, so I should focus on the key points. 

First, the main event is the hearing in the House Judiciary Committee where Democrats are presenting their case for impeachment. They're arguing that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, which they see as a threat to election integrity and national security. 

I should note the accusations: Trump withheld military aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president to leverage an investigation. That's a clear abuse of power. Also, the Democrats are charging him with obstructing Congress by not cooperating with the inquiry.

On the other side, Republicans are opposing this, saying there's no real evidence and it's all a political move. They're using parliamentary tactics to disrupt the hearing. Also, the White House isn't participating, claiming the process is unfair.

The article mentions that if the House votes to impeach, the Senate would hold a trial, but conviction is unlikely. There's also a bit about Mueller's report and the 2016 election interference, but the Democrats aren't using that as a basis for impeachment now.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I should include the main arguments from both sides, the process in the House, and the possible outcome. Make sure to highlight the key points without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: U.S. Democrats are advancing their case for impeaching President Donald Trump, accusing him of abusing power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, which they claim threatens free elections and national security. At a contentious House Judiciary Committee hearing, Democrats presented extensive evidence, with Representative Jerrold Nadler stating Trump prioritized self-interest over his duties. Republicans opposed the claims, calling the process unfair and politically motivated. The hearing focused on two potential articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump has denied wrongdoing, and the White House has boycotted the proceedings. If the House approves impeachment charges, a Senate trial would follow, but conviction is unlikely. The case hinges on Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine and withholding of aid, with Democrats warning of risks to democracy. Republicans argue there's no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. The process remains deeply divided along party lines. END OF SUMMARY.
