SUMMARY: Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee sought to bolster the case for impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing that his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate a political rival posed a "clear and present danger" to free and fair elections and national security. The hearing on Monday was a key step before determining formal impeachment charges, with the committee expected to vote by the end of the week on whether to send them to the full House. The heart of the impeachment battle is whether Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress by pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden while withholding aid and a White House meeting as leverage. Democrats described Trump's actions as a violation of his oath of office and a threat to the integrity of U.S. elections. Republicans fired back, calling the impeachment inquiry unfair and arguing that there was no direct evidence of impeachable offenses. The White House has refused to participate in the hearings, denying any wrongdoing by Trump. The committee is focused on two articles of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats intend to decide which articles to bring forward after Monday's hearing.
END OF SUMMARY.
