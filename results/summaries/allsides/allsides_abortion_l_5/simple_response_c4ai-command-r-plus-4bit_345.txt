SUMMARY: On Thursday, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This came after a more extreme bill banning "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans, who argued that it was too restrictive and sent the wrong message to women and young people. The bill that passed on Thursday was approved in the previous Congress and prohibits federal taxpayer funds from being used for abortions. The vote coincided with the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld a woman's access to abortion based on privacy rights. While religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions expressed disappointment, centrist members argued that the House should focus on economic issues that have broader appeal to the public. The internal division within the GOP highlights a growing sentiment among members to pass legislation that makes a tangible difference to Americans, rather than taking symbolic votes on contentious social issues. The willingness of more moderate members to challenge their leaders may complicate future legislation on abortion and other social issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
