Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that carry moral connotations in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of those morally framed words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article carefully to spot words that carry moral weight. Words like "ban," "taxpayer," "abortions," "extreme," "opposed," "exceptions," "raped," "evidence," "unreported," "incest," "pro-life," "undermines," "health," "personal decisions," "restrictions," "unhappy," "respect," "best moment," "centrist," "message," "appeal," "symbolic," "campaign ads," "riled up," "disappointed," and "commitment" all seem to carry moral implications.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It needs to be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key events: the House passing the bill, the initial proposal being withdrawn, the reasons behind the withdrawal, the reactions from different groups, and the implications for the Republican party. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I should also ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the bill's passage, moving to the initial proposal's fate, the internal conflicts within the GOP, and the broader implications. I'll highlight the opposing views, such as Pelosi's criticism and the religious activists' disappointment. Finally, I'll mention the shift towards more centrist policies and the ongoing debates within the party.

I need to keep the language clear and concise, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details. Let me piece it together, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  
The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, following the withdrawal of a more extreme bill targeting "late-term" abortions. Moderate Republicans opposed the original bill due to its strict requirements for rape exceptions, arguing it sent a harmful message. The revised bill, barring federal funds for abortions, passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining Republicans. The White House vowed to veto the legislation. Meanwhile, anti-abortion activists gathered for the "March for Life," marking the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade. GOP leaders faced criticism for prioritizing abortion debates over job creation, with some members advocating for a shift toward centrist policies. The decision to pull the original bill was seen as a win for moderate voices, though religious activists were disappointed. The ongoing debate highlights internal GOP divisions and the challenge of balancing social issues with broader economic priorities. END OF SUMMARY.
