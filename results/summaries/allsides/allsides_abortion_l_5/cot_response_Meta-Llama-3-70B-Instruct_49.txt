SUMMARY:
The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer money for abortions, a move that was met with opposition from moderate Republicans who deemed it too extreme. The bill was a backup plan after a more restrictive measure, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was pulled due to concerns over its provision requiring women to report rape to the police in order to access an abortion. Female GOP members, led by Rep. Renee Ellmers, argued that this provision was unfair, as many rapes go unreported. The White House has promised to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. The move was criticized by Democrats, who argued that the GOP was prioritizing anti-abortion rights over job creation and undermining the health of American women. Religious activists were also unhappy with the decision, with Dr. Russell Moore calling it "not the best moment for the House Republicans." END OF SUMMARY.
