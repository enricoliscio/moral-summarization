SUMMARY:
On Thursday, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This was a backup plan after a bill banning so-called "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans who deemed it too extreme. The bill, which passed 242-179 with support from three Democrats, bars federal taxpayer funds for abortions. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event and the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld a woman's access to abortion. While religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions praised the bill, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized it for undermining women's health and focusing on contentious social issues instead of job creation. The bill's passage highlights the growing tension within the GOP between centrist members who want to focus on economic messages and those who prioritize symbolic votes on social issues. The willingness of members in competitive districts to challenge their leaders may complicate future legislation. The late-term abortion bill, which included a controversial provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access an abortion, was opposed by female GOP members and some male members. Despite the setback, anti-abortion activists remain committed to their cause and plan to bring the 20-week abortion ban bill back to the floor.
END OF SUMMARY.
