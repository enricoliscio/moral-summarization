SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but a more contentious bill banning so-called "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill that passed, which would ban federal funding for abortions, was approved by a vote of 242-179, with three Democrats joining House Republicans in support. The White House has promised to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life," marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision that upheld a woman's access to abortion. Initially, Republican leaders planned to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," which would ban abortion procedures after 20 weeks. However, female GOP members led by Rep. Renee Ellmers opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report in order to access an abortion. Male members also agreed that this provision was unacceptable, and leaders ultimately decided to withdraw the bill. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, arguing that the bill undermines women's health and personal decisions. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions expressed disappointment with the GOP leadership's decision to cancel the vote. The move was seen as a win for centrist members who want the party to spend less time on contentious social issues and more time on broader economic messages ahead of the 2016 election.
