Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words they listed. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about the GOP-controlled House passing a bill to ban taxpayer money for abortions. They initially wanted to pass a more restrictive bill on "late-term" abortions but withdrew it due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill that passed was about federal funds, and the White House promised a veto. There's also mention of the March for Life and the Roe v. Wade anniversary.

I need to include the morally charged words like "banning," "upheld," "raped," "rapes," "incest," "pro-life," "rape," "putting," "undermines," "worse," "affected," "affects," "wrong," "sent," "less," "difference," "symbolic," "ban." 

I'll structure the summary by first stating the main event: the House passing the ban on taxpayer abortion funding. Then mention the initial attempt with the "late-term" bill being withdrawn because of moderate opposition. Highlight the reasons, like the provision requiring police reports for rape exceptions, which some found problematic. Include the internal GOP conflict and Pelosi's criticism. Finally, note the reaction from religious groups and the shift in focus towards more symbolic issues over economic ones.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear through the use of the specified words. I'll ensure that each key point is covered without going into too much detail, maintaining the summary's brevity.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning federal taxpayer money for abortions, following the withdrawal of a more restrictive "late-term" abortion ban due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill, which passed 242-179, aimed to bar federal funds for abortions, with three Democrats supporting it. The White House vowed to veto the legislation. The vote coincided with the annual March for Life, marking the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision upholding abortion rights. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks, but opposition arose over a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports for exceptions, with critics arguing it undermines women's rights. Moderate Republicans, including Rep. Renee Ellmers, opposed the measure, deeming it too extreme. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, calling the bill worse than the one withdrawn. Religious activists were disappointed, while some Republicans argued the bill sent the wrong message, especially to women and young people. The decision to pull the bill was seen as a win for centrist members, with Rep. Charlie Dent noting the party should focus on broader economic issues. The debate highlighted internal GOP divisions, with some members prioritizing legislation that makes a real difference over symbolic votes. END OF SUMMARY.
