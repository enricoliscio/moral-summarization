Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the GOP-controlled House passing a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions. They initially tried to pass a bill targeting "late-term" abortions but had to pull it because moderate Republicans thought it was too extreme. The bill they ended up passing was about federal funds, which passed with some Democrats supporting it. The White House is against it and plans to veto.

The original bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was opposed by some female GOP members because it required rape victims to file police reports for an abortion. Moderate Republicans argued this was unfair, especially since many rapes go unreported. They felt the bill sent a bad message, especially with the 2016 election approaching. Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation.

Some religious groups were unhappy because they wanted stricter abortion laws. The decision to pull the bill was a win for centrists who wanted to focus on more economic issues. The House ended up passing a different bill, but there's still tension among Republicans about how to handle abortion legislation.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The article highlights the conflict between pro-life and moderate Republicans, the concerns about the bill's impact on women, and the political implications for the GOP. I should make sure these points are included in the summary, emphasizing the moral arguments on both sides.

I should also keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Let me outline the key points:

1. House passes bill banning federal funds for abortions after pulling a more restrictive one.
2. The initial bill was too extreme, especially the requirement for rape victims to file police reports.
3. Moderate Republicans opposed it, fearing it alienates voters, especially women.
4. Pelosi criticized the focus on abortion over job creation.
5. Religious groups were unhappy with the decision to pull the bill.
6. The political strategy aspect: centrists wanted to avoid bad messaging before the election.
7. The eventual bill passed, but there's tension and potential future legislative challenges.

I'll make sure each of these points is covered concisely, highlighting the moral and political implications as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning federal taxpayer funds for abortions, after a more restrictive bill targeting "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," faced criticism for requiring rape victims to file police reports to access abortions, which many saw as unfair and insensitive. Moderate Republicans argued the bill sent a harmful message, particularly to women and young people, at a time when the party aims to expand its support ahead of the 2016 election. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, calling the legislation harmful to women's health and autonomy. Religious activists were失望 at the decision to pull the bill, while centrists welcomed the move, preferring to focus on broader economic issues. The eventual passage of the taxpayer funding ban, with some Democratic support, highlights ongoing tensions within the GOP over abortion legislation and its political implications. END OF SUMMARY.
