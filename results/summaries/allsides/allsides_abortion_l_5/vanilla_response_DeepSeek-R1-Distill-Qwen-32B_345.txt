Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by the GOP (Republicans). They passed a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions. But before that, they had another bill targeting "late-term" abortions, which was pulled because moderate Republicans thought it was too extreme.

The bill that passed, 242-179, prohibits federal funds for abortions. Three Democrats supported it. The White House said they'd veto it if it reached the President. The vote happened during the "March for Life" event, which is on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.

Initially, they wanted to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," which would ban abortions after 20 weeks. It was approved in 2013 but this time, some GOP members, especially women like Renee Ellmers, opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports. They felt it was unrealistic because most rapes aren't reported. Some male members agreed.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of jobs. Religious activists were unhappy the bill was pulled, thinking it was a bad move, especially during the March for Life. Moderate Republicans argued the bill sent a bad message and distracted from economic issues.

Speaker Boehner has had issues with conservatives before. With more female members, the GOP might face more challenges in passing such bills. Some members, like Curbelo, want to focus on legislation that makes a real difference. Rep. Franks, the bill's author, was disappointed but confident it would pass eventually.

So, the key points are: House passes a federal abortion funding ban, another bill was pulled due to opposition, moderate Republicans played a role, criticism from Pelosi and religious groups, and the impact on the GOP's legislative agenda.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and reasons behind the bill's passage and the internal GOP conflicts.
