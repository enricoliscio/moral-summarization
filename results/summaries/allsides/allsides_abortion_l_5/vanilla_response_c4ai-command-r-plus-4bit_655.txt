SUMMARY: On Thursday, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This was a backup plan after a more controversial bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans who felt it was too extreme. The bill that passed, which bars federal taxpayer funding for abortions, was approved in the previous Congress and passed with a vote of 242-179, with three Democrats joining House Republicans in support. The White House has vowed to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event on the National Mall, marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," faced opposition from female GOP members who argued that its provision requiring rape victims to file a police report in order to obtain an abortion was unreasonable and insensitive. Some male members agreed, and leaders ultimately decided to strip the provision. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, while religious activists pushing for abortion restrictions expressed disappointment with the leadership's decision to cancel the vote on the initial bill. The late-night decision was a win for centrist members who felt the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people. END OF SUMMARY.
