SUMMARY:
GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but a more extreme bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill that passed bars federal taxpayer funds for abortions and was approved with support from most Republicans and three Democrats. This vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event and the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, a Supreme Court decision upholding women's access to abortion. Republican leaders initially planned to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," banning abortions after 20 weeks, but a group of female GOP members led by Renee Ellmers opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access abortions. Some male members agreed, arguing that the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people about the GOP's stance on contentious social issues. The decision to pull the bill was a win for centrist members and a complication for future legislation, as more GOP members are challenging their leaders. Religious activists pushing for abortion restrictions expressed disappointment, and the White House promised to veto the legislation if it reached the President's desk. The bill's author, Rep. Trent Franks, expressed disappointment but remained confident in the House's commitment to anti-abortion rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
