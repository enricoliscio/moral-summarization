SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions, with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans in support. However, a more extreme bill banning "late-term" abortions was suddenly pulled due to moderate Republicans' concerns that it was too extreme. The pulled bill would have required women who were raped to show evidence of a police report to access an abortion, sparking criticism from female GOP members who argued that most rapes go unreported. The decision to pull the bill was seen as a rare win for centrist members, who argued that it sent the wrong message to women and young people. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions were unhappy with the decision, while Democrats criticized the GOP for spending time on the abortion debate instead of focusing on job creation. The bill banning taxpayer funds for abortions is likely to be vetoed by the President. END OF SUMMARY.
