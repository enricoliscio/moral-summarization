SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans in support. However, a more extreme bill banning "late-term" abortions was suddenly pulled due to backlash from moderate Republicans, who argued it was too extreme. The pulled bill would have required women who are raped to show evidence of a police report to access an abortion, sparking criticism from female GOP members who noted that most rapes go unreported. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for prioritizing the abortion debate over job creation measures, saying the bill "undermines the health of America's women" and affects millions of women. Religious activists were unhappy with the decision, while more centrist members saw it as a win, arguing that the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people. The debate highlights the GOP's internal divisions on social issues. END OF SUMMARY.
