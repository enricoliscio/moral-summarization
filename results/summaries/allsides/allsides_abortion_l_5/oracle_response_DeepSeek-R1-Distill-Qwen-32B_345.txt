Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the Republican-controlled House passing a bill to ban taxpayer funding for abortions, after another bill targeting "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. 

I notice the author uses several morally charged words like "banning," "pro-life," "raped," and "undermines." My goal is to include as many of these as possible in the summary. I'll start by identifying the key events: the passage of the taxpayer funding bill, the withdrawal of the late-term abortion bill, the reasons behind the withdrawal, and the reactions from various parties.

Next, I need to ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words. I'll focus on the main actions and the moral implications, such as the opposition from moderate Republicans over the rape provision, the criticism from Democrats, and the broader implications for the Republican party's image and legislative focus.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the legislative actions, the internal conflicts within the GOP, and the reactions from different groups. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to convey the tone and stance of each group involved.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the essence of the article while maintaining the moral framing as per the user's request. I'll check that all key points are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, after a more extreme bill targeting "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill barring federal taxpayer funds passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining Republicans in support. The White House vowed to veto the legislation. Meanwhile, the annual "March for Life" coincided with the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," aimed to ban abortions after 20 weeks but was withdrawn over concerns about a provision requiring rape survivors to provide evidence of a police report. Moderate Republicans, including Rep. Renee Ellmers, argued the provision was too extreme, as most rapes go unreported, especially in cases of incest. GOP leaders faced criticism for focusing on abortion debates instead of job creation. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi condemned the bill, stating it undermines women's health and personal decisions. Anti-abortion activists were失望, while centrist Republicans argued the bill sent the wrong message, particularly to women and young people, ahead of the 2016 election. The decision to pull the bill was seen as a win for more centrist members, who preferred focusing on broader economic issues. The controversy highlighted internal GOP divisions and the challenges of passing contentious social legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
