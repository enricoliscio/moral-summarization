SUMMARY: On the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This came after a bill banning "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans, including female GOP members who argued that it was too extreme and sent the wrong message to women and young people. The bill that passed, which was approved in the last Congress, bars federal taxpayer funds for abortions and was supported by all but one Republican and three Democrats. The White House vowed to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions criticized the Republican leadership's decision to cancel the vote on the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," which would have banned abortion procedures after 20 weeks into a pregnancy. The bill's author, Rep. Trent Franks, expressed disappointment but remains confident that the House will eventually hold a vote on it. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for prioritizing the abortion debate over job creation measures, arguing that the bill undermines women's health and personal decisions. The vote came as tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists gathered for the annual "March for Life" on the National Mall.
END OF SUMMARY.
