SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with 242 votes in favor and 179 against. The bill was a backup plan after a more restrictive bill, which would have banned abortions after 20 weeks, was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The pulled bill had a provision requiring women to report rapes to the police in order to access abortion services, which many deemed too extreme. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, which marks the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. Democratic leaders criticized the GOP for prioritizing abortion debates over job creation measures. The internal spat among Republicans has raised questions about the party's ability to pass legislation on contentious social issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
