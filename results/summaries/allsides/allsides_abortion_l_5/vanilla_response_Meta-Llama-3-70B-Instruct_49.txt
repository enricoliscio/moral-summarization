SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning federal taxpayer funds for abortions, with a 242-179 vote. The bill was a backup plan after a more restrictive measure, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The pulled bill would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but included a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access an abortion, which was deemed too extreme. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, which marks the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. Democratic leaders criticized the GOP for prioritizing abortion restrictions over job creation measures.
