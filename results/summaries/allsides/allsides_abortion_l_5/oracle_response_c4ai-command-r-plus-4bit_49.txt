SUMMARY: On Thursday, the GOP-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This move came after another proposal to ban "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans, who deemed it too extreme. The bill that passed, which was approved in the last Congress, prohibits federal taxpayer funds from being used for abortions. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life," an anti-abortion rights rally, and the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld a woman's access to abortion based on privacy rights. The initial plan to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," banning abortions after 20 weeks, was thwarted by a group of female GOP members who opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access an abortion. Some male members agreed, citing the need to respect women's accounts of rape. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, arguing that the bill undermines women's health and personal decisions. Religious activists pushing for abortion restrictions expressed disappointment with the GOP leadership's decision to cancel the vote. The article highlights the internal GOP struggle between centrist members who want to focus on broader economic messages and more conservative members who want to take symbolic votes on contentious social issues.
END OF SUMMARY.
