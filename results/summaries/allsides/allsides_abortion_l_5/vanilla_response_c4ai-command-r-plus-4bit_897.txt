SUMMARY: On Thursday, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This came after another proposal to ban "late-term" abortions was suddenly withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans who deemed it too extreme. The bill that passed bars federal taxpayer funds from being used for abortions and was approved with support from most House Republicans and three Democrats. The White House vowed to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event on the National Mall, marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. Republican leaders initially planned to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," but a group of female GOP members opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access an abortion. Some male members agreed, and leaders ultimately withdrew the bill. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation. Religious activists pushing for abortion restrictions expressed disappointment with the decision to cancel the vote. The bill's withdrawal was a win for centrist members who argued that the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people. The growing willingness of more moderate Republicans to challenge their leaders may complicate future legislation. Anti-abortion rights groups criticized Rep. Renee Ellmers for her role in opposing the bill.
END OF SUMMARY.
