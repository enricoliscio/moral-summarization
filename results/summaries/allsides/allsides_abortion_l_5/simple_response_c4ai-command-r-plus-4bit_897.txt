SUMMARY: The Republican-controlled House of Representatives in the United States passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This was a backup plan after a more extreme bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans who believed it was too restrictive, especially for victims of rape and incest. The bill that passed, barring federal taxpayer funds for abortions, was approved in the previous Congress and passed with a vote of 242-179. The White House has vowed to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, where tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists gathered to mark the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld a woman's access to abortion based on privacy rights. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," faced opposition from female GOP members who argued that the requirement to show evidence of a police report in cases of rape was unreasonable, given that many rapes go unreported. Some male members agreed, and leaders ultimately decided to strip the provision from the bill. The decision to cancel the vote on the initial bill was a victory for centrist members who believed it sent the wrong message to women and young people, and distracted from the party's broader economic agenda. The willingness of more centrist members to challenge their leaders on contentious social issues may complicate future legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
