Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the House of Representatives passing a bill related to abortion funding. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions. They had another proposal to ban late-term abortions, but it was withdrawn because moderate Republicans thought it was too extreme. The bill that passed was about barring federal funds, which had been approved in the last Congress. It passed with 242-179 votes, with three Democrats supporting it. Only one Republican, Richard Hanna, voted against it.

The White House promised to veto this legislation. The vote coincided with the March for Life event, which is the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. Initially, they wanted to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," which would ban abortions after 20 weeks. This bill was approved in 2013 but was pulled this time because some GOP members, especially women, opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports to get an abortion. They argued most rapes aren't reported, especially in cases of incest.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on this instead of job creation. Religious activists were unhappy with the decision to pull the bill. Centrist Republicans felt it sent a bad message, especially to women and young people, and that the party should focus more on economic issues. Speaker Boehner has had issues with conservatives before, and now with more GOP members, including 22 women, future legislation might be complicated. Some members like Renee Ellmers and Trent Franks are still pushing for the 20-week ban bill.

So, to summarize, the key points are:
- House passes bill banning federal abortion funding after another bill was withdrawn due to opposition.
- The withdrawn bill had a controversial provision about rape victims.
- Moderate Republicans and some Democrats supported the funding ban.
- Criticism from Pelosi and religious groups about the focus on abortion over other issues.
- The decision reflects internal GOP conflicts and potential future legislative challenges.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers these points clearly.

SUMMARY: The U.S. House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, passed a bill banning federal taxpayer funding for abortions, following the withdrawal of a more controversial measure targeting "late-term" abortions. The latter was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans, who deemed it too extreme. The approved bill, which passed 242-179 with three Democrats supporting it, had been approved in the last Congress. The White House vowed to veto it. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, marking the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. The withdrawn bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," aimed to ban abortions after 20 weeks but faced opposition over a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports. Moderate Republicans and some Democrats criticized the focus on abortion over job creation. The decision reflects internal GOP tensions and potential challenges for future legislation. END OF SUMMARY.
