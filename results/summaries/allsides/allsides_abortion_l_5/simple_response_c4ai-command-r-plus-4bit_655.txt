SUMMARY: The GOP-led House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but a bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill barring federal funds for abortions passed with a mostly party-line vote, despite a veto threat from the White House. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. Republican leaders initially planned to pass a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks, but a group of female GOP members opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to qualify for an exception. Some male members agreed, arguing that the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people. The decision to pull the bill was a win for centrist members and a setback for religious activists seeking more abortion restrictions. It also highlighted the growing influence of more moderate members, particularly women and those from competitive districts, who are willing to challenge their leaders. The bill's author, Rep. Trent Franks, expressed disappointment but said he was confident the bill would have passed.
END OF SUMMARY.
