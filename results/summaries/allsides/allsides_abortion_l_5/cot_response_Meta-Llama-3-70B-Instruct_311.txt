SUMMARY:
The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions, a move criticized by Democrats and the White House, which promised to veto the legislation. The bill's passage came as tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists marched on the National Mall to mark the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. The vote was preceded by a controversy over a separate bill banning "late-term" abortions, which was yanked due to opposition from moderate Republicans who deemed it too extreme. The bill's provision requiring women to file a police report to access an abortion in cases of rape sparked outrage, with critics arguing it would undermine women's health and autonomy. The episode highlighted divisions within the GOP, with centrist members pushing for a more nuanced approach to contentious social issues. END OF SUMMARY.
