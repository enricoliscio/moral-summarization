Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about the GOP-controlled House passing a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions. There was another bill targeting "late-term" abortions that was withdrawn because moderate Republicans found it too extreme. The bill that passed, barring federal funds, was approved with some Democratic support. The White House threatened a veto. The event coincided with the March for Life and the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.

Moderate Republicans opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports for abortion access. They argued it was too harsh. Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of jobs. Some religious groups were unhappy with the withdrawal, but centrists saw it as a good move for messaging ahead of the 2016 election.

The summary needs to capture the moral aspects, like the conflict between pro-life values and practical concerns, and the internal GOP tensions. I should mention the withdrawal of the stricter bill, the concerns about its impact, and the criticism from Pelosi and others. Also, note the broader implications for the party's messaging and future legislation.

I'll structure the summary to first state the main event, then the withdrawal of the stricter bill, reasons behind it, reactions, and the implications. Keeping it under 200 words and using the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning federal taxpayer funding for abortions, after a stricter proposal targeting "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill that passed, which prohibits federal funds for abortions, was approved 242-179, with three Democrats joining Republicans in support. The White House threatened a veto. The vote coincided with the annual March for Life and the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Moderate Republicans opposed a provision in the stricter bill requiring rape victims to file police reports for abortion access, arguing it was too harsh. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation. Some religious groups were unhappy with the withdrawal, but centrists saw it as a better message for the 2016 election. The internal GOP spat highlighted tensions between pro-life values and practical concerns, with some members urging a focus on broader economic issues. END OF SUMMARY.
