SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with 242 votes in favor and 179 against. However, a more restrictive bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled from the floor due to opposition from moderate Republicans, who argued it was too extreme. The pulled bill would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but included a provision requiring women to report rapes to the police in order to access an abortion. Female GOP members, led by Rep. Renee Ellmers, opposed this provision, citing that most rapes go unreported. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, which marks the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
