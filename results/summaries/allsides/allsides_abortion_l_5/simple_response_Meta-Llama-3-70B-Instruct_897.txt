SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but not before a more extreme proposal to ban "late-term" abortions was scrapped due to moderate Republican opposition. The rejected bill would have required women to provide evidence of a police report to access an abortion in cases of rape, sparking criticism from female GOP members who argued it was unrealistic and insensitive. The controversy highlights the moral dilemma of balancing anti-abortion rights with protecting women's health and autonomy. While religious activists and some Republicans lamented the decision to pull the bill, others saw it as a necessary compromise to avoid alienating women and young people ahead of the 2016 election. The episode reveals a growing divide within the GOP conference between those who prioritize symbolic votes on contentious social issues and those who seek to focus on broader economic messages.
