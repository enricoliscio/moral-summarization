SUMMARY: House Republicans voted to ban taxpayer funding of abortions, after another bill banning "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill passed 242-179, with the White House promising a veto. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life," marking the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which upheld women's access to abortion based on privacy rights. Initially, Republicans planned to pass the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," banning abortion procedures after 20 weeks. However, female GOP members led by Rep. Renee Ellmers opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access abortions. Some male members agreed, arguing that the party should focus less on contentious social issues and more on economic messages with broader appeal. The late-night decision to pull the bill was a win for centrists and a setback for anti-abortion rights activists. Despite the internal GOP disagreement, Speaker Boehner remains committed to fighting for anti-abortion rights legislation. 
END OF SUMMARY.
