SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with three Democrats joining Republicans in support. However, a more extreme bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled from the floor due to backlash from moderate Republicans, who argued it was too extreme. The pulled bill would have required women to provide evidence of a police report to access an abortion in cases of rape or incest. Many Republicans, including female members, opposed this provision, citing that most rapes go unreported. The decision to pull the bill was seen as a rare win for centrist members, who argued that the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, which drew tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists to the National Mall.

END OF SUMMARY.
