Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the US House of Representatives passing a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions. They initially wanted to pass a bill banning late-term abortions, but moderate Republicans opposed it because of a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports for an abortion. That bill was pulled, so they passed a different one that restricts federal funds. The vote was 242-179, with some Democrats supporting it. The White House promised a veto. There was a March for Life happening too. The article also mentions internal conflicts within the GOP and criticism from Pelosi about focusing on abortion instead of jobs. Some conservatives were upset about the bill being pulled, but centrists saw it as a good move for the party's image ahead of elections. The bill's author was disappointed but hopeful it would pass later.

I should make sure the summary includes the main points: the bill passed, the reason the first bill was pulled, the vote details, the White House's stance, the March for Life, internal GOP conflicts, Pelosi's criticism, and the implications for the party. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and in clear English without markdown.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled U.S. House passed a bill banning federal taxpayer funding for abortions after a more restrictive measure targeting "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill, which restricts federal funds for abortions, passed 242-179, with three Democrats supporting it. The White House threatened a veto. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life," marking the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was opposed by some Republicans for requiring rape victims to file police reports for abortions. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation. Moderate Republicans argued the bill sent a negative message, while conservatives were upset over its withdrawal. The bill's author expressed disappointment but remained hopeful for its eventual passage. END OF SUMMARY.
