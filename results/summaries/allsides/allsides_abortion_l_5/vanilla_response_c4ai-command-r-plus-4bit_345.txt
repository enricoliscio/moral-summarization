SUMMARY: The Republican-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, following the withdrawal of a bill banning "late-term" abortions due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining House Republicans in support. The White House vowed to veto the legislation. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life," marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. Initially, the House planned to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," but a group of female GOP members opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access abortions. Some male members agreed, and leaders ultimately withdrew the bill. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation. Religious activists pushing for abortion restrictions expressed disappointment with the decision to cancel the vote. The move represented a win for centrist members who argued that the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people. The willingness of centrist members to challenge their leaders could complicate future legislation. Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina faced criticism from anti-abortion rights groups for her role in opposing the bill.
END OF SUMMARY.
