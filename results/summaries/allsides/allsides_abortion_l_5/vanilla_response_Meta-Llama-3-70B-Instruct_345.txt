SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with 242 votes in favor and 179 against. The bill was a backup plan after a more restrictive measure, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans who deemed it too extreme. The pulled bill would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but included a controversial provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access an abortion. Female GOP members, led by Rep. Renee Ellmers, opposed this provision, arguing that many rapes go unreported. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, which marks the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
