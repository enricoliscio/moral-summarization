Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, the article talks about the GOP-controlled House passing a bill to ban taxpayer money for abortions. They initially tried a "late-term" abortion ban but pulled it due to moderate Republicans opposing it. The bill was seen as too extreme, especially because it required rape victims to file police reports for an abortion exception. That's a key moral point.

Moderate Republicans argued the bill sent a wrong message, especially to women and young people, which is another moral framing. The bill was pulled, which was a win for centrist members. The House then passed a different bill banning federal funds for abortions, but the White House promised to veto it. The vote coincided with the March for Life, marking the Roe v. Wade anniversary.

Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of jobs. Anti-abortion groups were unhappy with the leadership's decision. Some Republicans like Curbelo want to focus on broader economic issues rather than contentious social issues. The summary should include terms like GOP-controlled, banning, upheld, raped, prolife, undermines, wrong, symbolic, etc.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those moral words as possible without losing the essence of the article. I'll structure it to mention the initial bill, its withdrawal, the reasons, the passage of the second bill, reactions, and the broader implications.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions after a more extreme bill targeting "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," aimed to ban abortions after 20 weeks but included a controversial provision requiring rape victims to file police reports to access an abortion. Moderate GOP members, including Rep. Renee Ellmers, argued this provision sent the wrong message, especially given that most rapes go unreported and some involve incest. The bill's withdrawal was seen as a win for centrist members, who preferred focusing on broader economic issues rather than contentious social matters. The House then passed a bill barring federal taxpayer funds for abortions, which passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining Republicans. The White House vowed to veto the legislation. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for prioritizing abortion debates over job creation, calling the bill "worse" and "undermining" women's health. Anti-abortion activists were失望, while some Republicans, like Rep. Carlos Curbelo, emphasized the need to avoid symbolic votes and focus on legislation making a real difference. END OF SUMMARY.
