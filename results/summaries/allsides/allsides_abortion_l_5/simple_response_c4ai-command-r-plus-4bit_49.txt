SUMMARY: House Republicans passed legislation banning taxpayer money for abortions, but a more extreme bill banning so-called "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The approved bill passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining House Republicans in support. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life," an anti-abortion rally held on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. The more controversial bill, which would have banned abortion procedures after 20 weeks, was opposed by a bloc of female GOP members led by Rep. Renee Ellmers, who argued that the provision requiring women to file a police report in cases of rape was unreasonable and insensitive. Some male members agreed, and House leaders ultimately decided to withdraw the bill. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions expressed disappointment in the decision, while more centrist members argued that the bill sent the wrong message and distracted from broader economic issues. The willingness of centrist members to challenge their leaders on this issue may complicate future legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
