Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions. They initially tried a "late-term" abortion ban but withdrew it due to moderate Republican opposition. The bill they passed was about federal funds, which had been approved before. The White House threatened a veto. There was a March for Life event, and the article mentions the Roe v. Wade anniversary.

Moderate Republicans opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports for abortion access. They argued it was too extreme. Pelosi criticized the bill, saying it was worse and affected more women. Some GOP members, like Curbelo, preferred focusing on economic issues. The decision to pull the bill was a win for centrist members, and there was criticism of Ellmers for her role. The author used words like "banning," "pro-life," "rape," etc., which I need to include.

I'll structure the summary to include these points, making sure to use the moral terms. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the political and moral aspects as per the article.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning federal taxpayer funds for abortions, following the withdrawal of a more extreme "late-term" abortion ban due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill, which prohibits federal funding for abortions, passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining Republicans in support. The White House threatened a veto. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" and the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which upheld abortion rights. Moderate Republicans opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports for abortion access, arguing it was too extreme. GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo criticized the bill, stating he wouldn't judge a woman's account of rape. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi condemned the bill, calling it worse than the previously withdrawn measure and harmful to women's health and personal decisions. Some GOP members, including Rep. Charlie Dent, argued the party should focus on economic issues rather than contentious social matters. The decision to pull the "late-term" abortion bill was seen as a win for centrist members, who argued it sent the wrong message, especially to women and young people. Rep. Renee Ellmers, a key opponent, hinted at revisiting the bill, while Rep. Trent Franks expressed disappointment over its withdrawal. END OF SUMMARY.
