SUMMARY:
The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer-funded abortions, but only after a more "extreme" proposal to ban "late-term" abortions was pulled due to backlash from moderate Republicans. The pulled bill had a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access an abortion, which many deemed "wrong" and "undermining" to women's health. Even some pro-life Republicans opposed this provision, arguing it was "invalid" to question a woman's account of rape. The decision to pull the bill was a rare win for centrist members, who want the party to focus on economic issues rather than "contentious" social issues. The move was criticized by anti-abortion rights groups, who felt it sent the "wrong" message, especially on the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. END OF SUMMARY.
