Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the House of Representatives passing a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions. There was another bill about late-term abortions that was pulled because moderate Republicans thought it was too extreme. The bill that passed was about federal funds, and it got 242-179 votes, with some Democrats supporting it. The White House said they'd veto it. There was a March for Life happening, which is an annual event. The initial bill, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, was about banning abortions after 20 weeks. It had a provision about rape victims needing to file police reports, which some Republicans opposed. Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of jobs. Some religious groups were unhappy the bill was pulled. There's mention of internal conflict within the GOP, especially with female members. The bill that passed is about federal funds, and the other one was too extreme. The House is controlled by Republicans, and there are 22 female members. Some want to focus on economic issues instead. The bill author was disappointed but confident it would pass eventually.

Okay, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the bill passed, the other bill was pulled, reasons why, reactions from Pelosi, internal GOP conflict, and the context of the March for Life and Roe v. Wade anniversary.

Let me structure it: Start with the House passing the bill banning federal funds. Mention the other bill being pulled due to opposition. Highlight the moderate Republicans' concerns. Note the vote count and the White House's veto threat. Mention the March for Life and Roe v. Wade. Then talk about the initial bill's provisions and the opposition led by Renee Ellmers. Pelosi's criticism. The impact on the party's messaging and future legislation. End with the bill author's disappointment.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit. Let me check the word count as I draft.

The White House threatened a veto. The vote coincided with the annual March for Life, marking the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation.
