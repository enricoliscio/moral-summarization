SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but not before a more extreme proposal to ban "late-term" abortions was scrapped due to moderate Republican opposition. The scrapped bill would have required women to provide evidence of a police report in order to access an abortion in cases of rape, sparking criticism from female GOP members who argued that most rapes go unreported. The decision to pull the bill was seen as a rare win for centrist Republicans, who argued that the bill sent the wrong message to women and young people. The move was criticized by religious activists and anti-abortion rights groups, who saw it as a missed opportunity to restrict access to abortion. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle within the GOP to balance its anti-abortion stance with its desire to appeal to a broader audience. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill if it reaches the President's desk.

END OF SUMMARY.
