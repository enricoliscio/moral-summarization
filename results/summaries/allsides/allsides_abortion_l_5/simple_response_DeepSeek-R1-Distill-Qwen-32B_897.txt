Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the House passing a bill banning federal funds for abortions. They initially wanted to pass a more extreme bill banning abortions after 20 weeks, but moderate Republicans, especially some women, opposed it because it required rape victims to file police reports. This led to the bill being pulled, which was a rare win for centrists. The House ended up passing a less contentious bill, but there's internal conflict within the GOP, and some see this as bad messaging ahead of the 2016 election. Pelosi criticized them for not focusing on jobs instead.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key events, the moral arguments from both sides, and the implications for the party. I should keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me structure it: Start with the bill passed, mention the initial more extreme bill being pulled, the reasons why (rape provision), who opposed it, the outcome, the reaction from Pelosi, the internal conflict, and the impact on the party's messaging. Conclude with the ongoing debate and future possibilities.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the pro-life stance versus the concerns about privacy and women's rights. Also, note the political implications, like the party's focus shifting away from economic issues.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning federal taxpayer funding for abortions, after a more extreme proposal to restrict "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The original bill required rape victims to file police reports to access abortions, a provision opposed by some GOP members who argued it would deter many women from seeking help. The revised bill, which passed 242-179, bans federal abortion funding but faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans for its messaging and focus on contentious social issues. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for neglecting job creation and women's health. The decision to pull the stricter bill was seen as a rare win for centrist Republicans, who argued it sent a negative message to women and young people ahead of the 2016 election. Despite the outcome, anti-abortion activists expressed disappointment, and some GOP members vowed to revisit the issue. The internal conflict highlighted growing divisions within the party over prioritizing social versus economic issues. END OF SUMMARY.
