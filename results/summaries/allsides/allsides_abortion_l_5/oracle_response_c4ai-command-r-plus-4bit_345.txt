SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House voted to ban taxpayer funding for abortions, but a more extreme bill banning so-called "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans who felt it sent the wrong message. The bill would have required women who are victims of rape to file a police report in order to obtain an abortion. This provision was criticized for undermining women's health and privacy rights upheld in the Roe v. Wade decision. The vote came as tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists gathered for the annual "March for Life," but religious leaders expressed disappointment in the Republican leadership's decision to cancel the vote on the more restrictive bill. The bill's withdrawal represents a win for centrist members who wish to focus on less contentious issues and expand the party's support ahead of the 2016 election. However, anti-abortion groups criticized Rep. Renee Ellmers for her role in opposing the bill, and some questioned the GOP's commitment to fighting for anti-abortion rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
