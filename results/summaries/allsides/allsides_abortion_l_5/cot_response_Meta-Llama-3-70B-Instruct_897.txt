SUMMARY:
The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans in support. The vote came as tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists gathered for the annual "March for Life." However, a more extreme bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled from the floor due to moderate Republicans' concerns over a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report to access an abortion. Critics argued this provision was "extreme" and would affect millions of women. The decision was seen as a win for centrist members, who argued the bill sent the wrong message, especially to women and young people. The White House has promised to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. END OF SUMMARY.
