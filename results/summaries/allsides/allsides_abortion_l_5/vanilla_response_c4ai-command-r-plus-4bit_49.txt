SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, after a more controversial bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining most House Republicans in support. The White House has vowed to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event on the National Mall, marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," included a provision requiring women who are raped to file a police report in order to access abortion services, which was criticized by some GOP members as too extreme. The internal divide highlights a growing sentiment among centrist Republicans to focus on economic issues and broaden their appeal, rather than on divisive social issues. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions expressed disappointment with the leadership's decision to cancel the vote. The willingness of more centrist members to challenge their leaders may complicate future legislation on social issues.
END OF SUMMARY.
