SUMMARY:
The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans in support. However, a more extreme bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled due to backlash from moderate Republicans, who argued it was too extreme. The bill's provision requiring women to file a police report in order to access an abortion in cases of rape sparked controversy, with some members arguing it was wrong to question the validity of a woman's account of rape. The move was seen as a win for centrist members, who want the party to focus on broader economic messages rather than contentious social issues. The decision was criticized by religious activists, who argued it sent the wrong message, especially to women and young people. END OF SUMMARY.
