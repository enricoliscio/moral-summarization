SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning all taxpayer money for abortions, but not before a more extreme bill to ban "late-term" abortions was yanked due to backlash from moderate Republicans. The bill, which was approved 242-179, would undermine the health of millions of women and affect their personal decisions on how to spend their own money on health insurance. The decision to pull the more extreme bill was a rare win for centrist members, who argued it sent the wrong message, especially to women and young people. Pro-life activists were unhappy with the Republican leadership's decision, and some male members agreed that a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report was wrong. The vote coincided with the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld a woman's access to abortion based on privacy rights in the Constitution. The White House promised to veto the legislation if it reached the President's desk.

END OF SUMMARY.
