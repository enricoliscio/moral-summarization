Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. My task is to identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about the House passing a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions, after another bill was pulled due to opposition. There's a lot of moral language here, so I need to pick out the words that carry moral weight.

In STEP 1, I should list each morally framed word with a * before them. Words like "ban," "taxpayer," "abortions," "extreme," "pro-life," etc., come to mind. I need to make sure I capture all of these.

For the summary, I have to be concise, under 200 words. I should include the key points: the bill passed, the previous bill was pulled, reasons why (moderate Republicans, moral concerns), the reaction from different groups, and the political implications. I need to use the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and covers all the essential aspects without getting bogged down in too many details. It's important to highlight the internal conflict within the GOP and the broader implications for their agenda.

Let me start by listing the morally framed words. Then, I'll craft the summary, making sure to include those words where appropriate. I'll keep an eye on the word count to stay within the limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions after a more extreme "late-term" abortion ban was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill, which prohibits federal taxpayer money for abortions, passed 242-179, with three Democrats supporting it. Moderate Republicans criticized the original bill for requiring rape survivors to file police reports to access abortions, arguing it sent a harmful message. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi condemned the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, calling the bill "worse" than the one previously pulled. Anti-abortion activists were disappointed, while centrist Republicans argued the bill distracted from broader economic issues. The decision to pull the bill was seen as a win for more moderate members, though some conservatives expressed disappointment. The House will likely revisit the abortion ban in its best possible form. END OF SUMMARY.
