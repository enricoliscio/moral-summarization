SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but only after a more extreme proposal to ban "late-term" abortions was pulled due to moderate Republican opposition. The rejected bill would have required women to provide evidence of a police report to access an abortion in cases of rape, sparking criticism from female GOP members who argued that most rapes go unreported. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill. The controversy highlights the GOP's internal divisions on abortion, with some members prioritizing economic issues over social ones. The episode also underscores the influence of religious activists pushing for stricter abortion laws. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, arguing that the bill undermines women's health and personal autonomy.

END OF SUMMARY.
