SUMMARY: On Thursday, the GOP-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions. This came after another proposal to ban "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans who deemed it too extreme. The bill barring federal funds for abortions passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining House Republicans in support. The White House has vowed to veto the legislation. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life," marking the anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld a woman's access to abortion. Earlier plans to pass the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," banning abortions after 20 weeks, were scrapped due to opposition from female GOP members who argued that the bill's exception for rape victims, requiring a police report, was impractical and insensitive. House Democrats criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation, saying the bill undermines women's health and personal decisions. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions expressed disappointment in the Republican leadership's decision to cancel the vote. The bill's withdrawal was a win for centrist members who felt it sent the wrong message and distracted from broader economic issues. The growing sentiment within the GOP is to focus on legislation that makes a difference and avoids symbolic votes.
