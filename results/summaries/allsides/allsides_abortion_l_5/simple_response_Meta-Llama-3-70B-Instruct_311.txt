SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but only after a more restrictive bill banning "late-term" abortions was pulled due to moderate Republican opposition. The pulled bill would have required women to provide evidence of a police report to access an abortion in cases of rape, sparking criticism from female GOP members who argued it would unfairly burden victims of rape and incest. The approved bill, which passed 242-179, has been met with a White House veto threat. The controversy highlights the GOP's internal divisions on abortion, with some members pushing for stricter restrictions and others advocating for a more nuanced approach. The debate has also drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue that the focus on abortion distracts from more pressing economic issues. The episode has sparked a wider conversation about the GOP's messaging and priorities ahead of the 2016 election.

END OF SUMMARY.
