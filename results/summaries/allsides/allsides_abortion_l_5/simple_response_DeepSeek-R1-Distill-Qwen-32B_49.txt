Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about the GOP-controlled House passing a bill banning taxpayer-funded abortions. Initially, they wanted to pass a more restrictive bill targeting "late-term" abortions, but it was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans, especially women in the party. These moderates opposed a provision requiring rape victims to file police reports to get an abortion, arguing it's unrealistic since many rapes go unreported. The bill that passed instead was a less controversial one about federal funds, which had been approved before.

There's also mention of the March for Life event coinciding with the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, highlighting the pro-life movement's presence. The article discusses internal conflicts within the GOP, with some members criticizing the focus on abortion over economic issues. Pelosi and other Democrats criticized the bill, arguing it's harmful and distracts from job creation. Some religious groups were unhappy with the withdrawal, while others like Dent and Curbelo believe the party should focus on more unifying issues.

I need to capture the moral aspects: the conflict between pro-life and moderate Republicans, the opposition to the police report requirement, the focus on abortion over economic issues, and the internal party dynamics affecting legislation.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and ends with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning federal taxpayer funds for abortions after a more restrictive "late-term" abortion bill was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans, particularly women in the party. The rejected bill required rape victims to file police reports for abortion access, a provision criticized as unrealistic. The approved bill, which passed 242-179, had been previously approved and focuses on federal funds. The vote coincided with the annual March for Life, marking the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Moderate Republicans argued the original bill sent a harmful message, especially to women and young people, and distracted from economic priorities. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion over job creation. Some religious groups were unhappy with the withdrawal, while others, like Rep. Charlie Dent, advocated for less contentious issues. The internal conflict highlights the GOP's struggle to balance pro-life priorities with broader appeal ahead of the 2016 election. END OF SUMMARY.
