SUMMARY: The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted to ban the use of taxpayer money for abortions, but only after a more extreme bill banning so-called "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The bill that passed would bar federal funds from being used for abortions, and it received support from most House Republicans as well as three Democrats. The initial bill, which would have banned abortion procedures after 20 weeks of pregnancy, was opposed by a group of female GOP members who argued that it was too restrictive and sent the wrong message to women and young people. The debate over these bills took place as tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists gathered for the annual "March for Life" in Washington, D.C., marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. The internal disagreement among Republicans highlights a growing divide within the party between more centrist members who want to focus on economic issues and social conservatives who want to prioritize contentious social issues. This divide may complicate future legislation as more moderate members are willing to challenge their leaders.
END OF SUMMARY.
