Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions after another bill targeting "late-term" abortions was withdrawn. Moderate Republicans opposed the stricter bill because it required rape victims to file police reports. The White House threatened a veto, and there was internal conflict within the GOP. Pelosi criticized them for not focusing on jobs. Activists were unhappy, and the decision to pull the bill was a win for centrist members. The bill passed 242-179 with some Democrats supporting it. Rep. Ellmers wants to bring the 20-week ban back.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the moral words provided. I'll structure it to highlight the conflict, the reasons for the bill's withdrawal, and the implications. I'll make sure to include words like "banning," "raped," "pro-life," "undermines," "wrong," etc.

I should start with the main action: the House passing the taxpayer abortion ban. Then explain why the other bill was withdrawn, focusing on the rape provision and moderate opposition. Mention the White House's veto threat and Pelosi's criticism. Note the activists' disappointment and the internal party dynamics. Conclude with the bill's passage and Rep. Ellmers' intentions.

I'll ensure the summary flows logically, keeping each sentence concise. I'll check word count to stay under 200 words and make sure all key points are covered with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, following the withdrawal of a stricter bill targeting "late-term" abortions due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was criticized for requiring rape victims to file police reports to access abortions, with some arguing this undermines women's rights. The White House threatened a veto, and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP for focusing on abortion instead of job creation. Anti-abortion activists were失望, while centrist Republicans argued the bill sent the wrong message. The final bill, barring federal funds for abortions, passed 242-179, with three Democrats supporting it. GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers hinted at revisiting the 20-week abortion ban. END OF SUMMARY.
