SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but a bill banning so-called "late-term" abortions was pulled due to opposition from moderate Republicans who deemed it extreme. The bill barring federal taxpayer funds for abortions was approved, with three Democrats joining House Republicans in support. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event and the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld a woman's access to abortion based on privacy rights. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions were unhappy with the decision to cancel the vote on the latter bill, arguing that it sent the wrong message on contentious social issues, especially to women and young people. The bill's withdrawal was a rare win for centrist members who wanted to expand the party's support ahead of the national election. Since gaining control of the House, Speaker John Boehner has faced opposition from conservatives on various bills, and the growing number of female members is challenging leadership on controversial legislation. Anti-abortion rights activists were upset that the bill was pulled, but the GOP leadership remains committed to fighting for anti-abortion rights measures. END OF SUMMARY.
