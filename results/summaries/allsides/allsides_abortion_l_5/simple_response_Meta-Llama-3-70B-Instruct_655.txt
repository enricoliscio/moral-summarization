SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, but only after a more restrictive bill was pulled due to moderate Republican opposition. The rejected bill would have banned abortions after 20 weeks, but included a provision requiring women to report rapes to the police in order to access an abortion. Many Republicans, including women, felt this provision was too extreme. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill. The debate coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, marking the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. Democrats and some Republicans criticized the focus on abortion, arguing it distracts from more pressing economic issues. The internal GOP spat highlights the party's struggle to balance its anti-abortion stance with concerns about women's rights and the party's broader appeal.
