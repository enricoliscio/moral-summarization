SUMMARY:

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill banning taxpayer funding for abortions, with 242 votes in favor and 179 against. The bill was a backup plan after a more restrictive measure, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was pulled from the floor due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The pulled bill would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but included a provision requiring women to report rapes to the police to access an abortion, which was deemed too extreme. The White House has promised to veto the passed bill if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, marking the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. The internal GOP spat has been criticized by Democrats, who argue that the party is focusing on divisive social issues instead of job creation.
