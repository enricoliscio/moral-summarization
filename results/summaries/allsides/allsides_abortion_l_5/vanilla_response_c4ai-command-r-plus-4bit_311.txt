SUMMARY: The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation banning taxpayer funding for abortions, following the withdrawal of a more controversial bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining House Republicans in support. The White House has vowed to veto the legislation if it reaches the President's desk. The vote coincided with the annual "March for Life" event, marking the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which upheld women's access to abortion. The initial bill was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans who argued that it was too extreme, particularly a provision requiring rape victims to file a police report in order to access an abortion. Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions expressed disappointment with the Republican leadership's decision to cancel the vote. The late-night decision was a win for more centrist members who argued that the bill sent the wrong message and distracted from broader economic issues. The willingness of members representing competitive districts to challenge their leaders may complicate future legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
