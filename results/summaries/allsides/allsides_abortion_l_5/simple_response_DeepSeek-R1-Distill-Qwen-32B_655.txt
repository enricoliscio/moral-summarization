Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the GOP-controlled House passing a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions. They had another bill about "late-term" abortions that was pulled because moderate Republicans thought it was too extreme. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," was supposed to ban abortions after 20 weeks. However, some Republican members, especially women, opposed a part that required rape victims to file a police report for an abortion exception. They argued that most rapes aren't reported, especially cases of incest.

Moderate Republicans, like Rep. Renee Ellmers, led the opposition, saying the provision was unfair. This caused internal conflict within the GOP. The bill was pulled, and a different one banning federal funds for abortions passed instead. The White House promised to veto it. The article also mentions the March for Life and the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.

There's criticism from both sides: Pelosi criticized the GOP for not focusing on job creation and for the bill's impact on women's health. Some Republicans, like Rep. Curbelo, think the party should focus on economic issues instead of contentious social ones. The leadership's decision to pull the bill was seen as a win for centrist members, but religious activists were unhappy.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, highlighting the moral aspects like the opposition to the rape provision, the internal GOP conflict, and the broader implications of the legislation on women's rights and party strategy.

I should structure the summary to include the key events: the initial bill's failure, the reason (rape provision), the resulting vote on the taxpayer bill, the criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, and the implications for the party's messaging and future legislation.

Make sure to keep it under 200 words and preserve the moral framing, such as the concern for women's rights and the party's strategy for the upcoming election.

SUMMARY: The GOP-controlled House passed a bill banning federal taxpayer funds for abortions after another proposal to restrict "late-term" abortions was withdrawn due to opposition from moderate Republicans. The initial bill, the "Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," aimed to ban abortions after 20 weeks but included a controversial provision requiring rape victims to file police reports for abortion access. Moderate Republicans, including Rep. Renee Ellmers, opposed this, arguing it unfairly targeted women. The bill's withdrawal, seen as a win for centrist members, led to the passage of a less contentious measure banning federal abortion funding, which passed 242-179. The White House vowed to veto it. Critics, including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, argued the focus on abortion distracted from job creation and women's health. Some Republicans, like Rep. Carlos Curbelo, echoed this, advocating for a focus on economic issues. The decision drew criticism from anti-abortion activists, who saw it as a setback for their cause. END OF SUMMARY.
