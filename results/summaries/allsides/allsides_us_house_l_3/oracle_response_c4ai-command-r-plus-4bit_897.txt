SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel and her use of language that can be interpreted as anti-Semitic tropes has taken a new turn, with Democratic leadership scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears without directly referring to her. While there are more important issues for the Democratic Party to address, the defense of Omar by some on the left and the 'what aboutism' responses are also problematic. Changing US policy on Israel and challenging the Democratic Party's commitment to Israeli policies will be an uphill battle if those involved are not careful with their language. It is important to be deliberate in word choice, even when facing attacks and racism from others, because it is the right thing to do. The controversy over Omar's comments comes at a time when the two-party consensus on US foreign policy in Israel is breaking down, with younger Democrats viewing the reflexive support for Israel as a problem. While Omar's critics have called her comments unacceptable and hurtful, the decision to bring this issue to the House floor is preposterous and risks alienating important Democratic voting blocs. Leaders should focus on addressing more pressing issues and rejecting attempts to criminalize boycotts of Israel, while also ensuring that Omar avoids anti-Semitic tropes in the future.
