SUMMARY: 
An ugly controversy has emerged surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel, which have been deemed anti-Semitic. While Omar's defenders argue that her criticism of US-Israel policy would have been smeared regardless, her remarks have caused an unprecedented controversy within the Democratic Party. This incident highlights a problematic trend of whataboutism, deflecting attention from the Israeli government's illegal occupation of Palestinian land and its determination to keep Palestinians in a legal and humanitarian limbo. 

The controversy is particularly unfortunate given the changing landscape of American foreign policy towards Israel. There is a growing gap in favorability for Israel between Democrats and Republicans, with younger Democrats viewing US support for Israel as a problem. However, the Democratic leadership's decision to bring this issue to the floor of the House is preposterous and creates a needless split in the party. While Omar's comments were unacceptable and hurtful to many American Jews, they do not warrant public censure, especially when compared to the more problematic actions of other actors like Steve King or Duncan Hunter. 

The matter should be dealt with internally, and Democratic leaders should focus on rejecting attempts to criminalize boycotts of Israel and listen to activists calling for a change in the party's unjust stance on the issue. Pretending that Omar's comments were innocent does no favors for anyone, especially not the Palestinians who continue to suffer under Israeli occupation. 

END OF SUMMARY.
