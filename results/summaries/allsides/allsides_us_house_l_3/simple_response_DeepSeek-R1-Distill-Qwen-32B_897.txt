Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments about Israel. The author is discussing the moral implications of her remarks and the reactions from both Democrats and the Republican side.

First, I should identify the main points. The article talks about how Omar's comments were perceived as anti-Semitic, leading to a floor vote by Democrats to condemn dual-loyalty smears. The author criticizes this move, arguing it's not the best use of time, especially when other issues like the president's business dealings are more pressing. There's also a discussion about the broader context of American policy towards Israel and the changing attitudes among younger Democrats.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral aspects, like the importance of being careful with language to avoid anti-Semitic tropes, the criticism of the Democrats' handling of the issue, and the broader implications for US-Israel policy. I should also touch on the support for Omar despite the backlash and the argument that the party should address more pressing issues instead of this controversy.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral framing the author presented. I'll start by mentioning Omar's comments, the reaction from Democrats, the criticism of their approach, and the broader implications for policy and party dynamics. I'll also include the point about the right thing to do in terms of avoiding anti-Semitism and the potential consequences for Palestinians.

Let me structure it: Start with Omar's comments and the reaction, then the author's criticism of the Democrats' handling, followed by the broader context of changing policies and the moral obligation to avoid anti-Semitic language. Conclude with the impact on the party and the need to address more critical issues.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in specific examples but ensure the moral dimensions are clear. Make sure it's balanced, showing both the criticism of Omar's handling and the broader issues at play.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all the key moral points.
