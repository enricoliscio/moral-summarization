SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments on Israel has sparked a heated debate, with some accusing her of perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes. While Omar's defenders argue that her criticism of America's Israel policy was destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic, others believe that her language was hurtful and problematic. The Democratic Party's decision to condemn dual-loyalty smears without referring to Omar by name has been criticized as a misguided attempt to deflect attention from the Israeli government's occupation and oppression of Palestinians. The author argues that changing the debate about Israel in the US requires careful language and a commitment to justice for the oppressed Palestinians. Uncritical defenders of Israeli policy often use "what aboutism" to deflect attention from crimes committed against Palestinians, and the Democratic Party's ossified senior leadership must be shaken out of its unthinking commitment to right-wing Israeli governments. The controversy has exposed a growing divide within the Democratic Party on Israel policy, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of unconditional US support for Israel.
