SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments on Israel has sparked a heated debate. Omar's remarks about "allegiance to a foreign country" were criticized for playing into anti-Semitic tropes. Instead of addressing the issue quietly, Democratic leadership has scheduled a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, without referring to Omar by name. The article argues that while Omar's defenders are correct that her criticism of US-Israel policy was destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic, it's still important to be deliberate about word choice to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The controversy highlights the changing landscape of US policy on Israel, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of the country's actions. The article concludes that Democrats should focus on addressing the issue internally and avoid alienating Jewish voters, while also rejecting attempts to criminalize boycotts of Israel.
