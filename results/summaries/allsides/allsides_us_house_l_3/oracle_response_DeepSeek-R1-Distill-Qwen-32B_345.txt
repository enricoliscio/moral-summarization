Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments on Israel. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about Omar's remarks on political influence and allegiance, which some saw as anti-Semitic. The Democratic leadership's response is to schedule a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears. The article also discusses the broader context of U.S. policy towards Israel and the changing attitudes among younger Democrats.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like influence, allegiance, condemn, support, justice, oppressed, attacks, censure, etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects, such as the right thing to do, the importance of word choice, and the broader implications for U.S. policy.

I'll start by mentioning Omar's comments and the accusations of anti-Semitism. Then, I'll note the Democratic leadership's unprecedented step to schedule a vote. I should include the criticism that this action splits the party and could alienate Jewish voters. It's important to mention the broader context of U.S. support for Israel and the changing attitudes among younger Democrats.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll make sure to include the key moral points: the need for careful language to avoid anti-Semitism, the importance of justice for Palestinians, and the criticism of the Democratic leadership's handling of the issue.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the morally framed words and maintain the author's perspective on the issue.

SUMMARY: The controversy over freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) and her comments on Israel highlights the moral complexities of political influence and allegiance. Omar's remarks about "political influence" and "pledge support to a foreign country" were seen as playing into anti-Semitic tropes about dual loyalty. Democratic leadership, instead of addressing the issue privately, scheduled a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, a move criticized as opening a needless split in the party. The article argues that while Omar's defenders claim her comments were innocent, the broader context of U.S. support for Israel and the need for justice for Palestinians must be addressed. The moral framing emphasizes the importance of avoiding language that can be read as anti-Semitic, even if it means challenging the ossified senior leadership's commitment to Israel. The article also critiques the use of "what aboutism" to deflect attention from Israel's occupation and crimes against Palestinians. While Omar's supporters are inspired by her criticism of U.S. policy, the article warns that Democrats cannot afford to alienate Jewish voters or pretend her comments were innocent. The kerfuffle underscores the need for careful word choice and a focus on the right thing to do, even in the face of anti-Semitic insinuations and attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
