SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has sparked a heated debate. Omar's remarks about allegiance to a foreign country were criticized for playing into anti-Semitic tropes. Instead of meeting with Omar, Democratic leadership scheduled a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears. The article argues that while Omar's defenders are correct that her criticism of US-Israel policy was destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic, it's still important to be deliberate about word choice to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The controversy is taking place at a time when the two-party consensus on US foreign policy in Israel is breaking down, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of US support for Israel. The article concludes that Democrats should focus on addressing the problematic actors within their own party rather than targeting Omar, and that they should listen to activists who reject the party's stance on the issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
