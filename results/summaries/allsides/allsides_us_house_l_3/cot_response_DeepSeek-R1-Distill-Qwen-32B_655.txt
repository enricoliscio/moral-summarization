Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a step-by-step process where I first identify all the morally framed words, then write a summary using those words. Let me start by understanding the article.

The article talks about Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments regarding Israel and the political backlash. It discusses how her remarks were perceived as anti-Semitic, the Democratic response, and the broader implications for US-Israel policy. There's a lot of moral language here, so I need to pick out those words first.

Looking through the article, words like "anti-Semitic," "outrage," "smears," "nightmarish," "unjust," "outrageous," "discrimination," "boycotts," "oppression," "injustices," "racist," "hate," "slander," "prejudice," and "exclusion" stand out as morally charged. These words convey strong judgments about the actions and policies discussed.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these moral terms. The main points are Omar's comments, the Democratic reaction, the broader policy debate, and the impact on Palestinian rights. I should highlight the moral issues like anti-Semitism, the handling of her remarks, and the implications for policy and justice.

I should ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes the key morally framed words. I'll structure it to cover Omar's statements, the political response, the debate over US-Israel policy, and the moral implications for both Democrats and Palestinians.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

**Summary:**
The article discusses the controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel, which were perceived as anti-Semitic. Her remarks about allegiance to a foreign country and subsequent tweet were seen as playing into anti-Semitic tropes, sparking outrage and a floor vote by Democratic leaders to condemn dual-loyalty smears. The article critiques the Democratic response, arguing that focusing on Omar's comments distracts from more pressing issues like Steve King's and Duncan Hunter's problematic actions. It highlights the moral obligation to avoid anti-Semitic language, even while advocating for Palestinian justice. The piece also addresses the broader debate over U.S. policy in Israel, noting a growing divide among Democrats, particularly younger members, who increasingly question unwavering support for Israel. The article emphasizes the importance of deliberate language to avoid reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes, while also critiquing the Republican Party's embrace of Islamophobia and the Israeli government's occupation of the West Bank. It concludes that while Omar's comments were problematic, the Democratic Party's handling of the issue risks alienating Jewish allies and undermining efforts to address Palestinian oppression. END OF SUMMARY.
