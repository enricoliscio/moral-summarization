Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article is about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments on Israel. She made a remark about not wanting to pledge allegiance to a foreign country, which some interpreted as anti-Semitic. The Democratic leadership is reacting by scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, but not naming her. The author seems critical of this approach, suggesting it's not the best use of time when there are more pressing issues like investigating the president.

The author also points out that while supporting Omar is important, her language has been problematic and risks reinforcing anti-Semitic tropes. They argue that challenging Israel's policies is already difficult, and any missteps can be used against the cause. The article mentions the broader context of the breakdown in the two-party consensus on U.S. foreign policy towards Israel, especially among younger Democrats.

I need to capture the moral aspects: the importance of being careful with language to avoid anti-Semitism, the need to support Palestinian justice, and the criticism of the Democratic leadership's handling of the situation. Also, the author's stance that Omar's comments, while intended to be critical of Israel's policy, can be misread and should be handled with care.

I should structure the summary to include the controversy, the reaction from Democrats, the moral implications of language, the broader policy shift, and the criticism of the leadership's approach. Keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear.

The article discusses the controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about allegiance to a foreign country, which were interpreted as anti-Semitic. The Democratic leadership's decision to schedule a floor vote condemning dual-loyalty smears, without naming Omar, is criticized as a misstep, especially given the need to focus on more pressing issues like investigating the president. The author highlights the moral imperative to avoid language that could be seen as anti-Semitic, emphasizing the difficulty of challenging U.S. policy toward Israel without reinforcing harmful tropes. The piece also notes the breakdown of the two-party consensus on Israel policy, particularly among younger Democrats, and the growing support for Palestinian justice. While the author supports Omar's right to criticize Israel's policies, they argue that her remarks risk alienating Jewish allies and undermine efforts to address Palestinian oppression. The article concludes that Democratic leadership's handling of the issue is flawed, and that their focus should instead be on more pressing matters, like confronting figures like Steve King or Duncan Hunter, rather than creating internal divisions over Omar's comments. END OF SUMMARY.
