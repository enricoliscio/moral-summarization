SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel and her use of language that can be interpreted as anti-Semitic has taken a new turn, with Democratic leadership scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears. While there are more important issues for the Democratic Party to address, the controversy is highlighting the breakdown of the two-party consensus on American foreign policy in Israel. Younger Democrats, in particular, are increasingly critical of the U.S.'s reflexive support for Israel and are starting to vote accordingly. The controversy over Omar's comments is happening at a time when the long-standing consensus on U.S. foreign policy in Israel is breaking down, and Democratic leaders' response to Omar's comments is creating an unnecessary split in the party. While Omar's defenders argue that her criticism of U.S. policy in Israel was bound to be smeared as anti-Semitic regardless of her words, it is important for her and other critics of Israeli policy to be deliberate in their word choice to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
END OF SUMMARY.
