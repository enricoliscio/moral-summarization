SUMMARY: Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar has sparked controversy over comments about Israel, including a remark about "allegiance to a foreign country" and a tweet about not pledging support to a foreign country. Democratic leadership has responded by scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears without naming her directly. While there are more important issues for the Democratic Party to focus on, the defense of Omar's comments and the comparison to other controversial figures is problematic. Changing the debate about Israel in the US and challenging the Democratic Party's commitment to right-wing Israeli governments will be difficult if those involved are not careful with their language. It's important to be deliberate, even in the face of attacks and racist fear campaigns from other members of Congress. The controversy over Omar's comments comes as the long-standing two-party consensus on US foreign policy in Israel is breaking down, with younger Democrats viewing reflexive support for Israel as a problem. While Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first two Muslim women in Congress, have faced smears and coordinated campaigns of hate and lies, Democrats must also listen to Jewish allies who find Omar's words hurtful and alienating. The decision to bring the issue to the House floor is unnecessary and opens up a split in the Democratic Party. Leaders should instead focus on rejecting attempts to criminalize boycotts of Israel and listening to activists calling for a change in stance on the issue.
