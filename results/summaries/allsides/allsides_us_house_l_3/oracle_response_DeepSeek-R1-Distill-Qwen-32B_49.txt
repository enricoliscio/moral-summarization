Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments on Israel. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

First, the article talks about Omar's remarks on political influence and allegiance, which led to accusations of anti-Semitism. The Democratic leadership is taking a step to condemn dual-loyalty smears, which is a moral stance. I should include words like 'condemn,' 'influence,' and 'allegiance.'

The article also discusses the broader context, like the Democratic Party's support for Israel and the tension with progressive members. Words like 'justice,' 'oppressed,' and 'crimes' are important here. I need to highlight the moral dilemma between supporting Omar and alienating Jewish allies.

I should also mention the opposition's use of 'what about' tactics to deflect attention from Israeli policies, using terms like 'deflect' and 'crimes.' The summary needs to show the complexity of the issue, balancing support for Omar's criticism without falling into anti-Semitic tropes.

Lastly, the article points out the breaking consensus on U.S. Israel policy, especially among younger Democrats. Including words like 'breaking down' and 'allyship' will convey the shift in public opinion.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral nuances without getting too detailed. Let me structure it by first introducing the controversy, then the Democratic response, followed by the broader implications, and conclude with the importance of careful language and allyship.

SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) and her comments about Israel highlights a moral and political dilemma. Omar's remarks about "political influence" and "allegiance to a foreign country" were interpreted as anti-Semitic, sparking a debate over dual loyalty and support for Israel. Democratic leadership has taken the unprecedented step of scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, though not naming Omar. Critics argue this move is unnecessary, especially as the party focuses on investigating the president's history. However, Omar's comments risk reinforcing anti-Semitic tropes, even if unintended. The article emphasizes the importance of deliberate language to avoid anti-Semitism, while also addressing the broader issue of U.S. support for Israel and its impact on Palestinians. The breaking down of the two-party consensus on Israel policy, driven by younger Democrats, highlights the tension between criticizing Israeli actions and avoiding anti-Semitic accusations. Omar's defenders argue her criticism of U.S.-Israel policy is often smeared as anti-Semitic, but the article warns that Democrats must balance supporting her while not alienating Jewish allies. The moral framing underscores the need for careful language and allyship, even as the debate over Israel's occupation and policies continues. END OF SUMMARY.
