Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments on Israel. They also included a previous response, which I should use as a reference.

First, the user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words. I remember that in the previous response, they listed words like "ugly," "anti-Semitic," "outrage," etc. I should go through the article again and pick out words that carry moral judgment or evaluation.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and preserve the moral tone the author intended.

I should start by understanding the main points of the article. It's about the controversy over Rep. Omar's comments, the reaction from Democratic leadership, the broader context of support for Israel, and the impact on the Democratic Party's stance. The moral framing here includes criticism of anti-Semitism, the handling of the issue by leadership, and the implications for policy and public opinion.

I'll need to make sure the summary captures the key moral aspects without getting bogged down in details. I'll focus on the conflict, the reactions, and the implications for the party and policy.

Let me structure the summary to include the main events and the moral evaluations. I'll mention the controversy, the Democratic response, the accusations of anti-Semitism, the support from the left, the challenges in changing the policy narrative, and the importance of language and alliances.

I should also highlight the broader context, like the changing public opinion and the impact on the Democratic base, especially younger members. This ties into the moral imperative of addressing anti-Semitism and the right thing to do.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, connecting the events and the moral implications without exceeding the word limit. I'll double-check to include as many morally framed words as possible from the first step to meet the user's requirements.

**SUMMARY:**

The controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments on Israel highlights the moral and political complexities of addressing U.S. foreign policy in Israel. Omar's remarks about "allegiance to a foreign country" were interpreted as anti-Semitic, sparking outrage and leading Democratic leaders to schedule a floor vote condemning dual-loyalty smears. While some defend Omar, accusing critics of "what aboutism" and ignoring broader issues like Steve King's racism or Republican Islamophobia, others argue that her language risks reinforcing anti-Semitic tropes. The debate reflects a broader breakdown in the two-party consensus on Israel, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of U.S. support for Israeli policies. Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, as vocal critics, have become targets of hate, but their supporters argue they are unfairly smeared. Democrats must balance addressing anti-Semitism with avoiding alienating Jewish allies, while also challenging the party's outdated stance on Israel. The decision to bring the issue to the floor is seen as counterproductive, as it divides the party and distracts from more pressing concerns like investigating the president. The moral imperative to avoid anti-Semitic language and uphold justice for Palestinians remains central to the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
