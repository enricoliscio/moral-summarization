SUMMARY:
The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has sparked a heated debate. While some defend her remarks as criticism of American policy, others see them as perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes. The Democratic Party's decision to condemn dual-loyalty smears without naming Omar has been met with criticism, as it may be seen as circling the wagons around her. The author argues that if one supports a revision of American policy in Israel and justice for Palestinians, they cannot have the country's most prominent critic of America's Israel policy repeatedly tripping over language that can be read as anti-Semitic. The controversy is problematic, especially as it distracts from more pressing issues, such as the president's business and political history. The author concludes that Democrats should be careful with their language and avoid whataboutism, as it is the right thing to do. END OF SUMMARY.
