Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments about Israel. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about how Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about allegiance to a foreign country sparked a new controversy. She tweeted that she shouldn't have to pledge support to a foreign country, which some saw as playing into anti-Semitic tropes about dual loyalty. The Democratic leadership decided to schedule a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, but not mentioning her by name. The author thinks this is a bad use of their time, especially since they should be focusing on investigating the president's history.

The article then discusses the broader issue of how the left is circling the wagons around Omar, using "what about" arguments to deflect from her comments. It mentions other problematic figures like Steve King and the president's comments at a rally. The author argues that supporting a revision of American policy in Israel is difficult because Omar's language can be seen as anti-Semitic, even if she wasn't directly charging anyone with dual loyalty.

The piece also touches on the importance of careful word choice, especially when dealing with sensitive topics. It contrasts this with the fact that some Republicans have faced little censure despite their own problematic statements and actions, like Duncan Hunter's racist campaign.

The article then shifts to the larger context of the breakdown in the two-party consensus on U.S. foreign policy in Israel. Younger Democrats are less likely to support Israel, and Omar and Rashida Tlaib are leading critics. The author mentions that while some progressive Jews support Omar, many are hurt by her comments, and Democrats shouldn't alienate this voting bloc.

Finally, the article criticizes the Democratic leadership for bringing the issue to the floor, suggesting they should focus on more problematic figures instead. It concludes that Omar's comments were not innocent and that the Democrats aren't helping Palestinians by pretending her remarks were harmless.

So, the main points are: Omar's comments, the Democratic response, the broader debate on Israel policy, the impact on the party and Jewish voters, and the criticism of the floor vote decision.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on these key points without getting too bogged down in the details. I should make sure to mention the controversy, the Democratic reaction, the implications for party unity and Jewish support, and the criticism of their handling of the issue.
