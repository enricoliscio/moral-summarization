SUMMARY: The ugly controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has taken an unfortunate turn, with Democratic leadership taking the unprecedented step of scheduling a floor vote to condemn her remarks without referring to her by name. While there are more important issues to focus on, the problem is that Omar, as the country's most prominent elected critic of US policy in Israel, must be careful not to use language that can be interpreted as anti-Semitic. This is important, even in the face of nightmarish attacks and outrageous behavior from others, because it is the right thing to do. Ironically, defenders of Israeli policy often deflect criticism by pointing to other global issues, which is a bad faith effort to redirect attention from Israel's illegal occupation and transgressions. While Omar's defenders are correct that her criticism was destined to be smeared, her comments were hurtful to many American Jews, and Democratic leaders should not pretend they were innocent. By calling her out publicly, they risk a needless split in the party and would be better off directing their censure at more problematic actors. END OF SUMMARY.
