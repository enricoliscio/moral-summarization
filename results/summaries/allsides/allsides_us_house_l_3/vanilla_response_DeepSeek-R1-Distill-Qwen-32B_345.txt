Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments about Israel. She made a remark about allegiance to a foreign country, which some saw as anti-Semitic. The Democratic leadership is reacting by scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, though not naming her. 

The article discusses the broader context, like the shift in Democratic support for Israel, especially among younger members. It mentions how Omar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women in Congress and are criticizing U.S. policy towards Israel. There's also a mention of how some Democrats are criticizing her, and the tension between supporting Palestinian justice and avoiding anti-Semitic tropes. 

I need to capture the main points: Omar's comments, the Democratic response, the debate over Israel policy, the generational shift in support, and the broader implications for U.S. foreign policy. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and covers all key aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments on allegiance to a foreign country has reignited debates about anti-Semitism and U.S. policy toward Israel. Omar's remarks were interpreted as playing into anti-Semitic tropes, prompting Democratic leadership to schedule a floor vote condemning dual-loyalty smears, though not naming her. The article highlights the tension between supporting Palestinian justice and avoiding language that could be seen as anti-Semitic. It also notes a generational shift in Democratic support for Israel, with younger members increasingly critical of U.S. policy. Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim women in Congress, have become prominent critics of U.S. Israel policy, facing backlash from the right. While some defend Omar, others argue her comments hurt Jewish allies. The article criticizes the Democratic leadership's decision to bring the issue to the floor, suggesting it could alienate Jewish voters and distract from more pressing issues. The debate reflects a broader breakdown in the two-party consensus on U.S. foreign policy toward Israel. END OF SUMMARY.
