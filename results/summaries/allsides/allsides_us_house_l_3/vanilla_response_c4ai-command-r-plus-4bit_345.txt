SUMMARY: Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel have sparked controversy, with some interpreting her remarks as anti-Semitic. Democratic leadership has responded by scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears without naming her directly. While there are more important issues for the Democratic Party to address, the controversy surrounding Omar's comments is significant as it coincides with a shift in the Democratic Party's long-standing consensus on US foreign policy towards Israel. Younger Democrats, in particular, are increasingly critical of America's reflexive support for Israel and are starting to vote accordingly. The controversy over Omar's comments highlights the challenges faced by critics of US-Israel policy, who must be careful in their choice of words to avoid accusations of anti-Semitism. While Omar's defenders argue that her comments were destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic regardless of their content, some Democrats, including Jewish allies, have expressed concern over the hurtful nature of her remarks. The decision to bring the issue to the House floor has created an unnecessary split within the Democratic Party, and leaders could gain more credibility by addressing the issue internally and rejecting attempts to criminalize boycotts of Israel. However, pretending that Omar's comments were innocent does no favors for anyone, especially not the Palestinians.
END OF SUMMARY.
