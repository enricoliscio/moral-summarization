Okay, I need to summarize this article about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy around her comments regarding Israel. The article is quite detailed, so I'll have to extract the main points without getting bogged down in every detail.

First, the article talks about Omar's remarks during a panel discussion where she mentioned "political influence that says it's okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country." She later tweeted about not pledging support to a foreign country, which some saw as playing into anti-Semitic tropes about dual loyalty. The Democratic leadership is reacting by scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, though not naming her. This is a significant move, as they usually handle such issues privately.

The article also discusses the broader context, mentioning that Omar's comments are happening at a time when there's a shift in the Democratic Party's stance on Israel. Younger Democrats are less likely to see Israel as an ally. There's a breakdown of the long-standing consensus on U.S. foreign policy towards Israel, partly due to Netanyahu's alliance with the GOP.

Omar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women in Congress and are prominent critics of U.S. policy in Israel. They're facing backlash, especially from the right, but also from some within the Democratic Party. The article points out that while some progressive Jews support Omar, many are hurt by her comments, and Democrats can't afford to alienate this voting bloc.

The author criticizes the Democratic leadership for bringing this issue to the floor, suggesting it's a poor use of resources. They argue that the focus should instead be on more pressing issues like investigating the president's history. The summary should highlight the tension between supporting Omar's criticism and addressing concerns about anti-Semitism, as well as the broader implications for U.S. policy towards Israel.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the key points: Omar's remarks, the Democratic response, the shift in party stance, the impact on Palestinian support, and the criticism of the floor vote decision.

SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) and her comments about Israel has reignited debates over dual loyalty and anti-Semitism. Omar's remarks during a panel discussion and subsequent tweet about not pledging support to a foreign country were perceived as invoking anti-Semitic tropes. In response, Democratic leadership is considering a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, a move seen as unnecessary by some. The article highlights the broader shift in the Democratic Party's stance on Israel, with younger members increasingly critical of U.S. support for Israeli policies. Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib are prominent critics, but their comments have drawn backlash, including from some Jewish allies. The article argues that while Omar's supporters claim her criticisms are being unfairly smeared, Democrats must balance supporting Palestinian justice with avoiding language that risks alienating Jewish voters. The decision to bring the issue to the floor is criticized as a poor use of resources, with the focus instead on addressing more pressing issues like the president's history. The controversy underscores the tension between challenging Israel's policies and avoiding anti-Semitic perceptions. END OF SUMMARY.
