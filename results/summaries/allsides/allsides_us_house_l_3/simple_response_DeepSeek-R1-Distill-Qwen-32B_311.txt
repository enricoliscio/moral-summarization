Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments on Israel and the resulting controversy. The author is critical of the Democratic leadership's response and discusses the broader implications for U.S. foreign policy.

First, I'll identify the main points: Omar's remarks, the reaction from Democrats, the context of U.S.-Israel relations, the impact on Palestinian support, and the author's stance on the issue.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I should highlight the controversy, the internal party dynamics, and the moral implications. Also, I must maintain the author's perspective, which seems to support Omar but is critical of the handling of the issue.

I'll start by mentioning the controversy, then move to the Democratic response, touch on the broader policy implications, and conclude with the author's view on the importance of language and support for Palestinians.

Make sure to include key terms like "anti-Semitic tropes," "U.S. support for Israel," and "moral framing." Keep it concise but comprehensive.

Finally, ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) and her comments on Israel, which were perceived as playing into anti-Semitic tropes about dual loyalty. Democratic leadership has taken the unusual step of scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, though not naming Omar. The author critiques this move, arguing it distracts from more pressing issues like investigations into the president's history. The piece highlights the broader tension in the Democratic Party over U.S. support for Israel and the need for careful language to avoid reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes. It also addresses the moral imperative to avoid alienating Jewish allies while advocating for Palestinian justice. The author emphasizes that Omar's criticism of U.S.-Israel policy is likely to be smeared as anti-Semitic regardless of her words, but argues that Democrats should focus on more deserving targets of censure, like Steve King or Duncan Hunter. The article underscores the breaking consensus on U.S. foreign policy in Israel, driven by younger Democrats, and the importance of addressing anti-Semitism and Palestinian rights without exploiting whataboutism. END OF SUMMARY.
