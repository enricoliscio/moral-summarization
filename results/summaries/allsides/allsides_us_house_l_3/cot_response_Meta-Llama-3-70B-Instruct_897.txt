SUMMARY:
The controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has sparked a heated debate. While Omar's defenders argue that her criticism of America's Israel policy was destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic, her words have been hurtful to many American Jews. The Democratic Party's decision to condemn dual-loyalty smears without referring to Omar by name is problematic and a needless split in the party. Instead of quietly meeting with Omar, Democratic leaders should focus on more pressing issues, such as investigating the president's business and political history. The controversy has highlighted the need for careful language and the importance of avoiding anti-Semitic tropes. However, the party's stance on Israel remains unjust, and activists are calling for a revision of American policy in Israel and justice for the long-oppressed Palestinians. END OF SUMMARY.
