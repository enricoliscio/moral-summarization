SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has sparked a heated debate. While some defend her criticism of US-Israel policy, others argue that her language can be seen as anti-Semitic. The author argues that Omar's supporters should acknowledge the potential harm of her words, even if unintentional, and that Democrats cannot afford to alienate Jewish voters. The decision to condemn dual-loyalty smears without referencing Omar by name is problematic, as it prioritizes party unity over addressing the issue. The author suggests that Democrats should focus on more pressing issues, like investigating the president's business history, rather than circling the wagons around Omar. Ultimately, the controversy highlights the need for careful language and a nuanced approach to the Israel-Palestine debate.

END OF SUMMARY.
