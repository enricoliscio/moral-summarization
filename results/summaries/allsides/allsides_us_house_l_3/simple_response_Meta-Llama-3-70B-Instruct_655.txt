SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has sparked a heated debate. While Omar's defenders argue that her criticism of America's Israel policy was destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic, others believe that her language was problematic and played into anti-Semitic tropes. The author argues that if one supports a revision of American policy in Israel and justice for Palestinians, they cannot have a prominent critic of Israel policy repeatedly tripping over language that can be read as anti-Semitic. The author also criticizes the Democratic Party's handling of the situation, stating that instead of quietly meeting with Omar, they are scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears. The author believes that this is a misplaced priority and that Democrats should focus on more pressing issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
