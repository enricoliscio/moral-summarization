SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments on Israel has sparked a heated debate. Omar's remarks about "allegiance to a foreign country" and her tweet about not being expected to "pledge support to a foreign country" have been criticized for perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes. Instead of addressing the issue quietly, Democratic leadership has scheduled a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, without directly referencing Omar. This move is problematic, as it deflects attention from the president's questionable business and political history. The left's circling of wagons around Omar, coupled with the tendency to downplay her comments, is also concerning. To change the debate on Israel, it's crucial to be deliberate with language, avoiding anti-Semitic tropes. Uncritical defenders of Israeli policy often use "what aboutism" to redirect attention from crimes committed against Palestinians. The controversy is unfolding as America's two-party consensus on Israel is breaking down, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of U.S. support for Israel.

END OF SUMMARY.
