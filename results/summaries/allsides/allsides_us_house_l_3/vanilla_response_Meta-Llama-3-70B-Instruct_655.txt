SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has sparked a heated debate. Omar's remarks about allegiance to a foreign country were criticized for playing into anti-Semitic tropes. Instead of addressing the issue quietly, Democratic leadership has scheduled a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, without referencing Omar by name. The author argues that while Omar's defenders are correct that her criticism of US-Israel policy was destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic, it's still important to be deliberate with language to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The controversy comes at a time when the two-party consensus on US-Israel policy is breaking down, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of Israel's occupation of the West Bank. The author suggests that Democratic leaders should focus on more pressing issues and avoid alienating Jewish voters, a critical constituency.
