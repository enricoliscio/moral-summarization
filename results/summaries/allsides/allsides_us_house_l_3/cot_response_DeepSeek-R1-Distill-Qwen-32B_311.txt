Okay, so the user has provided a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. They've broken it down into two steps: first, identifying all the single words that are morally framed, and second, writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" words mean. These are words that carry a moral judgment or implication, such as "controversy," "anti-Semitic," "outrage," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each word that fits this criteria.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The summary should be no longer than 200 words and should include the identified morally framed words. I have to make sure that the summary captures the essence of the article, highlighting the key points about Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments, the Democratic response, the broader context of Israel policy, and the implications for the Democratic Party and its base.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and maintains the moral tone present in the original text. It's important to balance between being concise and comprehensive, making sure not to omit critical aspects of the controversy.

Finally, I'll structure the response with STEP 1 listing each morally framed word and then the SUMMARY section following the specified format. I need to be careful with the word count and the structure to meet the user's requirements accurately.

**SUMMARY:**  

The controversy over freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel highlights the moral complexities of addressing U.S. foreign policy in Israel. Omar's remarks about allegiance to a foreign country were interpreted as anti-Semitic, sparking outrage and accusations of dual loyalty. Democratic leaders, instead of addressing the issue internally, scheduled a floor vote to condemn anti-Semitic smears, though not naming Omar. This move is seen as problematic, as it distracts from more pressing issues like investigating the president's history. Critics argue that Omar's comments, while potentially hurtful, were not inherently anti-Semitic, and her criticism of U.S. policy in Israel should not be conflated with anti-Semitism. However, the broader context of Israel policy in the U.S. is increasingly contentious, with younger Democrats questioning the party's unwavering support for Israel. Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, as vocal critics, have become focal points for both support and backlash. While some progressive Jews support Omar, others find her comments hurtful, making it essential for Democrats to balance their approach to avoid alienating Jewish allies. The decision to bring the issue to the floor is criticized as unnecessary, as it risks splitting the party and diverting attention from more pressing issues like combating racism and Islamophobia. END OF SUMMARY.
