SUMMARY:

The controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has reignited, with Democrats scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears without referring to her by name. While Omar's defenders argue that her criticism of US-Israel policy was destined to be smeared as anti-Semitic, her language has been problematic and played into anti-Semitic tropes. The debate around Israel policy in the US is shifting, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of unconditional US support for Israel. Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib have become prominent critics of US-Israel policy, and their successful campaigns have inspired many on the left. However, Democrats cannot afford to alienate American Jews, a critical voting bloc, and should listen to their concerns about Omar's words being hurtful. The decision to bring this issue to the floor is seen as unnecessary and may open up a split within the party.

END OF SUMMARY.
