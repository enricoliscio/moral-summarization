Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that must be included. I should start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the controversy around Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments regarding Israel and dual loyalty. It touches on the political influence, the scheduling of a floor vote to condemn anti-Semitic smears, and the broader implications for U.S. policy towards Israel. The author criticizes both the Democratic leadership for addressing Omar's comments and the broader context of anti-Semitism and Palestinian oppression.

I need to ensure that the summary includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I'll structure the summary to cover the key points: Omar's remarks, the Democratic response, the moral implications, the context of Israel's policies, and the potential consequences for the Democratic party and Palestinian justice.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start by mentioning Omar's comments, then the Democratic reaction, followed by the criticism of their approach, and end with the importance of addressing anti-Semitism and the need for careful language to support Palestinian justice.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral terms and maintain the author's framing. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key points are covered without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The controversy over freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel highlights the moral complexities of political influence and allegiance in U.S. foreign policy. Omar's remarks about not pledging support to a foreign country were interpreted as anti-Semitic, sparking a debate over dual loyalty and justice for Palestinians. Democratic leadership scheduled a floor vote to condemn anti-Semitic smears, though some argue this step is misguided, especially when more egregious actors like Steve King or Duncan Hunter remain unaddressed. The article critiques the tendency to deflect attention from Israel's occupation and crimes against Palestinians by invoking "what aboutism," while also acknowledging the harm caused by Omar's language. The moral framing underscores the need for careful word choice to avoid perpetuating anti-Semitism, even as the U.S. reevaluates its support for Israel's policies. The breakdown of the two-party consensus on Israel highlights the growing divide, with younger Democrats increasingly questioning the alliance. While Omar's defenders argue her comments were innocent, the article emphasizes the importance of avoiding language that can be read as anti-Semitic, not just for political expediency but because it is the right thing to do. The kerfuffle risks splitting the Democratic party and alienating Jewish allies, while also failing to address the systemic oppression of Palestinians. END OF SUMMARY.
