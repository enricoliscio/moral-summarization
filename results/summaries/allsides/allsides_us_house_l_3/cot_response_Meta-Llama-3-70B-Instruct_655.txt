SUMMARY:
The controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel has sparked a heated debate. While some defend her remarks as criticism of American policy, others see them as anti-Semitic tropes. The Democratic Party's decision to condemn dual-loyalty smears without referring to Omar by name is seen as problematic. The article argues that if one supports a revision of American policy in Israel and justice for Palestinians, they cannot afford to have the country's most prominent elected critic of America's Israel policy repeatedly tripping over language that can be read as anti-Semitic. The author emphasizes the importance of being deliberate about word choice, even in the face of attacks and insinuations from other members of Congress. The controversy is taking place at a time when America's long two-party consensus on American foreign policy in Israel is breaking down, and younger Democrats are increasingly critical of Israel's policies.
