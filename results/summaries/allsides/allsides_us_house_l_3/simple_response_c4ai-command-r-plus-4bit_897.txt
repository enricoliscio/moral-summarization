SUMMARY: There is an ongoing controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments about Israel, which have been perceived by some as anti-Semitic. Omar's remarks have sparked a debate within the Democratic Party, with some defending her right to criticize Israel and others condemning her use of language that plays into anti-Semitic tropes. The controversy has brought to light the changing attitudes towards Israel among younger Democrats, who are increasingly critical of the country's policies and the Democratic Party's unthinking commitment to them. While it is important to call out anti-Semitism, it is also crucial to recognize the problematic nature of uncritical defenses of Israeli policy, which often deflect attention from the country's illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. The controversy over Omar's comments highlights the need for careful and deliberate language when discussing Israel-Palestine, even in the face of racist and Islamophobic attacks. It also underscores the importance of listening to allies when they express hurt and offense, regardless of political expediency. While Omar's comments were not innocent, the decision to bring the issue to the floor of the House is counterproductive and risks alienating Democratic voters.
