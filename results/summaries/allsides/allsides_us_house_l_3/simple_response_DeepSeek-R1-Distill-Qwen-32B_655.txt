Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments and the controversy surrounding them. It's a bit complex, so I'll break it down.

First, the article discusses Omar's remarks about allegiance to a foreign country, which some saw as anti-Semitic. The Democratic leadership's reaction is unusual, scheduling a floor vote against dual-loyalty smears but not naming her. The author criticizes this move, suggesting it's not the best use of time when more pressing issues exist.

The moral framing here is about balancing free speech with avoiding anti-Semitic tropes. The article argues that while Omar's intentions might be good, her wording can be problematic and alienates allies, including Jewish Democrats. It's important to be careful with language to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes.

The article also touches on the broader context of U.S. policy towards Israel, noting a shift in younger Democrats' views. It's a critical moment as the consensus on Israel policy is breaking down, especially with Netanyahu's alliance with the GOP.

I need to make sure the summary captures the controversy, the Democratic response, the moral implications of language, and the broader political context. Keeping it under 200 words and preserving the moral aspects is key. I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) and her comments about Israel highlights the delicate balance between free speech and avoiding anti-Semitic tropes. Omar's remarks about allegiance to a foreign country were seen as echoing dual-loyalty smears, a charge often leveled against Jews. Democratic leadership's decision to schedule a floor vote condemning such smears, while not naming Omar, reflects the party's internal conflict over addressing anti-Semitism versus supporting Omar's criticism of U.S. Israel policy. The article argues that Omar's language, while not explicitly anti-Semitic, risks reinforcing harmful stereotypes and alienating Jewish allies, a key Democratic voting bloc. It also critiques the broader trend of using "what aboutism" to deflect attention from Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Palestinian plight. The piece underscores the importance of careful word choice, even in the face of anti-Semitic attacks on Omar, to avoid perpetuating harmful narratives. The controversy occurs as the long-standing consensus on U.S. Israel policy is eroding, particularly among younger Democrats. While Omar's defenders argue her criticism was destined to be smeared, the article suggests that Democrats must balance supporting her while avoiding actions that could harm their coalition or the Palestinian cause. END OF SUMMARY.
