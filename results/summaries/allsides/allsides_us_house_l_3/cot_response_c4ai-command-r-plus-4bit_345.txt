SUMMARY: There is an ongoing controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar and her comments about Israel, which have been deemed anti-Semitic. Omar's remarks have sparked a debate within the Democratic Party, with some defending her right to criticize American policy towards Israel while others condemn her use of language that perpetuates anti-Semitic tropes. The controversy has brought to light the changing attitudes towards Israel among younger Democrats, who are increasingly questioning the party's unthinking commitment to Israeli policies. Despite the problematic nature of Omar's comments, her defenders argue that her criticism of Israel was bound to be smeared as anti-Semitic regardless of her words or actions. The article criticizes Democratic leaders for their handling of the situation, arguing that they are creating an unnecessary split within the party by publicly condemning Omar instead of dealing with the issue internally. It also emphasizes the importance of being deliberate in word choice, even in the face of nightmarish attacks and the unacceptable actions of other problematic actors. The breakdown of the two-state peace process and the shifting public opinion on Israel further complicate the matter. While younger Democrats view the issue as a problem, changing America's long-standing foreign policy in Israel will be challenging. The article concludes by acknowledging the challenges faced by Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib as the first Muslim women in Congress, and calls for support in their efforts to persevere through coordinated campaigns of hate and lies.
END OF SUMMARY.
