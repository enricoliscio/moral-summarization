Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments regarding Israel, the controversy around them, and the reactions from different political sides. The author is discussing the moral implications of her statements and the broader context of U.S. foreign policy towards Israel.

I need to make sure I include the key morally charged words like "influence," "allegiance," "condemn," "oppressed," "justice," "attacks," "crimes," "genocide," etc. The summary should reflect the author's perspective that while Omar's intentions might be good, her wording can be seen as anti-Semitic, which complicates efforts to change U.S. policy on Israel.

I should structure the summary to cover the controversy, the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, the impact on Palestinian rights, and the broader implications for U.S. foreign policy. I need to balance the support for Omar's right to criticize with the need to avoid language that can be misconstrued as anti-Semitic.

Let me start drafting, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep it concise.

SUMMARY: The controversy surrounding freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments on Israel highlights the delicate balance between criticizing U.S. foreign policy and avoiding anti-Semitic tropes. Omar's remarks about "allegiance to a foreign country" were seen as problematic, prompting Democratic leaders to schedule a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, though not naming her. Critics argue that her language, while intended to question U.S. support for Israel, risks reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes. This debate occurs amid a growing shift in Democratic views on Israel, with younger members increasingly critical of the U.S.-Israel alliance. The article emphasizes the moral imperative to avoid language that could be interpreted as anti-Semitic, even as it acknowledges the need to address Israel's policies toward Palestinians. The author warns that Omar's comments, while not inherently anti-Semitic, risk alienating Jewish allies and complicating efforts to push for justice for Palestinians. The broader context includes the Republican embrace of Islamophobia and the ongoing conflict in Israel-Palestine, where Israel's occupation and policies have led to widespread oppression. The article underscores the importance of deliberate language in addressing these issues, while criticizing the Democratic leadership for focusing on Omar's comments over more pressing concerns like Steve King or Duncan Hunter. END OF SUMMARY.
