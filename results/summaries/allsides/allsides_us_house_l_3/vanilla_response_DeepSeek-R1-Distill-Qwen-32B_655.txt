Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments on Israel. Let me read through the article first to get a good grasp of the main points.

The article starts by talking about how Omar's comments reignited a controversy. She mentioned "political influence that says it's okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country," and then tweeted about not pledging support to a foreign country, which some saw as playing into anti-Semitic tropes about dual loyalty. The Democratic leadership decided to schedule a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, but without naming her. The author seems critical of this move, suggesting it's not the best use of time when there are more pressing issues.

The article then discusses the broader context, mentioning other problematic figures like Steve King and the president's comments at a rally. It points out that while supporting Palestinian justice is important, Omar's language is causing issues because it can be interpreted as anti-Semitic, even if she didn't explicitly charge anyone with dual loyalty. The author emphasizes the importance of careful word choice, especially when dealing with such sensitive topics.

There's a mention of how some defenders of Israeli policy use "what about" arguments to deflect attention from Palestinian issues. The article also notes a shift in American public opinion, particularly among younger Democrats, who are less supportive of Israel's policies. Omar and Rashida Tlaib are highlighted as the first Muslim women in Congress and as prominent critics of U.S. Israel policy, which makes them targets for the right-wing.

The author argues that while Omar's comments were likely to be smeared as anti-Semitic regardless, the Democratic leadership's decision to bring the issue to the floor is unnecessary and splits the party. They suggest that instead, the party should focus on more pressing issues and internal discussions, rather than public condemnation.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Omar's comments, the Democratic response, the broader context of anti-Semitism and dual loyalty, the shift in public opinion, and the critique of the Democratic leadership's handling of the issue.

I should make sure to include that the article discusses both the controversy and the implications for U.S. policy towards Israel, as well as the internal dynamics within the Democratic party. I'll also highlight the tension between supporting Palestinian justice and avoiding anti-Semitic tropes.

Let me structure this step by step:

1. Introduce the controversy over Omar's comments.
2. Mention the Democratic leadership's response.
3. Discuss the broader context of anti-Semitism and dual loyalty.
4. Note the shift in public opinion, especially among younger Democrats.
5. Highlight Omar and Tlaib's roles and the criticism they face.
6. Critique the Democratic leadership's handling and suggest alternative actions.

I'll make sure each point is brief and flows logically into the next. Also, I need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details that might exceed the word limit.

Now, putting it all together into a coherent summary within 200 words.
