Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Rep. Ilhan Omar and the controversy surrounding her comments on Israel. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about Omar's comments during a panel discussion where she mentioned "political influence that says it's okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country." Then she tweeted about not wanting to pledge support to a foreign country, which some saw as playing into anti-Semitic tropes about dual loyalty. The Democratic leadership decided to schedule a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears, but without naming her. The author seems critical of this move, suggesting it's not the best use of their time, especially when there are more pressing issues like investigating the president's history.

The article then discusses the broader context, mentioning how supporting a revision of U.S. policy towards Israel is challenging because of the risk of being labeled anti-Semitic. It talks about the difficulty in changing the debate and the need for careful language. There's also a mention of the Republican Party's embrace of Islamophobia and how that's problematic.

It goes on to say that the controversy is happening at a time when the consensus on U.S. foreign policy towards Israel is breaking down, especially among younger Democrats. Omar and Rashida Tlaib are highlighted as the first Muslim women elected to Congress and as high-profile critics of U.S. Israel policy. The article notes that while some on the left support them, others, including some Jews, find Omar's comments hurtful, and Democrats need to balance supporting her without alienating Jewish voters.

The author criticizes the Democratic leadership for bringing the issue to the floor, suggesting it's better to handle it internally and focus on more pressing issues like other problematic figures in the party. The conclusion is that while Omar's comments were not innocent, the Democrats' approach isn't helping the cause of justice for Palestinians.

So, to summarize, the key points are:
- Omar's comments and the perception of anti-Semitism.
- Democratic leadership's response and its implications.
- The broader context of changing U.S. policy towards Israel.
- The challenge of balancing support for Omar without alienating Jewish voters.
- Criticism of the Democratic approach and the need for a better strategy.

I need to condense these points into a summary under 200 words, ensuring it's clear and concise.
