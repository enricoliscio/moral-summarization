SUMMARY: Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar has caused controversy with her comments about Israel, which have been perceived as anti-Semitic. Democratic leadership has taken the unprecedented step of scheduling a floor vote to condemn dual-loyalty smears without referring to her by name. While there are more important issues for the Democratic Party to address, the language used by Omar cannot be ignored as it may be interpreted as perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes. Changing the debate about Israel in the United States is already an uphill battle, and careful word choice is essential, especially when considering the Israeli right's core constituency in America. It is important to call out deliberately or accidentally anti-Semitic language, even while recognizing the unfair scrutiny and attacks that Omar has faced. The controversy surrounding Omar's comments comes at a time when the two-party consensus on American foreign policy in Israel is breaking down, with younger Democrats increasingly critical of reflexive support for Israel. The decision to bring this issue to the floor of the House has opened up a split in the Democratic Party, and it remains to be seen if Omar can be persuaded to avoid anti-Semitic tropes in her future remarks.
END OF SUMMARY.
