SUMMARY:
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that will decide whether a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post information about state-funded abortions and contraceptives violates the free speech rights of anti-abortion groups. The Christian non-profit facilities, often called "crisis pregnancy centers," argue that the law forces them to promote abortion, which goes against their pro-life beliefs and violates their First Amendment rights. California, led by Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra, justifies the law as a way to ensure women are fully informed about their healthcare options and the nature of different facilities. The law has been upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the Supreme Court's decision to take up the case could have far-reaching implications for both Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states that seek to regulate anti-abortion pregnancy centers or abortion clinics. The case also adds to a series of free speech cases before the conservative-majority court, including one involving a Christian baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.
