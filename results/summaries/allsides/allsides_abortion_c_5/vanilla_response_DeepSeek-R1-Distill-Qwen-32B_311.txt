Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law. The law requires private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The challengers are Christian-based non-profits, often called crisis pregnancy centers. They argue that the law violates their First Amendment free speech rights. 

The article mentions that the law, called the Reproductive FACT Act, was passed by a Democratic legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown. California's argument is that the law is necessary to inform women about state programs. The challengers, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, say the government shouldn't force them to advertise something they oppose. 

The law requires licensed facilities to post notices about state programs, and non-licensed ones to add another notice about their lack of medical supervision. The 9th Circuit upheld the law, and the Supreme Court is now taking up the case. If the Court strikes down the law, it might affect similar regulations in other states, both Democratic and Republican leaning. 

The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I need to include the key points: the Supreme Court's decision to hear the case, the nature of the law, the arguments from both sides, and the potential implications. I should avoid getting too bogged down in details like the number of facilities or other cases mentioned. 

I'll structure the summary by first stating the main action (Court agrees to hear the case), then explain the law and its requirements, outline the arguments from both sides, and conclude with the possible broader implications. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me make sure to include the important elements without overcomplicating it.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post signs about state-funded abortion services, which anti-abortion groups argue violates free speech rights. The law, the Reproductive FACT Act, aims to inform women about state programs offering abortions and contraceptives. Challengers, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, argue the law forces them to promote abortion, which conflicts with their mission. California defends the law as a public health measure to ensure women are fully informed. The court's decision could impact similar regulations nationwide, affecting both Democratic and Republican states. END OF SUMMARY.
