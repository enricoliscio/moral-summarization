Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law that requires crisis pregnancy centers to post signs about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The challengers argue it's a free speech issue, while California defends it as ensuring informed decisions.

First, I'll identify the key points: the law's requirement, the plaintiffs' arguments about free speech, the state's justification for the law, and the implications of the Supreme Court's decision. The author used words like "punish," "healthcare," "care," "backed," "struck," and "refusal." I need to include these in the summary.

I should structure the summary to mention the Supreme Court's decision to hear the case, the law's requirements, the challengers' stance on free speech, the state's argument about informed decisions, and the potential broader implications. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential elements without getting too detailed. I'll start with the court's action, then the law's details, the arguments from both sides, and end with the implications of the case.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary points and the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post signs about state-funded abortions and contraceptives, arguing it violates free speech. The law, backed by Democrats, aims to ensure women are fully informed about healthcare options. Challengers, including Christian-based non-profits, argue the law punishes pro-life centers for refusing to advertise abortion services, claiming it coerces speech. California defends the law as a responsibility to regulate healthcare and ensure access to information for personal decisions. The case could impact how states regulate anti-abortion facilities, potentially affecting both Democratic and Republican-leaning states. The court's conservative majority often supports free speech arguments, as seen in recent cases. END OF SUMMARY.
