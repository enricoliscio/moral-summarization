Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law. The law requires crisis pregnancy centers to post signs about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The centers argue this violates their free speech rights. 

First, I'll identify the key points: the law is from 2015, passed by Democrats, and signed by Governor Jerry Brown. The centers, which are Christian-based, are challenging it. They argue the law forces them to promote abortions, which they oppose. California defends the law as ensuring women are informed about their healthcare options. The 9th Circuit upheld the law, and now the Supreme Court will decide. 

I should also mention the potential implications: if the Court rules against the law, it could affect similar regulations in other states, both Democratic and Republican. Additionally, the Court is handling other free speech cases, showing a trend towards addressing such issues.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by introducing the case, explaining both sides' arguments, and noting the broader implications. I'll make sure to include the key players: the Alliance Defending Freedom representing the centers, and California's Attorney General. Also, the context of previous rulings, like the Texas case and the North Carolina ultrasound law, adds depth.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Let me make sure all essential elements are covered without going into too much detail. The summary should flow logically, starting with the Court's action, the law's requirements, the challengers' stance, California's defense, the potential impact, and related cases.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all necessary points.
