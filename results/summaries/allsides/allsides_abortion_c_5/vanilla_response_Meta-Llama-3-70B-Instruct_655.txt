SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a California law that requires private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The law's challengers, Christian-based non-profit facilities, argue that the law violates their free speech rights by forcing them to post information they disagree with. California argues that the law is necessary to ensure women know about state programs providing abortions and birth control. The Supreme Court's decision could have implications for laws regulating anti-abortion pregnancy centers in Democratic-leaning states and abortion clinics in Republican-leaning states. The court has taken a series of cases involving free speech arguments, which its conservative majority is often receptive to.
