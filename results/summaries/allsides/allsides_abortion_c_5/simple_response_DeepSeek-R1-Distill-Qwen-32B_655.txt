Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law. The law requires crisis pregnancy centers, which are anti-abortion, to post signs about state-funded abortion services. The centers argue this violates their free speech rights under the First Amendment. California defends the law as ensuring women are informed about their healthcare options.

I should highlight the key points: the law's requirement, the challengers' argument about free speech, California's stance on informed choice, and the potential implications for other states. Also, mention the court's history with similar cases and the broader implications for free speech in healthcare regulation.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral perspectives from both sides. Make sure to include the names of the groups involved and the significance of the case in the context of previous rulings.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers, which counsel against abortion, to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortion and contraceptive services. The challengers, represented by a conservative Christian legal group, argue the law violates their First Amendment free speech rights, claiming the government shouldn’t force them to promote abortion. California defends the law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, as a means to ensure women are fully informed about healthcare options. The law requires licensed facilities to post notices about state programs offering abortions and birth control, while non-licensed centers must disclose their lack of medical supervision. The 9th Circuit upheld the law, and the Supreme Court’s decision could impact similar regulations nationwide. The case highlights tensions between free speech rights and the government’s role in ensuring informed healthcare decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
