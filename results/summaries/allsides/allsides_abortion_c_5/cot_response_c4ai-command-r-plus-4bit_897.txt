SUMMARY: 
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law that requires anti-abortion pregnancy centers to post information about how to obtain state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The law, passed by a Democratic legislature and governor, is justified by the state's responsibility to regulate the healthcare industry and ensure that women are informed about their options. The so-called "crisis pregnancy centers" argue that the law violates their freedom of speech by forcing them to advertise for abortions, which they counsel women against. The case is part of a broader debate over Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states' ability to regulate abortion-related services, with conservative-leaning courts often striking down restrictions on abortion clinics while upholding requirements on anti-abortion centers. The Supreme Court's decision could impact the ability of states to regulate abortion-related speech and impose restrictions on medical providers. The Court will also hear other cases involving free speech, including a challenge to a Minnesota law prohibiting political apparel at polling places and a case involving a conservative Christian baker's refusal to serve a gay couple.
