SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a California law that requires private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The facilities, often called "crisis pregnancy centers," argue that the law violates their free speech rights by forcing them to post information that goes against their beliefs. California argues that the law is necessary to ensure women know about state programs providing abortions and birth control. The court's decision could have implications for laws regulating anti-abortion pregnancy centers in Democratic-leaning states and abortion clinics in Republican-leaning states. The case is one of several involving free speech arguments that the court has taken up, including a challenge to a Minnesota law prohibiting political messages in polling stations and a case involving a Christian baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.
