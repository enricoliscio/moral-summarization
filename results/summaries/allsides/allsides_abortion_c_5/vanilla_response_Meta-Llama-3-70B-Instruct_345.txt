SUMMARY: The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a California law that requires private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The facilities, known as "crisis pregnancy centers," argue that the law violates their free speech rights by forcing them to promote a service they morally oppose. California argues that the law is necessary to ensure women are fully informed about the nature of different facilities and the state's programs providing abortions and birth control. The court's decision could have implications for laws regulating anti-abortion pregnancy centers in Democratic-leaning states and abortion clinics in Republican-leaning states. The court has taken a series of cases involving free speech arguments, which its conservative majority is often receptive to. A decision is expected by the end of June 2018. END OF SUMMARY.
