Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law. The law requires crisis pregnancy centers, which are anti-abortion facilities, to post signs about state-funded abortion services. The centers argue this violates their free speech rights. California, on the other hand, says it's about ensuring women are informed.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me go through the text again. Words like "pro-life," "anti-abortion," "coerced speech," "freedom," "informed," "choice," "rights," "justice," "oppression," "discrimination," "equality," "morality," "ethics," "fairness," "oppression," "discrimination," "equality," "morality," "ethics," "fairness" come up. These words carry moral weight and are central to the debate.

Now, for the summary. I need to include these moral terms and present both sides. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the court's action, then the law's requirements, the arguments from both sides, and the potential implications.

I should make sure to mention the pro-life centers' concern about coerced speech and California's argument about informed choice. Also, note the implications for other states and past rulings. Keep it balanced and include the moral framing elements.

Let me structure it: Introduce the case, explain the law, present both sides' arguments using the moral terms, mention the significance of the case, and conclude with possible impacts. Make sure to stay within the word limit.

Double-checking to include all key points: Supreme Court's decision, the law's requirements, free speech violation claim, California's stance on informed choice, the moral arguments from both sides, and the potential broader implications for other states' laws.

I think that covers everything. Time to put it all together concisely.

**SUMMARY:**  
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a California law requiring anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortion services. Pro-life advocates argue the law violates their First Amendment rights, claiming it forces them to promote an act they oppose. California defends the law, stating it ensures women are fully informed about their healthcare options, emphasizing the importance of choice and equality. The case highlights tensions between freedom of speech and the state's responsibility to provide accurate information. A ruling against the law could impact similar regulations nationwide, affecting both pro-life and abortion clinics. The outcome may also influence broader debates on morality, ethics, and fairness in healthcare access. END OF SUMMARY.
