Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include the morally framed words: punish, healthcare, care, backed, struck, refusal. I should make sure these words are included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Supreme Court agreed to hear a case about a California law requiring anti-abortion centers to post signs about state-funded abortions. The centers argue it's a free speech issue, while California says it's about informing women. The law was upheld by the 9th Circuit. The article mentions previous cases, like the Texas law and the New York City law, and other cases the court is handling.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. The challengers feel the law punishes them for their beliefs, so I'll use "punish." California's stance is about healthcare and ensuring women's access to care, so I'll use "healthcare" and "care." The law is Democratic-backed, so "backed" fits. The court struck down a Texas law, so "struck" is relevant. The refusal to provide services is another moral point, so I'll include "refusal."

I'll structure the summary to include these words naturally. I'll mention the Supreme Court's decision, the law's requirements, the challengers' argument about being punished, California's healthcare argument, the previous cases, and the broader implications regarding refusal and free speech.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral words are included without forcing them. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary.

Finalizing the summary, I'll make sure it flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral framing as specified.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a California law requiring anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to post signs about state-funded abortions and contraceptives violates free speech rights. The law, backed by Democrats, aims to ensure women are fully informed about healthcare options, including abortion and care. Challengers argue the law punishes pro-life centers for refusing to promote abortion, a violation of their First Amendment rights. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra defends the law, stating it empowers women by providing critical information for personal healthcare decisions. The law requires licensed facilities to post notices about state programs offering free or low-cost services, while non-licensed centers must disclose their lack of medical supervision. The 9th Circuit upheld the law, but the Supreme Court’s decision could impact similar regulations nationwide. If the court strikes down the law, it may limit states’ ability to regulate anti-abortion centers, potentially affecting both Democratic and Republican-leaning states. The case reflects broader debates over free speech, healthcare access, and the refusal to provide abortion-related information. END OF SUMMARY.
