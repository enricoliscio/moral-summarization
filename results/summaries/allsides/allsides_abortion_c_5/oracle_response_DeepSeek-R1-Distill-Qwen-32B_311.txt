Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article first to understand the context.

The article is about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law. The law requires crisis pregnancy centers, which are anti-abortion, to post signs about state-funded abortion services. The challengers argue this violates free speech, while California defends it as ensuring women's informed decisions.

The user specified that I need to include the words: punish, healthcare, care, backed, struck, refusal. I should make sure these words are in the summary.

I'll start by identifying the main points: the law's requirement, the challengers' argument about free speech, California's defense about informed decisions, the moral implications of coercion, and the potential broader impacts on healthcare regulations.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll structure it to include the key elements, making sure to use the specified moral words naturally. I should also mention the potential consequences for both pro-life and abortion clinics.

Let me draft a concise summary, ensuring all the moral terms are included and the framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a California law requiring anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to post signs about state-funded abortion services, which the challengers argue violates free speech rights. The law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, is backed by Democrats and aims to ensure women are fully informed about healthcare options. Challengers, including conservative Christian groups, argue the law punishes pro-life centers for refusing to advertise abortion services, which they cannot promote. They claim the state should protect freedom of speech and avoid coercing speech. California defends the law, stating it ensures women have access to information for personal healthcare decisions. The law requires licensed facilities to post notices about state programs for free or low-cost abortions and contraceptives, while non-licensed centers must disclose their lack of medical supervision. The case could impact how states regulate healthcare facilities and abortion access, potentially affecting both pro-life centers and abortion clinics. The courtâ€™s decision could influence similar laws nationwide, highlighting tensions between free speech and informed healthcare choices. END OF SUMMARY.
