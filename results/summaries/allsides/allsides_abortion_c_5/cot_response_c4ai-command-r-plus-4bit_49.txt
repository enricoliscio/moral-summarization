SUMMARY:
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that will decide whether a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post information about state-funded abortions and contraceptives violates the free speech rights of the centers, which are often anti-abortion and Christian-based. The law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, was passed by California's Democratic-led legislature and signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown in 2015. The law requires licensed healthcare facilities to post notices about state programs offering free or low-cost abortions and contraceptives, and for non-licensed facilities to disclose that they have no licensed medical providers. The case has been brought by conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, who argue that the law forces them to advertise for abortions, which they morally oppose. California's Democratic Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, defends the law as necessary to ensure women are fully informed about their healthcare options and the nature of different facilities. The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case could have significant implications for both Democratic and Republican-leaning states' abilities to regulate anti-abortion pregnancy centers and abortion clinics respectively. The court's conservative majority has shown a strong interest in free speech cases and will also hear challenges to a Minnesota law prohibiting political apparel at polling stations and a case involving a conservative Christian baker's refusal to serve a gay couple.
