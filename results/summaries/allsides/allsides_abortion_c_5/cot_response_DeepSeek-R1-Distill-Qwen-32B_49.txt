Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific task, so I should follow the steps carefully. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. The user mentioned that these are words like "pro-life," "anti-abortion," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out those words, making sure each is on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, keeping it under 200 words. I should include as many of those morally framed words as possible to maintain the author's perspective. The summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll make sure to cover the key points: the Supreme Court's decision to hear the case, the law in question, the arguments from both sides, and the implications of the case.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content without adding any personal opinions. I'll focus on the legal aspects, the parties involved, and the broader implications for both pro-life and abortion rights groups. Making sure to highlight the moral arguments presented by each side is crucial for preserving the framing.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the case is about a California law requiring pro-life centers to post information about state-funded abortions. The challengers argue it's a free speech issue, while California says it's about informed consent. The Supreme Court's decision could impact similar laws in other states. I'll make sure to include terms like "pro-life," "anti-abortion," "free speech," and "Roe v. Wade" to maintain the moral context.

I should also mention the potential broader implications, such as how the ruling could affect laws in both Democratic and Republican-leaning states. This shows the significance of the case beyond California. Keeping the summary within 200 words means being concise but comprehensive.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures all essential elements and maintains the moral framing as per the original article. Making sure that the language reflects the opposing viewpoints accurately is important to stay true to the source material.

**SUMMARY:**  

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law requiring pro-life centers to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives, which anti-abortion groups argue violates free speech rights. The law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, aims to ensure women are fully informed about healthcare options. Pro-life advocates, including crisis pregnancy centers, argue the law punishes them for declining to advertise abortion services, claiming it infringes on their First Amendment rights. California defends the law as a necessary measure to regulate the healthcare industry and provide women with essential information. The case could have broader implications for similar laws in other states, potentially affecting both pro-life and abortion rights groups. The Supreme Court's decision could set a precedent for how free speech and abortion rights are balanced in future cases. END OF SUMMARY.
