Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article mentions that the Supreme Court will decide if a California law requiring certain facilities to post signs about state-funded abortions and contraceptives violates free speech. These facilities are crisis pregnancy centers, which are Christian-based and often counsel against abortion. They argue that the law forces them to promote something they oppose, infringing on their First Amendment rights.

California's law, the Reproductive FACT Act, is meant to ensure women are informed about state services. The law requires licensed facilities to post notices about free or low-cost services, including abortions, and non-licensed ones to disclose their lack of medical providers.

The 9th Circuit upheld the law, and the Supreme Court previously declined a similar case in New York. The challengers include groups like the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, with many facilities in California.

The case could impact how states regulate these centers, affecting both Democratic and Republican-leaning states. The Supreme Court has been handling several free speech cases, including one about polling station apparel and a baker refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: the case, the law's requirements, the arguments from both sides, the potential implications, and the broader context of the Supreme Court's recent cases.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and includes all essential elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by first stating the court's decision, then the law's requirements, the arguments, the potential impact, and mention other relevant cases.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives, which the centers argue violates their First Amendment free speech rights. These centers, often Christian-based, counsel against abortion. California defends the law, passed in 2015, as ensuring women are informed about state healthcare services. The law requires licensed facilities to post notices about free or low-cost services, including abortions, and non-licensed ones to disclose their lack of medical providers. A lower court upheld the law, and the Supreme Court previously declined a similar case in New York. The outcome could impact how states regulate such centers, affecting both Democratic and Republican-leaning states. The case is part of the court's recent focus on free speech issues, including challenges to polling station apparel rules and a baker's refusal to serve a gay couple. END OF SUMMARY.
