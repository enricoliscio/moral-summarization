SUMMARY: The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a California law that requires private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The law's challengers, Christian-based non-profit facilities, argue that the law violates their free speech rights by forcing them to post information they disagree with. California argues that the law is necessary to ensure women know about state programs providing abortions and birth control. The court's decision could have implications for laws regulating anti-abortion pregnancy centers and abortion clinics in other states. The Supreme Court has previously upheld abortion rights and has been receptive to free speech arguments. The court will hear the case, along with other free speech challenges, including a case involving a conservative Christian baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. END OF SUMMARY.
