Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case regarding a California law that requires crisis pregnancy centers to post signs about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The challengers argue it violates free speech, while California defends it as ensuring women are informed. 

I should identify the key elements: the law, the plaintiffs, the arguments on both sides, and the implications. The user mentioned specific words like "punish," "healthcare," "care," "backed," "struck," and "refusal." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Then, mention the law requiring signs, the plaintiffs being crisis centers, their argument about free speech. California's defense is about informed decision-making. Include the moral words where they fit naturally. For example, the challengers feel the law punishes them, and California is about healthcare and care for women.

I should also note the potential implications if the law is struck down, affecting both Democratic and Republican states. Keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including all necessary points and the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortion and contraceptive services. The challengers, Christian-based non-profits, argue the law punishes them for declining to advertise abortion, violating their free speech rights. California defends the law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, as a way to ensure women are fully informed about healthcare options. The law requires licensed facilities to post notices about state programs offering free or low-cost abortions and contraceptives, while non-licensed facilities must disclose they lack medical supervision. The 9th Circuit upheld the law, but the challengers argue the state should not force them to promote an act they oppose. If the court strikes down the law, it could impact similar regulations nationwide. The case highlights tensions over free speech, healthcare access, and the role of government in regulating facilities that counsel against abortion. END OF SUMMARY.
