SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives violates free speech rights. The law, backed by Democrats, aims to ensure women are fully informed about the nature of different facilities, while anti-abortion challengers argue it punishes them for declining to advertise abortion services. The centers, often located near hospitals and abortion clinics, counsel women against having abortions and are staffed by people wearing medical garb. The law requires licensed facilities to post a notice about state programs providing abortions and birth control, while non-licensed facilities must post a notice stating they have no licensed medical provider. The court's decision could impact laws regulating anti-abortion pregnancy centers and abortion clinics in both Democratic- and Republican-leaning states. The case is one of several involving free speech arguments that the court's conservative majority is often receptive to.
