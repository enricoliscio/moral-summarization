SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a California law requiring private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs telling clients how to get state-funded abortions and contraceptives violates free speech rights. The law's challengers, Christian-based non-profit facilities, argue that the law punishes them for declining to advertise for abortions, which they cannot promote. California defends the law, saying it ensures women are fully informed about the nature of different facilities and have access to information they need when making personal healthcare decisions. The law requires licensed facilities to post a notice about state programs providing abortions and birth control, while non-licensed facilities must post a notice stating they have no licensed medical provider. The court's decision could impact laws in Democratic-leaning states regulating anti-abortion pregnancy centers and those in Republican-leaning states imposing requirements on abortion clinics. The court has taken a series of cases involving free speech arguments, including a conservative Christian baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. END OF SUMMARY.
