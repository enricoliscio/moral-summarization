SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a California law that requires private facilities counseling pregnant women against abortion to post information about how to obtain state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, was passed in 2015 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown. The Christian-based non-profit facilities, often called "crisis pregnancy centers," argue that the law violates their free speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. California, represented by Attorney General Xavier Becerra, defends the law as necessary to ensure women have access to accurate information about their healthcare options. The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case could have implications for similar laws in other states and for the broader debate over abortion rights and free speech. In addition to this case, the court has also taken up other cases involving free speech, including a challenge to a Minnesota law prohibiting political apparel at polling stations and a case involving a Christian baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.
