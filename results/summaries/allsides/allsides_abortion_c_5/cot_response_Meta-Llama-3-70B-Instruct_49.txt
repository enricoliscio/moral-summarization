SUMMARY:
The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a California law that requires crisis pregnancy centers to post signs informing clients about state-funded abortions and contraceptives. The centers, which counsel women against abortion, argue that the law violates their freedom of speech and forces them to promote a service they morally oppose. The law's defenders claim it ensures women are fully informed about the nature of different facilities and have access to information they need when making personal healthcare decisions. The court's decision could have implications for laws regulating abortion clinics in both Democratic and Republican-leaning states. The case is part of a series of free speech challenges being heard by the court, including a conservative Christian baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. END OF SUMMARY.
