Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Devin Kelley and the mass shooting in Texas. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. Police reports indicate he was dangerous and had mental disorders. He was later apprehended but eventually released.

Kelley had a troubled Air Force background, including a conviction for domestic violence in 2012. However, the Air Force failed to report this conviction to the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC), which meant he could legally purchase guns despite his criminal history. He bought two guns legally, which he used in the shooting.

The shooting happened in Sutherland Springs, where he killed 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounded 20 others. He was shot by a civilian and then killed himself. The article also discusses the political and legal implications, with lawmakers considering new legislation to prevent domestic violence offenders from buying guns.

Additionally, Kelley had a history of behavioral issues in school and family conflicts. The FBI is examining his phone for clues, but it's unclear if the family dispute motivated the attack. The incident reignited debates about gun control, with President Trump opposing stricter laws.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events, Kelley's background, the system failure, the consequences, and the aftermath. I should ensure the summary is clear and includes all critical details without unnecessary details.
