SUMMARY:
Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a troubled past, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. Despite his criminal record, he was able to purchase guns due to an "appalling" lapse by the Air Force, which failed to enter his conviction into a government database. Kelley's history was marked by "turbulence" and "danger," including behavior problems as a student and a private life filled with "conflict" and "threatening" behavior. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter reviews of gun purchases to prevent such "rampages" in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
