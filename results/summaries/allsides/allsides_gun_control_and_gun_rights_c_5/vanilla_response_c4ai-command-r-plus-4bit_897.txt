SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was committed by Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a history of mental health issues and domestic violence. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted. He was discharged from the Air Force with a bad conduct in 2014. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to an oversight by the Air Force in failing to enter his conviction into the required database. The shooting has brought attention to the issue of gun control and the background check system. Kelley's private life was marked by turbulence, including a dispute with his in-laws and threatening text messages to his mother-in-law. Texas school records also revealed numerous behavior problems during his student years. Authorities are still investigating the motive behind the shooting, which left 26 people dead, including an unborn child.
END OF SUMMARY.
