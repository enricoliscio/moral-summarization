Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words the author used that carry moral connotations. Let me go through the article again to pick out those key terms.

The article is about Devin Kelley, a former serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. The police report mentioned he was a danger to others and had mental disorders. He was later apprehended but ended up buying guns despite his criminal record.

I should include words like "shooting," "violence," "convicted," "sneaking," "threats," "apprehended," "killed," "dead," "wounded," "record," "purchases," "guilty," "assaulting," "failure," "legislation," "blocked," "suspensions," "drugs," "insubordination," "profanity," "skipping," "dishonesty," "threatening," "attacked," "lethal," "rampage."

I need to structure the summary to highlight the moral issues: his history of violence, the system's failure to prevent him from buying guns, and the consequences of that failure. I'll make sure to include the key events and the moral implications without going over 200 words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate as many of those words as possible while keeping it concise and coherent.

SUMMARY:  
Devin Kelley, the former U.S. serviceman behind the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled history marked by violence and mental instability. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence, and police were warned he posed a "danger to himself and others" after sneaking firearms onto a military base. Kelley, who suffered from mental disorders, was later convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, he passed background checks and purchased firearms legally. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a federal database, allowing him to acquire guns that he used in the shooting. Kelley killed 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounded 20 others before being killed during a failed getaway. His history of behavior problems, including suspensions for drugs, insubordination, and dishonesty, was also revealed. The case has reignited debates over gun laws and the need for stricter background checks. Legislation is proposed to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing firearms. Kelleyâ€™s rampage, described as lethal and violent, highlighted systemic failures in preventing such tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
