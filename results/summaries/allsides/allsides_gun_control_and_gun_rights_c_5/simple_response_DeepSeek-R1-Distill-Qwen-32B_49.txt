Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. The key points I need to include are:

1. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence.
2. He was reported as a danger to others and had mental disorders.
3. He was apprehended but later purchased guns despite his criminal record.
4. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a national database, allowing him to buy guns legally.
5. The shooting resulted in 26 deaths and 20 injuries.
6. The incident sparked debates on gun control and background checks.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the failure of the system to prevent Kelley from obtaining firearms and the consequences of that failure. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the essential points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me try to put this together step by step, ensuring each point is covered clearly and the moral implications are emphasized.

SUMMARY: Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 and injuring 20. Kelley had escaped a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence, with reports indicating he posed a danger due to mental disorders. Despite a criminal record, he legally purchased guns because the Air Force failed to report his conviction to a national database. This lapse in the system allowed him to acquire firearms, leading to the tragedy. The incident reignited debates on gun control and the need for stricter background checks, highlighting systemic failures in preventing such violence. END OF SUMMARY.
