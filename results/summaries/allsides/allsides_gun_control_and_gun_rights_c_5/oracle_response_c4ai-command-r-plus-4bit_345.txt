SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas was committed by a former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, who had a history of mental health issues and domestic violence. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to a failure by the Air Force to enter his conviction into the required background check database. This lapse has been called "appalling" and has prompted calls for legislation to block anyone convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns. Kelley's troubled past also included behavior problems as a student and a history of drug use, insubordination, and dishonesty. On Sunday, he stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and opened fire on worshipers, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. He later killed himself during a failed getaway attempt. The massacre has reignited debates about gun ownership and stricter reviews of gun purchases.
END OF SUMMARY.
