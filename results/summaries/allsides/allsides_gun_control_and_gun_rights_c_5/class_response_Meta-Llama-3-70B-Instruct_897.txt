SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was committed by Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a troubled past. In 2012, Kelley escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, having been caught sneaking firearms onto a U.S. Air Force base. He had a history of behavior problems, including nine suspensions for drugs, insubordination, and profanity, and was later convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite this, Kelley was able to purchase guns due to an "appalling" lapse in the Air Force's reporting of his conviction to a government database. On Sunday, Kelley stormed into a church, opening fire on worshipers and killing 26 people, including an unborn child. He was eventually killed by an armed civilian. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter reviews of gun purchases to prevent such tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
