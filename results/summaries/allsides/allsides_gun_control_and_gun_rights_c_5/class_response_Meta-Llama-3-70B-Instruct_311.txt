SUMMARY: A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, had a troubled past marked by violence, assault, and crime. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. He had also been caught sneaking firearms onto a U.S. Air Force base and had made death threats against his military commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to an "appalling" lapse by the Air Force, which failed to enter his conviction into a government database. On Sunday, Kelley stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and opened fire on worshipers, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. He was eventually killed by an armed civilian. The massacre has sparked a renewed debate over gun ownership and has led to calls for stricter gun laws. END OF SUMMARY.
