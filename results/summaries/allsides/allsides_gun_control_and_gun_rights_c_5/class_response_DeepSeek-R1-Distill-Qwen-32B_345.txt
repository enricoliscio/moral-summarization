Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. I'll start by reading through the article to identify the key points and the moral elements.

The article is about Devin Kelley, a former serviceman who committed a deadly mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital and had a history of domestic violence and mental issues. The Air Force failed to report his conviction, allowing him to buy guns legally. The shooting was one of the deadliest, and it led to discussions on gun control and background checks.

I need to include words like "deadliest," "shooting," "violence," "charges," "sneaking," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight his past, the system failures, and the consequences. I'll make sure each paragraph is concise, keeping the total under 200 words. I'll check that all the key moral points are covered without omitting important details.

SUMMARY:  
Devin Kelley, the former U.S. serviceman behind the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, had a troubled past marked by violence and mental instability. In 2012, he escaped a mental hospital while facing court-martial for domestic violence, and police were warned he posed a danger to others after sneaking firearms onto a military base. Kelley, who had been convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson, was later discharged from the Air Force in 2014. Despite his criminal history, he was able to legally purchase firearms due to the Air Force's failure to report his conviction to the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC), which prohibits gun sales to domestic violence offenders.  

On Sunday, Kelley stormed a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people and wounding 20, including an unborn child. He was later killed during a failed getaway. The case has reignited debates over gun control and background checks, with lawmakers proposing legislation to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns. Kelleyâ€™s history of behavioral issues, including drug use, insubordination, and threatening messages, further underscores the systemic failures that allowed him to carry out the massacre. The incident has been described as an appalling lapse in accountability, highlighting the need for stricter oversight and screening processes. END OF SUMMARY.
