Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Devin Kelley and the mass shooting in Texas. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, moral framing usually refers to the perspective or values presented in the story. So I should make sure to highlight the key moral issues like gun control, background checks, military oversight, etc.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Devin Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012, facing court-martial for domestic violence. He later committed a mass shooting in a church, killing 26 people. He had a history of domestic violence and mental issues. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a database, allowing him to buy guns legally despite his record. There's also mention of his troubled past in school and personal life.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points but stays under 200 words. I should focus on the key moral aspects: the failure of the system to prevent him from buying guns, the debate over gun control, and the implications of military oversight. Also, mention the legislative responses and the ongoing debate.

Let me structure this: start with the shooting, mention his background, the system's failure, the consequences, and the resulting calls for legislation. Keep it concise but cover all the main moral points.

SUMMARY: A former U.S. Air Force serviceman, Devin Kelley, carried out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people and injuring 20 at a church in Sutherland Springs. Kelley, who had a history of domestic violence and mental health issues, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges. Despite his criminal record, he legally purchased firearms due to a failure by the Air Force to report his conviction to a federal database. This oversight exposed a critical flaw in the background check system. Kelley's troubled past included multiple suspensions for behavioral issues in school and a violent history with his family. His actions reignited debates over gun control, with lawmakers proposing stricter legislation to prevent domestic violence offenders from purchasing firearms. The incident also highlighted systemic failures in military oversight and the need for improved communication between law enforcement and firearms dealers. END OF SUMMARY.
