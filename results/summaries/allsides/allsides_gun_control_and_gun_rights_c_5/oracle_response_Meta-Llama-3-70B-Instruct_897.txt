SUMMARY:

Devin Kelley, a former US serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had a troubled past, having been convicted of domestic violence and assaulting his first wife and stepson while serving in the Air Force. Despite this, he was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. Kelley had a history of behavior problems, including suspensions for drugs, insubordination, and dishonesty, and had been accused of making death threats against his military commanders. He was known to have a mental disorder and had previously escaped from a mental hospital. The attack has reignited the debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter reviews of gun purchases. The Air Force has opened an inquiry into the matter, and two senators plan to co-sponsor legislation aimed at ensuring that anyone convicted of domestic violence is blocked from legally purchasing a gun.
