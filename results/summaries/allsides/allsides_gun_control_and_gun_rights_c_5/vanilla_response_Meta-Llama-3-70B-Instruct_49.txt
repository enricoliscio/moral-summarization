SUMMARY:

A former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled past. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. A police report revealed that Kelley had been caught sneaking firearms onto a US Air Force base and had made death threats against his commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year, as the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a government database used for background checks. The failure has been called an "appalling" lapse. Kelley killed 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounded 20 others before killing himself. The incident has reignited the debate over gun ownership and background checks.
