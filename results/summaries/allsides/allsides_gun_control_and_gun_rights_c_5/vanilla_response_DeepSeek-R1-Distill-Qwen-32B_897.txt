Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Devin Kelley, who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He was a former U.S. serviceman. The key points are that he escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. Police reports mention he was dangerous, had mental disorders, and was caught with firearms. He was apprehended in Texas but later got out.

Kelley's background is important because he had a troubled past in the Air Force. He was convicted of domestic violence in 2012 but wasn't added to a government database, which should have prevented him from buying guns. Despite this, he passed background checks and bought guns, leading to the mass shooting where 26 were killed and 20 injured.

There's also mention of legislative efforts to prevent domestic violence offenders from buying guns, and the FBI's involvement in his case. The article discusses the debate over gun control in the U.S.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Kelley's background, the escape, the failure in the database, the shooting, and the aftermath, including the legislative response and the debate over gun control.
