SUMMARY: In Texas, a former serviceman, Devin Kelley, committed the deadliest mass shooting in the state's history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child. Kelley had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges and was later convicted. Police reports revealed that Kelley posed a danger to himself and others, had attempted to carry out death threats, and suffered from mental disorders. He was also convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson while serving in the Air Force. Despite his criminal record, Kelley passed background checks and purchased guns in San Antonio. The Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a government database used for screening gun buyers, which has been called an "appalling lapse." Kelley's troubled past also included behavior problems in school and turbulence in his adult life, including threatening text messages to his mother-in-law. The massacre has rekindled debates about gun ownership and stricter reviews of gun purchases. President Trump argued against stricter gun laws, stating they might have prevented the civilian who stopped Kelley from acting.
