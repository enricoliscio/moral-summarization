Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a detailed news piece about Devin Kelley and the Texas church shooting. First, I should understand the task: identify morally framed words and then write a concise summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to find all single words that carry moral connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words that imply blame, failure, danger, etc. Words like "escaped," "court-martial," "domestic violence," "convicted," "danger," "posed," "caught," "sneaking," "firearms," "death threats," "mental disorders," "troubled," "background," "stormed," "massacre," "killed," "unborn," "slaughter," "slaughtered," "wounded," "critical," "failed," "lapse," "failure," "blocked," "turmoil," "dishonesty," "conflict," "dispute," "massacre," "rekindled," "debate," "protected," "stricter," "prevented," "difference," "hundreds," "dead."

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, using as many of these moral words as possible. I'll focus on the key points: Kelley's escape, his violent past, the failed background checks, the shooting details, the aftermath, and the debate on gun laws.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral failings, like the Air Force's failure to report his conviction, the gun dealer's oversight, and the tragic outcome. I'll also mention the political response and the ongoing debate about gun control, emphasizing the moral implications of the events.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without being too verbose. I'll make sure each sentence includes a morally framed word where appropriate, keeping the tone aligned with the original article's framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key points are covered, preserving the moral context as the user requested.

**SUMMARY:**  
Devin Kelley, the former U.S. serviceman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a history of violence and mental instability. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence, which he later was convicted of. Police reports revealed he posed a danger, having attempted death threats and suffering from mental disorders. Kelley was apprehended after his escape but later re-entered civilian life, purchasing firearms despite his criminal record. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a government database, allowing him to buy guns legally. This lapse was described as "appalling." Kelleyâ€™s troubled past included numerous suspensions for behavioral issues and a history of domestic disputes. He killed 26 people, including an unborn child, in a church shooting before being wounded and killing himself. The incident reignited debates over gun control, with lawmakers proposing legislation to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing firearms. The case highlighted weaknesses in background checks and the ongoing conflict between gun rights and public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
