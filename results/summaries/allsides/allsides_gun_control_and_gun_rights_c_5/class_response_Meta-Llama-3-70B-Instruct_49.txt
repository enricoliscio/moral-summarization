SUMMARY: 

A former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled past. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. He had been caught sneaking firearms onto a US Air Force base and had made death threats against his commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to an "appalling" lapse by the Air Force, which failed to enter his conviction into a government database. On Sunday, Kelley stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and opened fire on worshipers, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. He was shot and killed by an armed civilian during a failed getaway attempt. The massacre has reignited a debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter laws to prevent such crimes.
