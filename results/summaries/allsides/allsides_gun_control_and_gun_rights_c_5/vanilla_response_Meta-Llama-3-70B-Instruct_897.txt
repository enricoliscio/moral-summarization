SUMMARY:

A police report revealed that Devin Kelley, the former US serviceman who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges. Kelley, who was later convicted, had been reported to pose a "danger to himself and others" and had attempted to carry out death threats against his military commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. The failure has been called an "appalling" lapse by a Republican congressman. The case has exposed a weak link in the system of background checks and has sparked a debate over gun ownership. Kelley killed 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounded 20 others before killing himself.
