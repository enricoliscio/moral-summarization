SUMMARY:

The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was committed by Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a troubled past. In 2012, Kelley escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. This "appalling" lapse allowed Kelley to pass criminal background checks. Kelley's history of behavior problems, domestic violence, and mental disorders should have prevented him from legally purchasing a gun. The tragedy has reignited the debate over gun ownership and background checks, with some lawmakers planning to introduce legislation to ensure that those convicted of domestic violence are blocked from purchasing guns. The case exposes a weak link in the system of background checks and highlights the need for stricter reviews of gun purchases.
