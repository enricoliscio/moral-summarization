SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was committed by Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a history of mental health issues and domestic violence. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted. Police reports reveal that Kelley posed a danger to himself and others, and had attempted to carry out death threats against his military commanders. He was convicted of assaulting his first wife and a stepson while serving in the Air Force, but the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a government database used for screening gun buyers. This allowed Kelley to purchase guns despite his criminal record. The shooting has sparked a debate over gun control and the effectiveness of background checks. Kelley's cell phone is being analyzed by the FBI, but they have not yet gained access to the device. Texas public school records show Kelley had behavior problems as a student, and authorities believe a domestic dispute with his in-laws may have been a motivating factor in the shooting.
END OF SUMMARY.
