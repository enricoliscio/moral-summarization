SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was committed by Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a history of mental health issues and domestic violence. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted. He was also found guilty of assaulting his first wife and stepson while serving in the Air Force, but his conviction was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center system, allowing him to pass background checks and purchase guns. Kelley's troubled past also included behavior problems in school and a history of domestic disputes with his in-laws. The shooting has sparked a debate over gun control and the effectiveness of background checks. President Trump argued that stricter gun laws would not have prevented the tragedy. The Air Force has opened an inquiry into the failure to report Kelley's conviction, and legislators are proposing new laws to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns.
END OF SUMMARY.
