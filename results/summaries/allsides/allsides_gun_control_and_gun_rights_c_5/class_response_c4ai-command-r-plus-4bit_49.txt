SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history has brought to light the troubled past of the gunman, Devin Kelley. Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, for which he was later convicted. The report also revealed that Kelley had been caught "sneaking firearms" onto the Air Force base and had been "attempting to carry out death threats" against his commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to a failure by the Air Force to enter his conviction into a national database. This "appalling" lapse has prompted an inquiry and calls for legislation to ensure that domestic violence convictions, whether in civilian or military court, prohibit individuals from legally purchasing guns. Kelley's private life was also marked by turbulence, with a history of threatening his mother-in-law and attacking worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, resulting in the death of 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley's actions and the failure of the system to prevent him from accessing guns highlight the ongoing debate over gun ownership and the need for stricter background checks to prevent such deadly assaults.
END OF SUMMARY.
