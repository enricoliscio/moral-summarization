SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history has brought to light a number of issues regarding gun control and the failures of the system in place to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The shooter, Devin Kelley, was a former U.S. serviceman with a history of domestic violence, mental health issues, and behavior problems, yet he was still able to legally purchase guns. This has highlighted a weak link in the system of background checks, as well as a failure on the part of the Air Force to transmit Kelley's criminal record into the necessary database. As a result, two U.S. senators are planning to co-sponsor legislation to ensure that anyone convicted of domestic violence is blocked from legally purchasing a gun. The shooting has also reignited the ongoing debate about gun control in the United States, with some calling for stricter gun laws, while others, like President Trump, argue that stricter laws would have made the situation worse. The moral issues at stake here are clear: the failure to prevent this tragedy has exposed a moral duty to act and prevent future tragedies, whether that be through improved background checks, stricter gun laws, or other means.
END OF SUMMARY.
