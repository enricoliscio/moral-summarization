Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Devin Kelley, the gunman in Texas, and his background. The key points are his escape from a mental hospital, his history of domestic violence, the failed background checks when he bought guns, and the debate over gun laws. I should highlight the moral issues like the system failures that allowed him to purchase firearms despite his record. Also, mention the tragic impact of the shooting and the ongoing debate it sparked. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Let me make sure to include all the important details without getting too bogged down in specifics. I'll start with his escape, then his criminal history, the background check failures, the consequences, and the resulting political and social debates. That should cover the main moral points the author emphasized.

SUMMARY: Devin Kelley, the gunman responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled history marked by domestic violence convictions, mental health issues, and behavioral problems. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, Kelley legally purchased firearms, as the Air Force failed to report his conviction to the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC), a lapse described as "appalling." His background, including multiple suspensions for misconduct as a student and domestic disputes, raised concerns about his mental stability and dangerous tendencies. The shooting, which killed 26 and injured 20, reignited debates over gun control and background check systems. The tragedy highlighted systemic failures in preventing individuals with violent histories from accessing firearms, sparking calls for legislative action to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns. END OF SUMMARY.
