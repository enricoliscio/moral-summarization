SUMMARY:

A former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled past. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. A police report revealed that Kelley had posed a "danger to himself and others" and had attempted to carry out death threats against his military commanders. Despite having a criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. The failure to transmit Kelley's record has been called an "appalling" lapse. The incident has sparked debate over gun ownership and background checks, with some lawmakers planning to introduce legislation to ensure that those convicted of domestic violence cannot legally purchase guns.
