SUMMARY: A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, escaping from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for criminal domestic violence charges. Police reports warned of his danger to self and others, with a history of sneaking firearms and death threats. Kelley's Air Force background included a conviction for assaulting his first wife and stepson, resulting in a bad-conduct discharge. Despite his criminal record, Kelley passed background checks and purchased guns, exposing a weak link in the system. School records revealed behavior problems and suspensions. His adult life was marked by divorce, remarriage, and domestic disputes, including threatening text messages to his mother-in-law. The massacre sparked debates on gun ownership and stricter reviews, with legislation aimed at blocking gun purchases for those convicted of domestic violence. The failure to transmit Kelley's conviction into the NCIC system was deemed appalling, leading to an inquest and an inspector general review. The FBI encountered difficulties accessing Kelley's cell phone for electronic evidence. The incident brought attention to the Second Amendment and the fabric of life in rural areas, with differing opinions on stricter gun laws.
