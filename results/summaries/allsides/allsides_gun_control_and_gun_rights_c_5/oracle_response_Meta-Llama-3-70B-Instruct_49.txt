SUMMARY: 

A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, who was convicted of domestic violence and had a history of behavior problems, committed the deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas. Kelley had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 after being caught sneaking firearms onto a U.S. Air Force base. He was apprehended without incident, but later went on to kill 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounded 20 others in a church in Sutherland Springs. Kelley, who had a criminal record, was able to purchase guns despite his conviction, due to a failure by the Air Force to enter his record into a government database. This lapse has been called "appalling" by a Republican congressman. Kelley's troubled past included assaulting his first wife and stepson, and sending threatening text messages to his mother-in-law. The massacre has reignited a debate over gun ownership and legislation aimed at blocking those convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns.
