SUMMARY:

The former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled past. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. He had been caught sneaking firearms onto a US Air Force base and had made death threats against his commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. This lapse is being investigated, and lawmakers are planning to introduce legislation to ensure that those convicted of domestic violence cannot legally purchase guns. The case highlights a weak link in the system of background checks and has reignited the debate over gun ownership. The tragedy has resulted in the loss of 26 lives, including an unborn child, and has left 20 others wounded.
