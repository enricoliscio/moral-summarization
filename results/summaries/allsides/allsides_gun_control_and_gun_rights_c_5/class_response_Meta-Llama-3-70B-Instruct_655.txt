SUMMARY:

Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had a troubled past, having escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges. He was later convicted and had a history of behavior problems, including drugs, insubordination, and profanity. Kelley's private life was marked by turbulence, including a domestic dispute with his in-laws, which may have motivated the attack. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice due to the Air Force's "appalling" failure to enter his conviction into a government database. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter reviews of gun purchases. President Trump believes stricter laws would not have prevented the attack.
