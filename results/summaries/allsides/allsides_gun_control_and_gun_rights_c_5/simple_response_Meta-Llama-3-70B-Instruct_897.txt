SUMMARY:

The former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled past. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. This lapse allowed Kelley to pass required criminal background checks. The shooting, which killed 26 people, including an unborn child, has sparked debate over gun ownership and background checks. Lawmakers are planning to introduce legislation to ensure that anyone convicted of domestic violence is blocked from legally purchasing a gun. The case has exposed a weak link in the system of background checks, highlighting the need for stricter reviews of gun purchases.
