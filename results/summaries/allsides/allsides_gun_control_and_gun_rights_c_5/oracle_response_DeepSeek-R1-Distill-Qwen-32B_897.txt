Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. He had a history of violence, mental disorders, and behavioral issues. The Air Force failed to report his conviction into a national database, allowing him to purchase guns legally. The shooting resulted in many deaths and injuries, and it sparked debates about gun control and background checks.

I need to highlight the moral elements: the violence, failures in the system, the consequences of not reporting his conviction, and the impact on the victims. I should use words like "mass shooting," "violence," "convicted," "threats," "killed," "wounded," "failure," "blocked," etc.

I'll structure the summary to include Kelley's background, his escape, the failed background checks, the shooting details, and the aftermath including the legislative response and the debate over gun control. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

I'll start by introducing Kelley and his actions, then move into his history and the system's failure, followed by the shooting's impact, and conclude with the implications and debates. I'll ensure that each sentence includes the morally framed words where appropriate without making it sound forced.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all key points and the specified words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

SUMMARY:  
Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 and wounding 20. Kelley, who escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence, had a history of violence, including assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, he passed background checks and legally purchased firearms. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a national database, allowing this to happen. Kelley’s troubled past included behavioral issues, suspensions for drugs, insubordination, and dishonesty. His attack on a church in Sutherland Springs reignited debates over gun control and background checks. Federal law prohibits domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns, but flaws in the system enabled Kelley’s purchases. Legislation is now proposed to block such individuals from buying firearms. The shooting, described as a lethal rampage, highlighted systemic failures and the need for stricter gun laws. END OF SUMMARY.
