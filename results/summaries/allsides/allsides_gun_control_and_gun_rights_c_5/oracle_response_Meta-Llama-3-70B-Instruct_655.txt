SUMMARY:

A former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, had a troubled past marked by violence and threats. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. Police reports revealed that Kelley posed a "danger to himself and others" and had been "caught sneaking firearms" onto a US Air Force base. He was apprehended without incident and later found guilty of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. On Sunday, Kelley opened fire on worshipers at a church, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. He was eventually killed by an armed civilian who tried to stop him. The incident has sparked calls for stricter gun laws and a review of the background check system to prevent similar tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
