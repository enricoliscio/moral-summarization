SUMMARY:
A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, committed the deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had a troubled past, having escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges. He was later convicted and had a criminal record that should have prevented him from buying guns. However, the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a government database, allowing him to pass background checks and purchase firearms. The "appalling" lapse has sparked calls for stricter gun laws and reviews of gun purchases. Kelley's private life was marked by turbulence, including domestic disputes and threatening behavior. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership and the need for stricter laws to prevent such lethal rampages. END OF SUMMARY.
