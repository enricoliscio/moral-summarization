Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it first. The article is about Devin Kelley, who carried out a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing charges for domestic violence. The police report says he was a danger, had mental disorders, and was caught with firearms. He was later apprehended without incident.

Kelley's background in the Air Force is problematic. He was court-martialed for domestic violence in 2012 but the Air Force didn't add his conviction to the NCIC database, which is used for background checks. Because of this, he was able to buy guns legally despite his criminal history. This led to the mass shooting where 26 were killed and 20 injured.

There's mention of legislative efforts to prevent domestic violence offenders from buying guns. The case highlights a flaw in the background check system. Kelley had behavior issues as a student and in his adult life, including threatening messages. The motive for the shooting isn't clear, and his phone is being analyzed.

The shooting reignited the gun control debate. Trump commented that stricter laws might not have prevented it, but could have stopped the man who shot Kelley.

So, the summary needs to include: Kelley's escape, his domestic violence conviction, the Air Force's failure to report it, the background check loophole, the mass shooting details, legislative response, his personal history, and the ongoing debate over gun control.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Devin Kelley, the former U.S. Air Force serviceman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing domestic violence charges. Police reports revealed he posed a danger, had mental disorders, and was caught sneaking firearms. He was later court-martialed for domestic violence but the Air Force failed to report his conviction to the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC), allowing him to legally purchase guns. This oversight contributed to the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, where 26 were killed and 20 injured. Kelley's troubled past included behavior problems and domestic disputes, though his motive for the attack remains unclear. The case has sparked legislative efforts to prevent domestic violence offenders from buying guns and highlighted flaws in the background check system. The shooting reignited the gun control debate, with President Trump opposing stricter laws. END OF SUMMARY.
