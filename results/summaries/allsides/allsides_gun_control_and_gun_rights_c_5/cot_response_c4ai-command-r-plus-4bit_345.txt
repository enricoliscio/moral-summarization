SUMMARY: Devin Kelley committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, and his past reveals a history of moral failures and a failure of the system to prevent further harm. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges. Police were advised that he posed a danger to himself and others, with a history of attempting to sneak firearms and suffering from mental disorders. Despite this, Kelley was later able to purchase guns due to an appalling lapse in the system where his criminal record was not entered into the required database. His conviction for assaulting his first wife and stepson should have prohibited him from legally purchasing firearms. This has brought attention to a weak link in background checks and the need for legislation to ensure those convicted of domestic violence cannot buy guns. Kelley's past also reveals numerous behavior problems, including suspensions for drugs, insubordination, profanity, skipping classes, and dishonesty. His adult life was embattled as well, with a divorce, a remarriage, and threatening disputes with his in-laws. The FBI is now working to access his cell phone for further investigation. The massacre has rekindled the debate over gun ownership and stricter reviews, with some arguing that stricter gun laws could have prevented the tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
