Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the key points and the words that carry moral implications.

The article talks about Devin Kelley, a former serviceman who committed a mass shooting. He had a history of domestic violence and mental issues, which are morally significant. He escaped a mental hospital and was able to buy guns despite his record because the Air Force didn't report his conviction. This is a failure in the system, which is a moral issue. The shooting resulted in many deaths, including an unborn child, which is tragic and morally impactful.

I should include words like "deadliest," "mass shooting," "escaped," "domestic violence," "mental disorders," "failed," "lapse," "blocked," "turmoil," "tragedy," and "Second Amendment" to maintain the moral framing. These words highlight the failures and the consequences, emphasizing the moral aspects.

Now, I'll structure the summary to cover Kelley's background, the system's failure, the shooting's impact, and the ongoing debate. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to convey the article's tone and message effectively.

**SUMMARY:**

Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, carried out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20. Kelley had a history of domestic violence and mental disorders, having escaped a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial. Despite his criminal record, he was able to purchase firearms due to a lapse in reporting his conviction to a government database. This failure allowed him to legally acquire guns, highlighting a weak link in the background check system. Kelleyâ€™s troubled past included behavior problems, multiple suspensions, and domestic disputes. His ability to buy guns despite his history has reignited debates over gun control and the Second Amendment. The tragedy underscores systemic failures and the need for stricter measures to prevent such violence. END OF SUMMARY.
