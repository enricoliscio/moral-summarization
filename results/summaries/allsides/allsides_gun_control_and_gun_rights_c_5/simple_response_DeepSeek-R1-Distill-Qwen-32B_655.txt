Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points and the underlying moral issues.

The article talks about Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing charges for domestic violence. The police report mentions that he was a danger to others, had mental disorders, and was carrying firearms. He was later apprehended but eventually carried out the mass shooting, killing 26 people, including an unborn child. 

The moral issues here include the failure of the Air Force to report his conviction into a national database, which allowed him to purchase guns legally despite his criminal history. This leads to a discussion about background checks and gun control. Additionally, the article mentions that the Air Force failed to enter his conviction, which is a lapse in their responsibility. There's also mention of proposed legislation to prevent domestic violence offenders from buying guns, and the ongoing debate about gun ownership in the U.S.

I need to ensure the summary captures these moral points: the system failure in reporting his conviction, the impact on the ability to purchase firearms, and the debate over gun laws. I should also mention the personal history of Devin Kelley, his behavior issues, and the tragic outcome of the shooting.

I'll structure the summary to start with the mass shooting, mention his escape and criminal history, the system failure, the consequences, and the resulting calls for legislation. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements without going into too much detail, but enough to convey the moral framing.

Kelley, who killed 26 people, including an unborn child, had escaped a mental hospital in 2012 while facing domestic violence charges. Despite his criminal history, he was able to legally purchase firearms due to the Air Force's failure to report his conviction to a national database. This lapse allowed him to buy guns, leading to the tragic event. The case has sparked calls for stricter background checks and legislation to prevent domestic violence offenders from purchasing firearms. The incident has reignited the debate over gun control in the U.S., emphasizing the need for systemic improvements to prevent future tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
