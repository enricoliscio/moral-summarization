SUMMARY: The Texas church shooting, perpetrated by Devin Kelley, was the deadliest in the state's history and one of the five most lethal in the United States. Kelley had a history of domestic violence, mental health issues, and behavioral problems, and was convicted by court-martial for assaulting his first wife and stepson while serving in the Air Force. Despite this, he was able to purchase guns due to a failure in the system, which has been called an "appalling" lapse. The shooting has rekindled debates over gun control, with legislators proposing stricter background checks and reviews of gun purchases to prevent such tragedies from occurring again. Kelley's troubled past, including his escape from a mental hospital and threats against his military commanders, highlight the urgent need for stricter gun control measures to ensure the safety of citizens.

END OF SUMMARY.
