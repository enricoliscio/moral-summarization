Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've given me specific steps to follow. First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I have to write a summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

Looking at the article, I see several words that carry moral implications. Words like "escaped," "court-martial," "domestic violence," "convicted," "posed," "danger," "sneaking," "firearms," "death threats," "mental disorders," "troubled," "background," "stormed," "massacre," "killed," "unborn child," "wounded," "critical," "failed," "inexplicably," "lapse," "legislation," "blocked," "turbulence," "conflict," "motive," "rekindled," "gun ownership," "protected," "stricter," "reviews," "prevented," "difference," "dead." These words highlight the moral issues involved, like violence, negligence, and legal failures.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, focusing on the key events and the moral aspects. I should mention Devin Kelley's background, his escape from the mental hospital, the failed background checks, the massacre, and the resulting debate on gun laws. I'll make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long.

I should start by introducing Kelley and his history, then move to the shooting, the aftermath, the system failures, and the political response. I'll end with the ongoing debate on gun ownership. Keeping it concise but informative, ensuring that the moral framing is clear throughout.

**SUMMARY:**  
Devin Kelley, the former U.S. serviceman responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled history marked by domestic violence, mental disorders, and behavioral issues. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, Kelley passed background checks and legally purchased firearms, exposing a flaw in the system. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a government database, allowing him to buy guns. Kelley’s violent past, including threatening his commanders and sending threatening messages, was well-documented. On Sunday, he stormed a church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Authorities found Kelley’s cellphone, but it remains inaccessible. His actions reignited debates over gun ownership and stricter reviews of gun purchases. END OF SUMMARY.
