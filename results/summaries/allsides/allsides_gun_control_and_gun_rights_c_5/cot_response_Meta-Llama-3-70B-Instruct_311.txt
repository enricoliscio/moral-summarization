SUMMARY:
A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, who had a troubled and violent past, committed the deadliest mass shooting on record in Texas, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 after being accused of domestic violence and had a history of behavior problems, including nine suspensions in school. Despite being convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson, Kelley was able to purchase guns due to an appalling lapse by the Air Force, which failed to enter his conviction into a government database. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership, with some calling for stricter reviews of gun purchases. However, President Trump believes that stricter gun laws would not have stopped the rampage. END OF SUMMARY.
