SUMMARY: A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, escaping from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges. Police warned of his danger, noting his attempts to sneak firearms and carry out death threats. Kelley was convicted, but the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the background check system, allowing him to purchase guns despite his criminal record. This appalling lapse exposed a weak link in the system. Kelley's troubled past included behavior problems and a turbulent adult life marked by divorce and disputes. His rampage in a Texas church left 26 dead, including an unborn child, and raised debates about gun ownership and stricter gun laws.
END OF SUMMARY.
