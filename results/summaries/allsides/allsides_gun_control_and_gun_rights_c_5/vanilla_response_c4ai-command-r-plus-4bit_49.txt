SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was committed by Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a history of mental health issues and domestic violence. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted. He was also found to have brought firearms onto a U.S. Air Force base. Kelley stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. He later killed himself during a failed getaway attempt. The Air Force failed to enter Kelley's conviction into a government database used for screening gun buyers, allowing him to purchase firearms despite his criminal record. The case has brought attention to gaps in the system of background checks for gun purchases. Kelley's private life was marked by turbulence, including a history of domestic violence and threatening behavior. Authorities are investigating the role of a domestic dispute with his in-laws in motivating the shooting. The massacre has reignited debates over gun control in the U.S., with some calling for stricter background checks and laws to prevent domestic abusers from accessing firearms.
END OF SUMMARY.
