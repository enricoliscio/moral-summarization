SUMMARY:
A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, who had a troubled past, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. Despite his criminal record, he was able to purchase guns due to an "appalling" lapse by the Air Force, which failed to enter his conviction into a government database. Kelley's behavior problems and turbulence in his personal life, including a history of assault and threatening behavior, raise questions about how he was able to obtain firearms. The tragedy has sparked a renewed debate over gun ownership and background checks, with some lawmakers calling for stricter laws to prevent such tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
