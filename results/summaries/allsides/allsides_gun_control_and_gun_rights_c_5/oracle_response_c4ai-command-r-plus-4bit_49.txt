SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history has brought to light a series of alarming facts about the shooter, Devin Kelley, and the failures that allowed him to legally purchase firearms despite his violent past. Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges and was later convicted. Police reports described him as a danger to himself and others, and he had attempted to carry out death threats against his military commanders. Despite this, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to an inexplicable failure by the Air Force to enter his conviction into a national criminal database. This appalling lapse has prompted calls for legislation to block anyone convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns. Kelley's troubled past also included behavior problems as a student, a history of drug use, insubordination, and dishonesty. The shooting, which left 26 people dead, including an unborn child, and 20 wounded, has once again sparked debates about gun control and the need for stricter reviews of gun purchases.
