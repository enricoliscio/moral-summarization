SUMMARY:

The former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, had a troubled past. In 2012, he escaped from a mental hospital while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges, and was later convicted. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year, due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. This lapse allowed Kelley to pass required criminal background checks. The shooting, which killed 26 people, including an unborn child, has reignited the debate over gun ownership and background checks. Lawmakers are now planning to introduce legislation to ensure that those convicted of domestic violence are blocked from legally purchasing guns. The case has exposed a weak link in the system of background checks, and has raised questions about the role of gun ownership in preventing such tragedies.
