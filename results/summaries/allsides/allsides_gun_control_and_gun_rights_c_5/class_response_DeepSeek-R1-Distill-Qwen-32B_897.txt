Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I should include. Let me read through the article again to pick out the key points.

The article is about Devin Kelley, a former serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. Police reports mentioned he was a danger, had mental disorders, and was caught sneaking firearms. He was later apprehended without incident.

Kelley's background was troubled; he had behavior issues in school, multiple suspensions, and after his military service, he had domestic disputes. He bought guns despite having a criminal record because the Air Force didn't report his conviction to the NCIC system. This failure allowed him to pass background checks.

The shooting was the deadliest in Texas, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20. He killed himself after being wounded. The article also mentions legislative efforts to prevent such purchases and the ongoing debate about gun laws.

I need to include words like "deadliest," "shooting," "violence," "charges," "sneaking," "threats," "killed," "massacre," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral failings, like the system's failure to report his conviction and the consequences of that lapse.

I'll start by mentioning the deadliest shooting, then his escape, the police warnings, his background, the system failure, the consequences, and the legislative response. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key moral points.

Let me draft it:

Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 and wounding 20. He had escaped a mental hospital in 2012, facing domestic violence charges, and police warned he was dangerous. His military background showed behavior issues and a conviction for assaulting his wife and stepson, which wasn't reported to the NCIC, allowing him to buy guns. The Air Force's failure to report his conviction was called an "appalling" lapse. Kelley's troubled past included drug use, insubordination, and threatening messages. The shooting reignited debates on gun control and background checks. Legislators plan to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns. The case highlights systemic failures and the tragic consequences of unchecked violence.

That should cover all the key moral points and include the required words.

SUMMARY:  
Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people and wounding 20. He had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges, with police warning he posed a "danger to himself and others" after being caught sneaking firearms. Kelley's troubled background included a 2012 conviction for assaulting his wife and stepson, which was inexplicably not reported to the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC), allowing him to pass background checks and purchase guns. His failure to report was called an "appalling" lapse by officials. Kelley's history also included behavior problems, drug use, insubordination, and sending threatening messages. The massacre reignited debates over gun control and background checks, with legislators proposing stricter laws to prevent domestic violence offenders from purchasing firearms.
