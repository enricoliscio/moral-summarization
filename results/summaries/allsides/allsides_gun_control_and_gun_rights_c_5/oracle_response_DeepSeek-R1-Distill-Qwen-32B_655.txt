Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. The main subject is Devin Kelley, a former serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He had a history of domestic violence, escaped from a mental hospital, and was involved in a failed getaway. There's also mention of background check failures and the impact on the community.

I should start by mentioning the shooting and the number of casualties. Then, touch on his past, including the court-martial, escape, and mental issues. Highlighting the failure to report his conviction is crucial for the moral aspect. Also, mention the legislative response and the debate over gun laws.

I need to use words like "violence," "convicted," "threats," "killed," "dead," "wounded," "failure," "legislation," etc. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the event, then his background, the system failure, and the aftermath.

I should keep each sentence concise to stay within 200 words. Let me draft a few sentences, ensuring each key point is covered with the moral terms. Maybe start with the shooting, then his history, the background check failure, the legislative action, and the debate over gun laws.

I need to avoid any technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that the moral implications are evident through the chosen words. Let me piece it together, checking word count as I go. Once done, I'll review to make sure all important points are included and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: A former U.S. serviceman, Devin Kelley, carried out the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people and wounding 20 at a church in Sutherland Springs. Kelley, who had a history of violence, including a 2012 court-martial conviction for assaulting his first wife and stepson, had escaped from a mental hospital and was flagged as a danger to others. Despite his criminal record, he legally purchased firearms, as the Air Force failed to report his conviction to the National Criminal Information Center. Kelleyâ€™s troubled past included behavior problems, drug use, insubordination, and threatening text messages. His attack reignited debates over gun control and background checks. Federal officials acknowledged the failure to report his record as an "appalling lapse," and legislation was proposed to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns. Kelley, who killed himself during a failed getaway, exposed weaknesses in the system designed to prevent such violence. END OF SUMMARY.
