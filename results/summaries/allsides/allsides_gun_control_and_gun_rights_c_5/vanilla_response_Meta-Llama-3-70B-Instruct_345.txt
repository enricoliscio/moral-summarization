SUMMARY:

A police report revealed that Devin Kelley, the former US serviceman who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges. He was later convicted and had a troubled Air Force background. Kelley stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. He killed himself after being wounded by an armed civilian. Despite having a criminal record, Kelley passed two background checks and purchased guns. The Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a government database, allowing him to buy guns legally. The incident has sparked an investigation and calls for stricter gun laws. Two senators plan to co-sponsor legislation to block domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns. The case has exposed a weak link in the system of background checks.
