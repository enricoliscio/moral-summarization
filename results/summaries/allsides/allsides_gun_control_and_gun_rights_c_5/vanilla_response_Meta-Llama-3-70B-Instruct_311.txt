SUMMARY:

A police report revealed that Devin Kelley, the former US serviceman who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges. Kelley, who was later convicted, posed a "danger to himself and others" and had been "attempting to carry out death threats" against his military commanders. He was apprehended without incident at a bus station. Kelley's troubled Air Force background has been a focus of investigators after he stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Despite having a criminal record, Kelley twice passed a required criminal background check when buying guns. The Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a government database, allowing him to purchase firearms. The incident has sparked an ongoing debate over gun ownership and background checks.
