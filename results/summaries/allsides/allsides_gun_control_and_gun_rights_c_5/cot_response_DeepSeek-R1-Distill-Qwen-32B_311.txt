Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. The police report mentions that he was a danger to others, had mental disorders, and was caught sneaking firearms. He was later apprehended without incident. 

Kelley's background in the Air Force was troubled, and he had a history of domestic violence. He was convicted by court-martial in 2012 but the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a government database, which led to him purchasing guns legally despite his criminal record. This failure was called an "appalling" lapse by a congressman. 

The article also mentions that Kelley had behavior problems in school, including suspensions, and had domestic disputes with his in-laws. The shooting reignited debates about gun ownership and background checks. President Trump commented that stricter laws might not have prevented the shooting but could have stopped the man who shot Kelley.

For the summary, I need to include the morally framed words identified earlier. I'll structure the summary to highlight Kelley's background, the system failures, and the consequences, ensuring the moral elements are preserved.
