SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history has brought to light a series of alarming facts about the shooter, Devin Kelley, and the failures that allowed him to legally purchase firearms despite his history of violence and mental health issues. Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing domestic violence charges, during which time he was caught sneaking firearms onto his base and attempting to carry out death threats. Despite being convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson, Kelley was able to purchase guns due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into the necessary database. This has been called an "appalling" lapse, and legislators are now working to ensure that domestic violence convictions, whether military or civilian, result in a prohibition from purchasing guns. Kelley's violent behavior was also evident during his school years, where he was suspended multiple times for drugs, insubordination, and dishonesty. The massacre, which left 26 people dead and 20 wounded, has once again sparked debates about gun control and the need for stricter reviews of gun purchases.

END OF SUMMARY.
