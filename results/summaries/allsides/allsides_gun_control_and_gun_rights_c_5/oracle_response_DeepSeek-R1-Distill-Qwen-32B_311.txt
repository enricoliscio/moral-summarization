Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to identify the key points and ensure I include those words.

The article is about Devin Kelley, a former Air Force serviceman, who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. Police reports mentioned he was a danger, had mental disorders, and was caught with firearms. He was later apprehended without incident.

Kelley's background includes multiple suspensions for bad behavior, including drugs and insubordination. He was convicted of assaulting his wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, he passed background checks and bought guns. The Air Force failed to enter his conviction into the NCIC system, which is a lapse that allowed him to purchase firearms legally.

The shooting resulted in 26 deaths, including an unborn child, and 20 wounded. Kelley killed himself after being wounded. Senators plan legislation to block domestic violence offenders from buying guns. The case highlights weaknesses in background checks and reignites the gun control debate.

I need to make sure I include words like "shooting," "violence," "convicted," "sneaking," "threats," etc. I should structure the summary to cover his background, the escape, the failed background checks, the consequences of the shooting, and the policy response.

I should also keep the summary under 200 words. Let me outline the key points:

1. Devin Kelley's background: former Air Force, escaped mental hospital, domestic violence conviction.
2. His dangerous behavior: sneaking firearms, threats, mental disorders.
3. Apprehended but later bought guns despite record.
4. Air Force failure to report conviction.
5. The shooting: 26 dead, 20 wounded.
6. Kelley's troubled past: suspensions, drugs, insubordination.
7. Policy response: legislation to block domestic violence offenders from buying guns.
8. Weakness in background checks and debate over gun control.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep it concise.
