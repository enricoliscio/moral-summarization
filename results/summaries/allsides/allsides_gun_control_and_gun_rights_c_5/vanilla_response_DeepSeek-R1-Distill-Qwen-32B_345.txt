Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. Police reports mention he was dangerous, had mental disorders, and was carrying firearms. He was caught in Texas after escaping.

Kelley had a troubled past in the Air Force, with convictions for domestic violence. The Air Force failed to report his conviction to a national database, which allowed him to buy guns legally. This oversight is being investigated. He killed 26 people in a church, including an unborn child, and wounded 20. He died in a shootout.

The article also talks about his history of behavior problems in school and domestic issues. The shooting reignited debates about gun control. Trump commented that stricter laws might not have prevented the shooting but could have stopped the man who shot Kelley.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Kelley's escape, his criminal history, the Air Force's failure, the shooting details, and the implications for gun laws. I'll make sure to mention the consequences and the ongoing debate. Let me structure this clearly and concisely.
