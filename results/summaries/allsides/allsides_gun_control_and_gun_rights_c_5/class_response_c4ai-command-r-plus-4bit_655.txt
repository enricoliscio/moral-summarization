SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history has brought to light the troubled past of the gunman, Devin Kelley. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges, during which he was found to be a danger to himself and others for sneaking firearms and carrying out death threats. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns in the past year due to a failure by the Air Force to enter his conviction into a national criminal database. This lapse has been called "appalling" and has sparked discussions for legislation to ensure those convicted of domestic violence cannot legally purchase guns. Kelley's past also revealed behavior problems in school and a history of drug use, insubordination, profanity, skipping classes, and dishonesty. The massacre, which left 26 people dead, including an unborn child, has rekindled debates about gun ownership and stricter reviews of gun purchases.
