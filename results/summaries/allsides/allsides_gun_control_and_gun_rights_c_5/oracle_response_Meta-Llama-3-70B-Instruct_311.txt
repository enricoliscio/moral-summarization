SUMMARY:

A former US serviceman, Devin Kelley, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, killing 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounding 20 others. Kelley had a troubled past, having escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial on domestic violence charges, for which he was later convicted. He had also been caught sneaking firearms onto a US Air Force base and had made death threats against his military commanders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns twice in the past year due to the Air Force's failure to enter his conviction into a government database. This "appalling" lapse has sparked calls for legislation to ensure that those convicted of domestic violence are blocked from legally purchasing guns. Kelley's behavior problems as a student and turbulent adult life, including a domestic dispute with his in-laws, have also come to light. The massacre has reignited the debate over gun ownership and the need for stricter reviews of gun purchases. END OF SUMMARY.
