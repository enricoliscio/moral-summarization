SUMMARY: Devin Kelley, the former U.S. serviceman who committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, had a history of mental health issues, domestic violence, and threatening behavior. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted of assaulting his first wife and stepson. Despite his criminal record, Kelley was able to purchase guns due to a failure by the Air Force to enter his conviction into a national database. This "appalling" lapse has sparked calls for legislation to block domestic violence offenders from legally purchasing guns. Kelley's private life was marked by turbulence, including a dispute with his in-laws that may have been a motivating factor in the shooting. Kelley killed 26 people, including an unborn child, and wounded 20 others before taking his own life. His cell phone is being examined by the FBI, but they have not yet accessed the device. The massacre has reignited debates over gun control, with some arguing that stricter background checks could have prevented the tragedy.
END OF SUMMARY.
