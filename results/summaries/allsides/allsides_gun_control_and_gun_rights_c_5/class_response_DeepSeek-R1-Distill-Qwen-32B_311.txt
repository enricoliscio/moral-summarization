Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I should include as many of those as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and follow the specified format.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main subject is Devin Kelley, a former serviceman who committed a mass shooting in Texas. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence. Police knew he was dangerous but didn't enter his conviction into a database, allowing him to buy guns later. The shooting was deadly, with 26 killed and 20 wounded. The article also discusses the broader issues of gun control and background checks.

Now, I'll identify the morally framed words from the list that are relevant. Words like "deadliest," "shooting," "violence," "charges," "sneaking," "carry," "threats," "run," "fire," "killed," "assault," "wounded," "convicted," "failed," "prohibits," "appalling," "lapse," "massacre," "rampage," "prevented," "shot," "dead."

I need to structure the summary to include these words while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the deadliest shooting, then Kelley's background, the escape, the police failure, the gun purchases, the attack details, and the aftermath including the debate on gun control.

I'll make sure each sentence incorporates as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. For example, using "deadliest mass shooting" and "domestic violence charges" early on sets the moral tone. Mentioning the "failed" entry into the database highlights the systemic failure, which is a moral issue.

I also need to mention the consequences, like the number of people killed and wounded, and the legislative response. Ending with the debate over gun laws ties back to the moral framing of preventing future violence.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise and flows naturally, preserving the moral aspects the author emphasized.

SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history occurred when Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, attacked a church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 and wounding 20. Kelley, who had a history of violence, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial for domestic violence charges. Police were aware he posed a danger, as he had been caught sneaking firearms and attempting to carry out death threats. Despite his conviction for assaulting his first wife and stepson, the Air Force failed to enter his record into a government database, allowing him to legally purchase firearms. This lapse was described as "appalling." Kelleyâ€™s troubled past included behavior problems, drug use, insubordination, and threatening text messages. The attack reignited debates over gun ownership and background checks, with lawmakers proposing legislation to prevent domestic violence offenders from purchasing guns. The massacre, one of the deadliest in U.S. history, highlighted systemic failures in preventing such violence. END OF SUMMARY.
