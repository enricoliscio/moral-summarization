SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, which left 26 people dead, including an unborn child, has brought to light several alarming facts about the shooter, Devin Kelley. Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman, had a history of domestic violence, mental health issues, and firearm-related infractions. He escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges for assaulting his first wife and stepson, and was later convicted and dishonorably discharged from the Air Force. Disturbingly, Kelley was able to purchase guns despite his criminal record due to a failure by the Air Force to enter his conviction into a national database. This "appalling" lapse has prompted investigations and calls for legislative action to ensure that domestic violence convictions, whether in civilian or military court, result in a prohibition from legally purchasing firearms. Kelley's troubled past also included numerous behavior problems during his school years, threats against his military commanders, and a history of drug use. The shooting has sparked a familiar debate about gun control and the prevention of such massacres in the future.
END OF SUMMARY.
