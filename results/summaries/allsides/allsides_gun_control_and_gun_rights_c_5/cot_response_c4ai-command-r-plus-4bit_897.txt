SUMMARY: Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a troubled past, committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, escaping from a mental hospital and later being convicted of domestic violence charges. Police reports revealed his danger to himself and others, including death threats and mental disorders. Despite his criminal record, Kelley passed background checks and purchased guns, exposing a weak link in the system. Kelley's history of behavior problems and troubled private life, including divorce and disputes, may have contributed to his motivation for the shooting. The tragedy has sparked debates about gun ownership and stricter reviews of gun purchases, with some arguing that stricter laws could have prevented the rampage and saved hundreds of lives. Lawmakers are sponsoring legislation to block those convicted of domestic violence from legally purchasing guns. END OF SUMMARY.
