SUMMARY: The deadliest mass shooting in Texas history was committed by Devin Kelley, a former U.S. serviceman with a history of mental health issues and domestic violence. Kelley escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 while facing court-martial charges and was later convicted. The Air Force failed to enter his conviction into a national database, allowing him to pass background checks and purchase guns despite his criminal record. Kelley's troubled background, including behavior problems as a student and a history of domestic disputes, has come under scrutiny following the shooting. The massacre has rekindled debates over gun control and the Second Amendment. Two senators plan to co-sponsor legislation aimed at blocking gun purchases for anyone convicted of domestic violence, whether in civilian or military court. Despite the tragedy, President Trump believes stricter gun laws would not have prevented the rampage.
