SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during the protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr stated that the Justice Department is working to restore order and that there are three distinct groups present at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators who are to blame for the violence. He condemned the senseless acts of anarchy and arson, looting, assaults, and murder, stating that these are not exercises of First Amendment rights but crimes that terrorize communities. Barr acknowledged the concerns of protesters about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, pledging to find constructive solutions while also condemning the violent and destructive actions of some. He also addressed criticisms of President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, stating that he saw it as appropriate and not a political act.

Barr emphasized the need to distinguish between peaceful protesters and those engaging in violent and destructive behavior, while also recognizing the legitimate concerns of protesters about injustices in the system.
