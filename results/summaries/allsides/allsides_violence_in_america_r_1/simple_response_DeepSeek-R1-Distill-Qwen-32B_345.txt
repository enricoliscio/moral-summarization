Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, the article is about Attorney General William Barr discussing arrests related to the protests over George Floyd's death. I need to make sure the summary captures the key points and the moral perspective presented.

First, I should identify the main elements: 51 arrests, the types of crimes, the three groups involved, Barr's comments on Antifa and foreign actors, his stance on police and justice, and the mention of Trump's church visit. 

I need to highlight that Barr is emphasizing the distinction between peaceful protests and violent acts, framing the latter as crimes. Also, his mention of Antifa and foreign interference adds a layer of external influence on the violence. 

I should also include his acknowledgment of issues in the criminal justice system and his commitment to finding solutions. The part about Trump's visit is a bit of a side note but shows the administration's perspective on the situation.

I have to keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Make sure to mention the three groups, the crimes, the arrests, and the moral stance against violence while supporting the right to protest. Also, note the call for reform in the justice system.

Let me structure it: start with the arrests and the context of Floyd's death, then describe the groups, mention the crimes, touch on the Antifa and foreign actors, then his stance on police and justice reform, and briefly mention the church visit. Keep it balanced but reflect the moral framing against violence and support for peaceful protest.

I think that covers all the necessary points without getting too detailed. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and concise.

Barr acknowledged systemic issues in the criminal justice system and planned to address police misconduct and community trust. He also defended President Trump's visit to St. Johnâ€™s Church, calling it appropriate and not political. Barr stressed the need for reform to ensure equal justice, while federal agencies work to restore order. END OF SUMMARY.
