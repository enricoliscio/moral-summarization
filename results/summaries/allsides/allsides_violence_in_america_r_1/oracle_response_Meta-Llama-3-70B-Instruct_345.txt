SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "crimes designed to terrify fellow citizens and intimidate communities," including arson, looting, assaults, and murder. He emphasized that these actions are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather "hijacked" protests by extremists and foreign actors seeking to exploit the situation. Barr acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, promising to work towards "constructive solutions." He also defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, calling it "entirely appropriate" and not a "political act." Barr reiterated the need to "restore order" and "quell outbreaks of violence," ensuring that the "vast majority of police officers" do their job "bravely and righteously." END OF SUMMARY.
