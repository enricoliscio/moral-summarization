SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr stated that the Justice Department and other federal agencies are working to restore order and have deployed resources to quell outbreaks of violence. He condemned the violent acts, saying they are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather crimes designed to terrify citizens and intimidate communities. Barr identified three sets of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have hijacked the protests. He stated that there is evidence that Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors, are involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity. Barr also addressed concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, saying that he will meet with community leaders to find constructive solutions.
