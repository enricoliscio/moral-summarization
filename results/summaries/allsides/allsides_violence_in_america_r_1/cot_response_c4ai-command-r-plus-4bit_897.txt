SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced 51 arrests for federal crimes related to the violent rioting that has taken place during protests over the murder of George Floyd. Barr emphasized the distinction between peaceful protesters and those who engage in lawlessness, including looting, arson, and assaults. He attributed the violent activity to extremist agitators, such as Antifa, and foreign actors with varying political persuasions. Barr acknowledged the legitimate concerns of protesters regarding police misconduct and injustices within the criminal justice system, pledging to find constructive solutions. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, stating it was appropriate for the president to walk to the church of presidents and not a political act. The attorney general reiterated the need for equal protection under the law and the importance of restoring order while respecting the First Amendment rights of peaceful protesters. END OF SUMMARY.
