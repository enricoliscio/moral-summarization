SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced 51 arrests for federal crimes related to violent rioting during the protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr differentiated between peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators exploiting the situation. He acknowledged the legitimate concerns of protesters about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, pledging to find solutions. Barr condemned the violent rioting, arson, looting, and assaults as crimes designed to terrify citizens and intimidate communities. He stated that these actions are not exercises of First Amendment rights. Evidence points to extremist groups like Antifa and foreign actors as instigators of the violence. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church as appropriate, denying it was a political act and affirming the President's right to do so. Barr emphasized the need for equal protection under the law for all Americans, acknowledging the lack of confidence many African Americans have in the criminal justice system.
