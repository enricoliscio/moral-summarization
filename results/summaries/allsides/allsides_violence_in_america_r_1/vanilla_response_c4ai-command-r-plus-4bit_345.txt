SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced 51 arrests related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr differentiated between peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators exploiting the demonstrations, blaming the latter group for the violence. He acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices within the criminal justice system, pledging to work towards constructive solutions. Barr also addressed criticisms of President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, calling it appropriate and not a political act. He emphasized the right of the president to walk to the church, unrelated to the decision to expand the security perimeter.

Barr stated that the Justice Department is working tirelessly with other agencies to restore order and that resources have been deployed to address outbreaks of violence. He mentioned evidence of Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors, being involved in the violent activity.

Barr expressed support for the majority of police officers while acknowledging the need for change to address the lack of confidence among African Americans in the criminal justice system. He emphasized the mandate for equal protection under the law.
