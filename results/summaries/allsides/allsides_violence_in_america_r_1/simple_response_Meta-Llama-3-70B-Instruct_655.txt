SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "lawlessness" that have occurred, including violent rioting, arson, looting, and assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people. He emphasized that these actions are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather crimes designed to terrorize and intimidate communities. Barr identified three groups involved in the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have hijacked the protests to pursue their own agendas. He acknowledged that there is evidence that Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors, have been involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity. Barr also addressed concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, emphasizing the need for equal protection of the laws.
