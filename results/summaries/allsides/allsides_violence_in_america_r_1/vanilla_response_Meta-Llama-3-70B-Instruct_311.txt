SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr stated that the Justice Department and other federal agencies are working to restore order and have deployed resources to quell outbreaks of violence. He condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and noted that there are three sets of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators who have "hijacked" the protests. Barr said there is evidence that Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors, are involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity. He also addressed concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, saying that he will meet with community leaders to find solutions. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, saying it was "entirely appropriate" and not a political act.
