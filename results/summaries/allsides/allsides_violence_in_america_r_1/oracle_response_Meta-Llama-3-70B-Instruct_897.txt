SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "crimes designed to terrify fellow citizens and intimidate communities" that have hijacked peaceful protests. He identified three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators who have instigated and participated in violent activity. Barr stated that evidence points to Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors, exacerbating the violence. He acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, promising to meet with community leaders to find constructive solutions. Barr emphasized that the vast majority of police officers do their job bravely and righteously, but it is undeniable that many African Americans lack confidence in the system. He reiterated that the Constitution mandates equal protection of the laws, and nothing less is acceptable. END OF SUMMARY.
