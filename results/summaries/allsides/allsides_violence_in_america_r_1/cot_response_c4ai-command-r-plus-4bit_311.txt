SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced 51 arrests for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr emphasized the need to restore order and quelling outbreaks of violence, condemning senseless acts of anarchy that are designed to terrify and intimidate communities. The death of Floyd, a black man, at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has triggered widespread outrage, protests, and riots. Barr distinguished between peaceful protesters exercising their rights and extremist agitators blamed for violent activity. He acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices, vowing to find constructive solutions to build confidence in the criminal justice system and ensure equal protection for all. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church as appropriate and unrelated to the clearing of protesters, refuting claims of it being a political act. END OF SUMMARY.
