Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Attorney General William Barr discussing the 51 arrests made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during the protests over George Floyd's death. He mentions that while many protested peacefully, others engaged in violent acts like arson, looting, and assaulting law enforcement. He identifies three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists, particularly Antifa, who he blames for instigating violence. Barr also addresses police misconduct and the need for reform, emphasizing constitutional protection and equal justice. He defends the President's visit to the church as appropriate, not political.

Now, I need to extract the key points and use the moral words. The main elements are the arrests, the violent acts, the groups involved, the blame on extremists, the call for justice, and the political context. I should ensure that words like crimes, rioting, violence, hijacked, etc., are included.

I'll start by stating the arrests, mention the violent acts, the groups, and the blame on Antifa. Then, address the need for justice and the political aspect with the President's visit. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft this, making sure to include as many moral terms as possible without making it too long. I should also maintain the structure: arrests, violent acts, groups, blame, justice, and political context.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.
