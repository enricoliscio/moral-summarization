Alright, I need to tackle this query. The user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about Attorney General William Barr discussing arrests related to violent protests following George Floyd's death. He mentions 51 arrests, talks about lawlessness, anarchy, and crimes like rioting, arson, looting, assaults, and murder. He distinguishes between peaceful protesters and those hijacking the protests, blaming extremist groups like Antifa and foreign actors. He also addresses police misconduct and the need for constitutional equality.

Okay, for step one, I need to extract all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong moral or ethical connotation. Let me go through each sentence.

"Violent rioting" – violent is a moral term. "Federal crimes" – crime is moral. "Hijacked protests" – hijacked implies wrong action. "Lawlessness" is clearly moral. "Anarchy" is another. "Crimes" again. "Terrify" is a strong emotion but maybe not purely moral. "Innocent people" – innocent is moral. "Murder" is a crime, so moral. "Senseless acts" – senseless implies without reason, but maybe not purely moral. "Anarchy" again. "First Amendment rights" – rights are moral. "Extremist agitators" – extremist is moral. "Hijacked" again. "Violent activity" – violent. "Antifa" is a group, not a word. "Extremist groups" – extremist. "Political persuasions" – political, but not moral. "Foreign actors" – not moral. "Exacerbate" – not moral. "Peaceful protesters" – peaceful. "Law enforcement" – not moral. "Police misconduct" – misconduct is moral. "Injustices" – injustice is moral. "Equal protection" – constitutional right, so moral. "Nothing less acceptable" – implies a standard, so moral. "Expand perimeter" – not moral. "Political act" – not moral. "Executive branch" – not moral. "Church of presidents" – not moral.

Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me go through again. Words like "outrage," "arrested," "charged," "murder," "looting," "assaults," "extremist," "agitators," "hijacked," "anarchy," "senseless," "crimes," "terrify," "innocent," "murder," "extremist," "foreign," "exacerbate," "peaceful," "protesters," "police," "misconduct," "injustices," "equal protection," "constitutional," "nothing less acceptable," "expand," "perimeter," "correlation," "decision," "appropriate," "executive," "church," "presidents," "political act."

Wait, maybe "outrage" is a moral term. "Arrested" is legal, not moral. "Charged" is legal. "Murder" is a crime, so moral. "Looting" is a crime, so moral. "Assaults" is crime. "Extremist" is a label with moral connotations. "Agitators" implies someone causing trouble, so moral. "Hijacked" implies stealing the purpose, so moral. "Anarchy" is a state of disorder, which is moral. "Senseless" implies without reason, but maybe not purely moral. "Crimes" are moral. "Terrify" is an emotion, but in context, it's about causing fear, which is a moral action. "Innocent" is moral. "Murder" again. "Extremist" again. "Foreign" is neutral. "Exacerbate" is about worsening, but not moral. "Peaceful" is moral. "Protesters" neutral. "Police" neutral. "Misconduct" is moral. "Injustices" is moral. "Equal protection" is a constitutional right, so moral. "Nothing less acceptable" implies a standard, so moral. "Expand," "perimeter" – neutral. "Correlation" – neutral. "Decision" – neutral. "Appropriate" – moral. "Executive" – neutral. "Church" – neutral. "Presidents" – neutral. "Political act" – neutral.

So compiling all the morally framed words:

Violent, crimes, hijacked, lawlessness, anarchy, senseless, innocent, murder, extremist, agitators, exacerbate, peaceful, misconduct, injustices, equal, appropriate.

Wait, "exacerbate" might not be moral, it's more about worsening. "Peaceful" is moral. "Misconduct" is moral. "Injustices" is moral. "Equal" is moral. "Appropriate" is moral.

So the list would be:

Violent, crimes, hijacked, lawlessness, anarchy, senseless, innocent, murder, extremist, agitators, peaceful, misconduct, injustices, equal, appropriate.

I think that's all. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while concisely summarizing the article. The summary should highlight Barr's statements about arrests, the分类 of protesters, the blame on extremists, and the call for justice.

I should start by mentioning the 51 arrests, then the分类 into peaceful, looters, and extremists. Mention Antifa and foreign actors. Then touch on police misconduct and the need for equal justice. Also, briefly mention Trump's church visit and Barr's response.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft that.

Attorney General William Barr reported 51 federal arrests linked to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. He highlighted three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators, blaming the latter for much of the violence, including arson, looting, and assault. Barr emphasized that such lawlessness is not protected speech but criminal acts. He also addressed police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, calling for equal protection under the law. Additionally, he dismissed criticism of President Trump's visit to a nearby church, deeming it an appropriate action.

That should cover the key points and include the moral terms.
