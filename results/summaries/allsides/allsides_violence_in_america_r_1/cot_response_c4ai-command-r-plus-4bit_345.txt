SUMMARY: 
Attorney General William Barr announced 51 arrests for federal crimes related to the violent rioting and protests following the death of George Floyd. Barr emphasized the distinction between peaceful protesters and those engaging in lawlessness, including rioting, looting, and assaults. He attributed the violence to extremist groups with their own agendas and foreign actors seeking to exacerbate tensions. Barr acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices within the criminal justice system, particularly regarding the lack of confidence among African Americans. He affirmed the need for equal protection under the law and promised to seek constructive solutions. During the press conference, Barr also addressed criticisms of President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, stating his decision to expand the security perimeter was unrelated and defending the president's actions as appropriate and non-political. Barr reiterated the right of the president to walk outside the White House and visit the church.
