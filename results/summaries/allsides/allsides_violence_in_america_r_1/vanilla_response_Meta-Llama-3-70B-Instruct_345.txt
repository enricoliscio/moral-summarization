SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr stated that the Justice Department and other federal agencies are working to restore order and have deployed resources to quell outbreaks of violence. He condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and noted that evidence suggests extremist groups, including Antifa, and foreign actors are instigating and participating in violent activity. Barr acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, promising to meet with community leaders to find solutions. He also addressed criticisms over President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, saying his decision to expand the perimeter had no correlation with the President's visit and that the President's actions were "entirely appropriate".
