Okay, so I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed news article about Attorney General William Barr's statements regarding the arrests related to the protests over George Floyd's death. 

The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible, keeping it under 200 words. 

First, I'll go through the article to pick out the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. For example, words like "violent," "anarchy," "looting," "senseless," "exploit," "agitate," "extremist," "foreign," "injustices," "equal," "righteous," "confidence," "appropriate," and "political." These words are used to convey the moral stance of the article, highlighting the negative actions of some protesters and the positive actions of law enforcement and the attorney general.

Next, I need to craft a summary that includes these words. I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and accurately reflects the original content while emphasizing the moral aspects. I'll start by mentioning the 51 arrests and the context of the protests. Then, I'll include Barr's identification of the different groups involved, the negative actions like rioting, arson, and looting, and the groups responsible, such as Antifa and foreign actors. I'll also touch on Barr's commitment to addressing systemic issues and his stance on the president's visit, using terms like "appropriate" and "political act."

I need to make sure the summary flows well and doesn't just list the words but integrates them naturally. I should also keep the focus on the moral framing, showing the contrast between the peaceful protesters and those engaging in violent acts, as well as the efforts to address systemic issues in the criminal justice system.

Let me structure this step by step. First, introduce the arrests and the context. Then, describe the groups and their actions. Next, mention the involvement of extremist and foreign groups. After that, address the systemic issues and the attorney general's plans. Finally, touch on the president's visit and the moral justification behind it. 

I should avoid adding any new information not present in the article and ensure that the summary stays within the word limit. I'll also check that all the identified morally framed words are included where appropriate without forcing them in. 

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll put it all together into a coherent summary that meets the user's requirements.

**SUMMARY:**

Attorney General William Barr reported 51 federal arrests linked to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. He emphasized that while many protested peacefully, others hijacked the movement for lawlessness, including arson, looting, and assaults. Barr identified three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators, blaming the latter for senseless violence. He mentioned evidence of Antifa and foreign actors exacerbating the chaos. Barr also acknowledged systemic injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to address these issues. He defended President Trump's visit to St. Johnâ€™s Church as appropriate, not political. Barr stressed the need for equal protection under the law and praised police for their brave, righteous service. END OF SUMMARY.
