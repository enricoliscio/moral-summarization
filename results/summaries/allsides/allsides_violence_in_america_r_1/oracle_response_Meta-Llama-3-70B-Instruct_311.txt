SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "crimes designed to terrify fellow citizens and intimidate communities," including arson, looting, assaults, and murder. He emphasized that these actions are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather lawlessness. Barr identified three groups at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremists agitators who have "hijacked" the protests to pursue their own agendas. He stated that there is evidence that the last group is to be blamed for the violent activity, including Antifa and other similar extremist groups, as well as foreign actors playing all sides to exacerbate the violence. Barr also acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to find constructive solutions.
