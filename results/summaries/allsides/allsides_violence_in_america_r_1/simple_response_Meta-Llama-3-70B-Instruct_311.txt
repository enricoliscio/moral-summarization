SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "lawlessness" that have hijacked peaceful protests, including violent rioting, arson, looting, and assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people. He emphasized that these acts are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather crimes designed to terrorize fellow citizens and intimidate communities. Barr identified three sets of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have hijacked the protests to pursue their own agendas. He also acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to find constructive solutions. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, saying it was not a political act.
