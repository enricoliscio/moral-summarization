SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting during protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "lawlessness" that have hijacked peaceful protests, resulting in "crimes" such as arson, looting, and assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people. He emphasized that these acts are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather designed to "terrify" and "intimidate" communities. Barr also acknowledged that there is evidence of extremist groups, including Antifa, instigating and participating in violent activity. He expressed commitment to finding "constructive solutions" to address concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, emphasizing that "equal protection of the laws" is a constitutional mandate.
