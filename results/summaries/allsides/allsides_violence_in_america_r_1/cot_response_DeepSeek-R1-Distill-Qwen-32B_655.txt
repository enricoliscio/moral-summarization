Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed news article about Attorney General William Barr's statements regarding the protests and riots after George Floyd's death. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, which means I need to identify the morally charged words and then craft a summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

First, I'll tackle STEP 1: identifying all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "arrests," "violent," "rioting," "hijacked," "lawlessness," "arson," "looting," "assaults," "murder," "anarchy," "crimes," "terrify," "intimidate," "exploit," "extremist," "hijacked," "instigating," "exacerbate," "police misconduct," "injustices," "equal protection," "appropriate," and "political act." These words are used to convey the moral judgment in the article.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include these moral terms. The summary should cover the key points: the number of arrests, the types of crimes, the different groups involved, Barr's stance on the protests, his mention of Antifa and foreign actors, his commitment to addressing systemic issues, and the incident at St. John’s Church. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the arrests, moving to the groups involved, then Barr's comments on the Constitution and police, and ending with the church incident.

I should ensure that the summary is concise but comprehensive, capturing the moral framing without losing essential details. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, using the identified moral words to maintain the original tone.

Let me make sure I don't exceed 200 words. I'll check each sentence to ensure clarity and that all key points are included. Also, I'll verify that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral perspective. I'll make sure that the identified words are appropriately included without forcing them, so the summary remains natural and coherent.

**SUMMARY:**  
Attorney General William Barr reported 51 federal arrests tied to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. He condemned lawlessness, including arson, looting, assaults, and murder, calling such acts crimes, not First Amendment rights. Barr identified three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators, blaming the latter for violence. He cited evidence of Antifa, other extremists, and foreign actors fueling chaos. Barr acknowledged systemic distrust in the criminal justice system, vowing to address it. He also defended President Trump's visit to St. John’s Church, calling it "entirely appropriate," not a political act. Barr emphasized the need for constitutional equality and police accountability while working to restore order. END OF SUMMARY.
