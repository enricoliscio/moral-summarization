SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" that have occurred during the protests, including violent rioting, arson, looting, and assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people. He emphasized that these actions are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather crimes designed to terrorize and intimidate communities. Barr identified three groups of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have hijacked the protests to pursue their own agendas. He noted that evidence suggests that extremist groups, including Antifa, and foreign actors have been involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity. Barr also acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to find constructive solutions.
