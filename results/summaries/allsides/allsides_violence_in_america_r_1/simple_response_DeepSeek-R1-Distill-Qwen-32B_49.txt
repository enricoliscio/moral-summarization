Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Attorney General William Barr addressing 51 arrests related to violent protests after George Floyd's death. He mentions three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa. He emphasizes that violent acts aren't protected by the First Amendment and are crimes. He also addresses police misconduct and the need for reform, while defending the President's visit to the church.

I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral stance presented. So, I'll highlight the distinction between peaceful protest and violent crime, the targeting of extremists, and the call for reform. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly.

I'll start by mentioning the arrests and the context of George Floyd's death. Then, outline Barr's points about the groups involved, the nature of the crimes, and his stance on the First Amendment. Next, I'll include his comments on police misconduct and the need for equal justice. Finally, I'll touch on the church visit incident briefly, as it's part of the original article but not the main focus.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, each sentence building on the previous one without losing the moral perspective. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to the information given, making sure to capture the essence of Barr's statements accurately.

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr stated that 51 federal arrests have been made in connection with violent protests following the death of George Floyd, emphasizing that while many have protested peacefully, others have engaged in violent acts, including rioting, arson, looting, and attacks on law enforcement. He described these actions as "senseless anarchy" and not protected under the First Amendment. Barr identified three groups involved in the protests: peaceful demonstrators, opportunistic looters, and extremist agitators, with evidence pointing to groups like Antifa and foreign actors instigating violence. He acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and called for reforms to rebuild trust in the criminal justice system, stating that equal protection under the law is non-negotiable. Barr also defended President Trump's visit to St. Johnâ€™s Church, asserting it was not a political act but a legitimate action as the head of the executive branch. END OF SUMMARY.
