SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "lawlessness" that have hijacked peaceful protests, including violent rioting, arson, looting, and assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people. He emphasized that such acts are not exercises of First Amendment rights, but rather crimes designed to terrify and intimidate communities. Barr identified three sets of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have hijacked the protests to pursue their own agendas. He acknowledged that many African Americans lack confidence in the criminal justice system and vowed to find constructive solutions to address police misconduct and injustices.

END OF SUMMARY.
