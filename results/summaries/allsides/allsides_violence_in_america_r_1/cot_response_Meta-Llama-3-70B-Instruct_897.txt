SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "lawlessness" that have hijacked peaceful protests, resulting in violent rioting, arson, looting, and assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people. He emphasized that such acts are "crimes designed to terrorize fellow citizens and intimidate communities," and not exercises of First Amendment rights. Barr also acknowledged that many African Americans lack confidence in the criminal justice system, which is "undeniable" and "unacceptable." He vowed to find "constructive solutions" to address these concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
