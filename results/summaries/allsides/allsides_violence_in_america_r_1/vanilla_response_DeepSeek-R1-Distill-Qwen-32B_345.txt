Okay, so the user has provided a news article about Attorney General William Barr's statements regarding the arrests and the situation following George Floyd's death. They want a summary of this article. The user specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are:

1. 51 federal arrests related to violent rioting.
2. Barr mentions three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa.
3. He accuses foreign actors of exacerbating the violence.
4. Barr acknowledges issues in the criminal justice system and plans to meet with community leaders.
5. He defends Trump's visit to the church, calling it appropriate.

I should condense these points into a concise summary. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and includes all the main elements without going into too much detail. Also, I need to use the specified tokens at the beginning and end.

I'll start by mentioning the 51 arrests, then the three groups, the involvement of Antifa and foreign actors, the acknowledgment of justice issues, and the comment on Trump's visit. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and to the point, avoiding any unnecessary details.

Let me draft it:

"Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 federal arrests have been made in connection with violent rioting following George Floyd's death. He identified three groups involved: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa, whom he blamed for much of the violence. Barr also accused foreign actors of fueling the unrest. He acknowledged systemic issues in the criminal justice system and plans to meet with community leaders to address these concerns. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John’s Church, calling it appropriate and not a political act."

Now, checking the word count. That's 100 words. I can add a bit more detail without exceeding 200 words. Maybe include the mention of Chauvin's charges and the purpose of the meeting.

"Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 federal arrests have been made in connection with violent rioting following George Floyd's death. He identified three groups involved: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa, whom he blamed for much of the violence. Barr also accused foreign actors of fueling the unrest. He acknowledged systemic issues in the criminal justice system and plans to meet with community leaders to address these concerns. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John’s Church, calling it appropriate and not a political act. The charges against Derek Chauvin and other officers involved in Floyd's death were also mentioned."

That's 120 words. Still under 200. Maybe add more about the charges.

"Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 federal arrests have been made in connection with violent rioting following George Floyd's death. He identified three groups involved: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa, whom he blamed for much of the violence. Barr also accused foreign actors of fueling the unrest. He acknowledged systemic issues in the criminal justice system and plans to meet with community leaders to address these concerns. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John’s Church, calling it appropriate and not a political act. The charges against Derek Chauvin and other officers involved in Floyd's death were also mentioned, with Chauvin facing second-degree murder charges."

Now, 130 words. I think that's sufficient. It covers all main points without being too lengthy. I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

Final check: clarity, conciseness, and inclusion of all key points. Yes, this should meet the user's requirements.
