SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and emphasized that such acts are crimes, not exercises of First Amendment rights. He identified three sets of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators who have "hijacked" the protests. Barr stated that evidence suggests Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors, are involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity. He also acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, promising to work towards "constructive solutions." Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, calling it "entirely appropriate" and not a "political act."
