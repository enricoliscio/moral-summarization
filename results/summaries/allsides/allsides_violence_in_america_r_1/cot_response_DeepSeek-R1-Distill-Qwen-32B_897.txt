Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want a summary that includes morally charged words from the original text. 

Looking at the article, I notice words like "arrests," "violent rioting," "protests," "looting," "assaults," "murder," "anarchy," "First Amendment rights," "crimes," "senseless," "outrage," "murder," "charged," "extremist," "looting," "hijacked," "agendas," "violent activity," "Antifa," "foreign actors," "exacerbate," "police misconduct," "injustices," "equal protection," "constitutional," "executive branch," "political act," "church," "photos," "clearing," "perimeter," "appropriate," "executive," "nation," "outside," "street," "view," "non-political."

I need to make sure the summary includes these words where appropriate. I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the arrests, the Attorney General's comments on the different groups involved, the mention of Antifa and foreign actors, the call for justice, and the incident with the President visiting the church.

I should also keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while maintaining the moral tone from the original article. I'll start by mentioning the 51 arrests, then the Attorney General's stance on the violence versus peaceful protest, the involvement of extremist groups, the charges against the police officers, and the incident at the church. Finally, I'll touch on Barr's commitment to addressing systemic issues in the criminal justice system.

I need to make sure each morally framed word is included where it makes sense, without forcing them in. The summary should reflect the article's focus on the moral issues surrounding the protests, the violence, and the call for justice and reform.

**SUMMARY:**  

Attorney General William Barr reported 51 arrests for federal crimes linked to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. He emphasized that while many protested peacefully, others engaged in lawlessness, including arson, looting, and assaults. Barr condemned such acts as senseless anarchy, not protected by the First Amendment. Floyd's death, caused by a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on him for nearly nine minutes, sparked widespread outrage. The officer and others involved were charged with murder and related crimes. Barr identified three groups at protests: peaceful demonstrators, looters, and extremist agitators, with evidence pointing to Antifa and foreign actors instigating violence. He also addressed concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, committing to finding solutions. Barr defended President Trump's visit to St. Johnâ€™s Church, calling it appropriate and non-political. He stressed the need for equal protection under the law and urged reforms to restore trust in the system.
