Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "arrests," "federal crimes," "violent rioting," "outrage," "protests," "looting," "assaults," "murder," "anarchy," "First Amendment rights," "crimes," "senseless," "terrorize," "intimidate," "exploit," "extremist agitators," "hijacked," "violent activity," "Antifa," "foreign actors," "exacerbate," "police misconduct," "injustices," "equal protection," "constitutional," "head of the executive branch," "chief executive," "political act." I'll list each of these with an asterisk.

Next, I have to write a concise summary, under 200 words, incorporating as many of these moral terms as possible. The summary should highlight the key points: the number of arrests, the Attorney General's statements about the different groups involved, the violence, and the underlying issues like police misconduct and the need for change. I'll make sure to mention the constitutional aspect and the political context of the president's visit.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while emphasizing the moral aspects. I should avoid adding any new information not present in the article and stick strictly to the provided text.

Finally, I'll structure the response by first listing the morally framed words and then providing the summary, making sure to include the required tokens and keep the summary within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Attorney General William Barr reported 51 federal arrests tied to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. He emphasized that while many protested peacefully, others engaged in senseless acts of anarchy, including looting, arson, and assaults, which are not protected under the First Amendment. Barr identified three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators, with evidence pointing to Antifa and foreign actors instigating violence. He acknowledged systemic issues in the criminal justice system and the need for change to ensure equal protection under the law. Barr also defended President Trump's visit to St. Johnâ€™s Church, calling it an appropriate action as the head of the executive branch, not a political act. END OF SUMMARY.
