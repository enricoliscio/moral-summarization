SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. While many have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have hijacked protests to engage in lawlessness, violent rioting, and arson. Barr condemned these senseless acts of anarchy, stating that they are crimes designed to terrorize fellow citizens and intimidate communities. He identified three sets of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have hijacked the protests to pursue their own agendas. Barr acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to find constructive solutions. He emphasized that the vast majority of police officers do their job bravely and righteously, and that equal protection of the laws is mandated by the Constitution.
