SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced 51 arrests for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over George Floyd's death. Barr differentiated between peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators who "hijacked" demonstrations to engage in "lawlessness." He condemned "senseless acts of anarchy," including arson, looting, assaults, and murder, as crimes designed to terrify and intimidate. Barr acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, noting that many African Americans lack confidence in the system. He affirmed the Constitution's mandate for equal protection and deemed the president's visit to St. John's Church appropriate, dismissing correlations with the clearing of protesters. The attorney general pledged to find constructive solutions, emphasizing the need for change and equal protection under the law.
