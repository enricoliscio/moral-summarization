Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Attorney General William Barr discussing the arrests related to the protests over George Floyd's death. He mentions 51 federal arrests for violent rioting, including arson, looting, and assaults. He differentiates between peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa. Barr also talks about the involvement of foreign actors and addresses police misconduct concerns. He plans to meet with community leaders. Additionally, he comments on Trump's visit to the church, saying it wasn't a political move.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating the main points: 51 arrests, types of crimes, categorization of protesters, mention of Antifa and foreign involvement, Barr's plans, and the church visit context. I should keep it concise, ensuring all key elements are included without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: Begin with the number of arrests and the crimes. Then explain the three groups of protesters. Mention Antifa and foreign actors. Note Barr's meeting and his stance on police issues. Finally, touch on the church visit and his defense of it. Make sure it flows logically and stays within the word limit.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." Let me draft it now, making sure each sentence is clear and concise.
