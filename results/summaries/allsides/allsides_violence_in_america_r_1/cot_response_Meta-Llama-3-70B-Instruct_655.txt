SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "lawlessness" that have hijacked peaceful protests, resulting in "violent rioting, arson, looting, and assaults" on law enforcement officers and innocent people. He emphasized that these acts are "crimes designed to terrorize fellow citizens and intimidate communities," and not exercises of First Amendment rights. Barr acknowledged that many African Americans lack confidence in the criminal justice system, which is "undeniable" and "unacceptable." He vowed to find "constructive solutions" to address police misconduct and injustices. The attorney general also defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, calling it "entirely appropriate" and not a "political act."
