SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. Barr stated that while many have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have "hijacked" protests to engage in "lawlessness" - including "violent rioting", "arson", "looting" of businesses and public property, "assaults" on law enforcement officers and innocent people, and even the "murder" of a federal agent. These "senseless acts of anarchy" are designed to "terrify" fellow citizens and "intimidate" communities. Barr identified three groups at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremists agitators who have "hijacked" the protests to pursue their own agendas. He emphasized that the latter group is to be blamed for the violent activity, and that there is evidence of involvement by Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors seeking to "exacerbate" the violence. Barr also acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to find "constructive solutions".
