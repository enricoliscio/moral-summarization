SUMMARY: Authorities have made 51 arrests for federal crimes related to violent rioting and protests over the death of George Floyd, according to Attorney General William Barr. Barr stated that while many individuals have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have engaged in looting, arson, and assaults, hijacking the protests to commit crimes and intimidate communities. He condemned such acts of anarchy and violence, adding that they are not protected by the First Amendment. Barr also acknowledged the concerns of protesters regarding police misconduct and injustices within the criminal justice system, pledging to find constructive solutions. The attorney general differentiated between peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators who are to blame for the violent activity. Evidence suggests the involvement of Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors exacerbating the violence. Barr emphasized the need to restore order and protect innocent citizens while also addressing the legitimate grievances of those protesting against racial injustice and police misconduct. He defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church as appropriate and non-political.

END OF SUMMARY.
