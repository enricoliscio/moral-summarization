SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amid protests over the death of George Floyd. While many have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have engaged in lawlessness, anarchy, and senseless acts of violence, including arson, looting, and assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people. Barr condemned these crimes, stating that they are designed to terrify fellow citizens and intimidate communities. He identified three sets of actors at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have hijacked the protests to pursue their own agendas. Barr acknowledged that many African Americans lack confidence in the criminal justice system, which he deemed unacceptable and vowed to find constructive solutions. END OF SUMMARY.
