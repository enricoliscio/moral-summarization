Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

The article is about Attorney General William Barr discussing the 51 arrests related to federal crimes during the protests over George Floyd's death. He mentions the Justice Department and other agencies are working to restore order. He talks about three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists, especially Antifa and foreign actors. He also addresses police misconduct concerns and mentions a meeting to find solutions. Plus, he defends Trump's visit to the church.

I should start by identifying the main points: 51 arrests, types of crimes, three groups involved, mention of Antifa and foreign interference, addressing police issues, and the church visit. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include key details without getting too wordy.

I'll structure it by first stating the arrests, then the groups, the crimes, mention Antifa and foreign actors, touch on the police and justice system issues, and briefly mention the church visit. I'll make sure to keep each sentence clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details.

Let me draft that and check the word count. I need to ensure it's all within the limit and flows naturally. Maybe start with the arrests, then the groups, the crimes, the specific groups involved, the meeting, and end with the church visit explanation. That should cover all the main points succinctly.
