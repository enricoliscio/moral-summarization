Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Attorney General William Barr addressing the situation regarding the protests after George Floyd's death. He mentions 51 arrests for federal crimes related to violent rioting. The protests have been peaceful for many, but others have caused violence, looting, and even murder of a federal agent. Barr talks about three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa. He also mentions foreign actors involved. He addresses police misconduct concerns and plans to meet with community leaders. Additionally, he comments on Trump's visit to the church, saying it wasn't a political move.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: 51 arrests, types of crimes, three groups involved, Antifa's role, foreign influence, Barr's stance on police reform, and the church visit context.

Let me structure this: start with the arrests, then the groups, mention Antifa and foreign actors, address police issues, and end with the church visit part. Keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed.

Wait, should I mention George Floyd's death and Chauvin's charges? Yes, it's important context. Also, the three officers charged. But maybe keep it brief.

I think I have all the main points. Now, let me put it together in a coherent way, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll check the word count after writing.
