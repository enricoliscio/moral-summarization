Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The user mentioned that I should be a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. Hmm, that means I need to not just extract the main points but also maintain the ethical perspective presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Attorney General William Barr discussing the 51 arrests related to violent rioting during the protests over George Floyd's death. He mentions three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists. He blames Antifa and other groups for the violence and mentions foreign actors involved. He also addresses police misconduct and plans to meet with community leaders. There's also a part about Trump's visit to the church.

Now, the moral framing here seems to be that while the protests are about legitimate issues, the violence is being exploited by others. Barr is emphasizing that the violence isn't protected by the First Amendment and is a crime. He's also trying to separate the peaceful protesters from the violent ones, suggesting that the latter are hijacking the movement. Additionally, he's addressing systemic issues in the criminal justice system but also wants to focus on the violent acts as separate issues.

I need to make sure the summary reflects this balance. It should mention the arrests, the分类 of the protesters into three groups, the blame on extremists, the mention of foreign actors, and the acknowledgment of systemic issues without downplaying the violence.

I should also keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first state the arrests, then the分类 of protesters, the blame on extremists, the mention of foreign interference, the call for reform, and the mention of Trump's visit as a side note.

I need to ensure that the moral perspective is clear: the article condemns the violence while acknowledging the underlying issues. So the summary should reflect both the criticism of the violent acts and the call for addressing systemic injustices.

Let me draft this step by step. Start with the arrests, then the three groups, the blame on Antifa and others, mention of foreign actors, the call for reform, and the Trump visit part. Keep each point brief but clear.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural, as per the user's request. Also, ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any additional formatting.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let me put it all together in a concise manner, making sure each key point is included without exceeding the word limit.
