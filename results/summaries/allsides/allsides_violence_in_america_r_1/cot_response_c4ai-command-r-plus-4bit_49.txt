SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr announced 51 arrests for federal crimes related to violent rioting during the protests over the murder of George Floyd. Barr emphasized the distinction between peaceful protesters exercising their First Amendment rights and those engaging in violent and criminal acts, including rioting, looting, and arson. He attributed the violence to extremist agitators, such as Antifa, and foreign actors. Barr acknowledged the legitimate concerns of protesters about police misconduct and injustices within the criminal justice system, pledging to find constructive solutions. He defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church as appropriate and not a political act, stating that the President should be able to walk across the street to the church without it being interpreted as a political statement. Barr reiterated that the Constitution mandates equal protection under the law and that the lack of confidence in the criminal justice system among African Americans must change.
