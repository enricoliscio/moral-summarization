Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about Attorney General William Barr's statement regarding the arrests made during the protests over George Floyd's death. He mentions 51 federal arrests for violent rioting, including arson, looting, and assaults. He also talks about different groups involved: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists like Antifa. He claims these extremists are behind the violence and that foreign actors are involved too. Barr also addresses police misconduct concerns and plans to meet with community leaders. Additionally, he comments on President Trump's visit to a church, saying it wasn't a political move.

So, the key points are: 51 arrests, types of crimes, three groups involved, blaming extremists, foreign influence, addressing police issues, and the President's church visit. I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I should make sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. Maybe structure it by first stating the arrests, then the groups, the causes of the violence, the police misconduct part, and the President's visit. Keep it clear and straightforward.

Let me try to put it together. Start with Barr's announcement, mention the 51 arrests, describe the violent acts. Then talk about the groups, emphasizing the extremists and foreign influence. Then address the police issues and the meeting with leaders. Finally, touch on the President's visit and Barr's comments on it.

I need to make sure it's all within 200 words. Let me count the words as I go. Also, avoid any markdown, just plain text. Okay, I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
