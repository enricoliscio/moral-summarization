Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They've specified to use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. I need to make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes those terms. 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. The main points are the 51 arrests, the Attorney General's statement about the three groups involved in the protests, the mention of Antifa and foreign actors, and the issues with police misconduct. Also, there's the part about Barr's response to Trump's visit to the church.

I should structure the summary to highlight the crimes committed, the efforts to restore order, and the different groups involved. I need to include words like 'crimes,' 'rioting,' 'violence,' 'hijacked,' 'looting,''murder,' 'anarchy,' etc. 

I'll start by stating the number of arrests and the context of George Floyd's death. Then, mention the three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists. Include the involvement of Antifa and foreign actors. Also, address the police misconduct concerns and Barr's commitment to change. Finally, touch on the church incident and Barr's defense of Trump's actions.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral framing words provided. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Attorney General William Barr reported 51 arrests for federal crimes tied to violent rioting following George Floyd's death, emphasizing efforts to restore order and quell outbreaks of violence. He condemned senseless acts of anarchy, such as arson, looting, assaults, and murder, stating these are not protected by the First Amendment but are crimes designed to terrify and intimidate. Barr identified three groups at protests: peaceful protesters, looters exploiting the chaos, and extremists hijacking the movement for their agendas. He cited evidence of Antifa and foreign actors instigating violence. While acknowledging police misconduct and systemic injustices, Barr committed to finding solutions to rebuild trust in the criminal justice system. He also defended President Trump's visit to St. Johnâ€™s Church, calling it appropriate and not a political act. Barr stressed the need for equal protection under the law, acknowledging the lack of confidence many African Americans have in the system. END OF SUMMARY.
