SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr announced that 51 arrests have been made for federal crimes related to violent rioting amidst protests over George Floyd's death. Barr condemned the "senseless acts of anarchy" and "crimes designed to terrify fellow citizens and intimidate communities," emphasizing that these actions are not exercises of First Amendment rights. He identified three groups at the demonstrations: peaceful protesters, groups exploiting the opportunity to engage in looting, and extremist agitators who have "hijacked" the protests to pursue their own agendas. Barr stated that evidence points to Antifa and other extremist groups, as well as foreign actors, instigating and participating in the violent activity. He acknowledged concerns about police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to find "constructive solutions" to restore trust. Barr also defended President Trump's visit to St. John's Church, calling it "entirely appropriate" and not a "political act."
