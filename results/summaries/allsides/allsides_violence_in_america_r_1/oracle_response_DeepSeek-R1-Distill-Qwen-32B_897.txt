Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about Attorney General William Barr discussing 51 arrests related to federal crimes during the protests over George Floyd's death. He mentions three groups: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists. He also addresses police misconduct and the need for reform.

I need to make sure I include words like crimes, rioting, death, restore, quell, violence, hijacked, engage, arson, looting, assaults, murder, anarchy, terrify, intimidate, died, knelt, riots, exploiting, pursue, violent, instigating, participating, playing, exacerbate, misconduct, injustices, do, protection.

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: arrests, the three groups, the violent acts, the context of Floyd's death, and Barr's comments on police and justice reform. I need to keep it under 200 words and use the morally framed words where possible.

Let me draft a concise version, ensuring I hit all key points and include the specified terms. I'll make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr reported 51 federal arrests tied to violent rioting during protests over George Floyd's death. He emphasized the Justice Department's efforts to restore order and quell violence, describing senseless acts of anarchy, including arson, looting, assaults, and murder, as crimes meant to terrify and intimidate. Floyd's death, caused by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck, sparked nationwide outrage. Barr identified three groups at protests: peaceful demonstrators, looters exploiting the chaos, and extremists hijacking the movement for their agendas. He accused Antifa and other groups of instigating violence, with foreign actors exacerbating the turmoil. Barr acknowledged police misconduct and injustices in the criminal justice system, vowing to address these issues. He also defended President Trump's visit to St. Johnâ€™s Church, calling it appropriate and not political.
