Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it first.

The article is about Attorney General William Barr discussing arrests related to the protests over George Floyd's death. He mentions 51 federal arrests for violent acts like rioting, arson, and looting. He distinguishes between peaceful protesters, looters, and extremists, blaming the latter for violence. He also addresses police misconduct concerns and mentions meeting with community leaders. There's a part about Trump visiting a church, which Barr defends.

I should highlight the key points: arrests,分类 of protesters, blame on extremists, addressing systemic issues, and the political aspect of Trump's visit. I need to keep the moral tone, emphasizing the distinction between lawful protest and criminal acts, and the call for justice.

Let me structure the summary to include all these elements concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and captures the moral stance presented.

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr reported 51 federal arrests related to violent protests following George Floyd's death, emphasizing that while many protested peacefully, others engaged in lawlessness, including rioting, arson, looting, and attacks on law enforcement. Barr identified three groups at protests: peaceful protesters, looters, and extremist agitators, blaming the latter for much of the violence. He cited evidence of involvement by Antifa, other extremists, and foreign actors. Barr acknowledged systemic issues in the criminal justice system, particularly a lack of trust among African Americans, and promised to address these concerns with community leaders. He also defended President Trump's visit to St. John’s Church, calling it appropriate and not a political act. Barr stressed that violent acts are crimes, not First Amendment rights, and emphasized the need for equal justice under the law. END OF SUMMARY.
