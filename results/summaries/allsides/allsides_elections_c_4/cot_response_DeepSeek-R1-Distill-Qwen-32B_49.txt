Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to find words that carry moral connotations. The article discusses Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's contrasting approaches. Words like "suing" women, "governing," "avenging," "personal grievances," "extraordinary," "charges," "business," "scores," "invested," "settle," "danger," "democratic traditions," "disregard," "constitutional freedoms," "protection," "independence," "leadership," "dictatorship," "gridlock," "difference," and "influence" stand out as they relate to moral or ethical issues.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, making sure to include these morally framed words. The key points are Clinton's criticism of Trump's plan to sue accusers, his threat to not concede, and her focus on policy over personal vendettas. I should also mention the Pennsylvania focus and her support for Katie McGinty.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the contrast between Clinton and Trump, emphasizing their approaches and the moral implications. I'll ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit while including the identified terms.
