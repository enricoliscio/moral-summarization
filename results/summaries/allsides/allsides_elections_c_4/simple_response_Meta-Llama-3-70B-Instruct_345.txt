SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton drew a stark contrast between her and Donald Trump's approaches to governing, highlighting Trump's focus on personal grievances over the needs of the American people. Trump threatened to sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, demonstrating a disturbing disregard for the rule of law and the principles of democracy. Clinton, on the other hand, emphasized her commitment to working for the people, starting from day one of her presidency. She also criticized Trump's refusal to accept election results, labeling it a hallmark of dictatorship. Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, echoed her sentiments, accusing Trump of being more invested in settling personal scores than in serving the nation. The contrast between the two candidates' values and priorities could not be clearer, with Clinton championing democratic traditions and the rule of law, while Trump promotes a culture of vengeance and authoritarianism.
