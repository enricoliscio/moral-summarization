SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's plans for his first 100 days in office, focusing on his intention to sue women who have accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Clinton contrasted Trump's vengeful agenda with her own focus on governing and serving the American people. Trump's comments were particularly concerning to college-educated women, a demographic Clinton has been trying to reach. Clinton emphasized Trump's disregard for democratic traditions, including his refusal to concede the election and his disregard for constitutional freedoms. She highlighted the importance of respecting the law and the independent judiciary, contrasting Trump's desire to jail his opponent with America's legal system. Clinton also supported Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who could help break the gridlock and promote Clinton's policy agenda. Kaine echoed Clinton's concerns, noting Trump's personal investment in settling scores. The Clinton campaign is focusing on Pennsylvania, a key state that could impact the election outcome.
END OF SUMMARY.
