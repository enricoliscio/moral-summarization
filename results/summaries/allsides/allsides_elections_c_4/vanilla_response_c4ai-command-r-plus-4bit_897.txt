SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, spoke to reporters on their campaign plane, drawing a contrast between their plans for the first 100 days in office and those of their rival, Donald Trump. Clinton criticized Trump's focus on avenging personal grievances, including his intention to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. She emphasized her commitment to governing and respecting democratic traditions, including accepting election results. Clinton also highlighted the importance of down-ballot races, supporting Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, and the need to break through gridlock in Congress. Kaine joined in, noting Trump's obsession with settling personal scores. The Clinton campaign is focusing on Pennsylvania, aiming to block one of Trump's paths to the required 270 electoral votes. Clinton reiterated her stance on democratic values and the rule of law, contrasting it with Trump's desire to jail his opponent.
