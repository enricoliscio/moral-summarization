SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to governance with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intention to sue women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton emphasized that Trump seems more intent on avenging personal grievances than governing, whereas she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are focused on preparing to serve the American people. Clinton warned that Trump's behavior is a danger to America's democratic traditions, citing his refusal to accept election results and his disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections. She also criticized Trump's suggestion that she should be jailed, stating that "we don't do that in America" and that we have laws, courts, and an independent judiciary. Clinton's remarks aimed to appeal to college-educated women who normally vote Republican. END OF SUMMARY.
