Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral elements involved.

The article is about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's approaches to their first 100 days in office. Clinton is contrasting her plans with Trump's, specifically focusing on Trump's threat to sue women who accused him of sexual misconduct. She's emphasizing that Trump is more interested in personal vendettas than governing, which is a moral point against him.

I should identify the morally framed words. Looking through the article, words like "suing," "accusers," "charges," "governing," "personal grievances," "scores," "settle," "mad," "danger," "democratic traditions," "leadership," "dictatorship," "constitutional freedoms," "protections," "jail," "opponent," "independent judiciary," "gridlock," and "difference" stand out. These words carry moral weight, highlighting issues of justice, fairness, and the integrity of democratic processes.

Now, for the summary. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll start by stating the contrast between Clinton and Trump's approaches. Mention Trump's threat to sue, Clinton's focus on governance, and her concerns about Trump's impact on democracy. Also, include her reference to the judiciary and her support for the Senate candidate to show her broader strategy.

I'll make sure the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral issues without getting bogged down in details. It's important to convey that Clinton is positioning herself as a leader committed to the public good, while Trump is seen as self-serving and threatening to democratic norms.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's concise and captures all the key moral points from the article. I'll check that each identified word is included where appropriate and that the summary accurately reflects the original text's moral framing.
