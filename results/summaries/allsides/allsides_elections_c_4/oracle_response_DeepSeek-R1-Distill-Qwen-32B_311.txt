Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words: sue, unwanted, intent, avenging, suing, invested, concede, failing, leadership, dictatorship, disregard, jailed, jail, break. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Hillary Clinton is contrasting her approach with Trump's. Trump threatened to sue women who accused him, which is a moral issue. Clinton emphasizes her intent to govern and work for the people, while Trump seems focused on personal grievances and avenging.

I should highlight the moral words like "sue" and "avenging" to show Trump's negative actions. Clinton's focus on leadership and breaking gridlock are positive moral points. Also, mention how Trump's failure to concede shows disregard for democracy, contrasting with Clinton's leadership.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by stating the contrast, Trump's actions, Clinton's approach, and the implications for leadership and democracy. Make sure to include all relevant moral words without making it too lengthy.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows naturally and includes the key moral elements. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

Clinton criticized Trump for prioritizing revenge over serving the American people, highlighting his intent to avenge personal scores. She stressed that her campaign would focus on preparing to address the nation's needs from day one, unlike Trump, who seemed more invested in settling disputes. Clinton also criticized Trump for failing to demonstrate leadership by refusing to concede in the event of a loss, suggesting a disregard for democratic traditions. She contrasted this with her own commitment to uphold the rule of law, rejecting Trump's calls to jail her for her email use. Clinton further highlighted the importance of down-ballot races, emphasizing how Democratic candidates like Katie McGinty could break gridlock and make a difference. END OF SUMMARY.
