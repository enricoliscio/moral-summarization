Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's campaigns. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article talks about Hillary Clinton contrasting her approach with Donald Trump's during their first 100 days. She mentions that Trump wants to sue women who accused him, while she and Tim Kaine are focused on governing. They were speaking on their campaign plane, and Kaine added that Trump seems more interested in settling personal scores than governing.

Earlier, Trump spoke at Gettysburg, outlining his agenda and threatening to sue accusers. Clinton's campaign is targeting college-educated women, a group that usually votes Republican. She criticized Trump for not accepting election results, calling it a difference between leadership and dictatorship. She also addressed his claim that she should be jailed for her email use, emphasizing the rule of law.

Clinton also talked about the Senate race in Pennsylvania, supporting Katie McGinty against Pat Toomey, which is important for Democrats to regain control of the Senate. The article mentions that Pennsylvania is a key state for both campaigns, with Clinton's victory there potentially affecting Trump's path to 270 electoral votes.

So, the main points are:
1. Clinton vs. Trump on their first 100 days.
2. Trump suing accusers vs. Clinton's focus on governance.
3. Clinton's criticism of Trump's handling of election results and his threats against her.
4. The importance of Pennsylvania and the Senate race for Clinton's strategy.

I need to condense these into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should make sure to include the contrast between the two candidates, the focus on women voters, the legal threats, and the significance of Pennsylvania. Also, mention Clinton's emphasis on the rule of law and the Senate race.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered succinctly without going over the word limit.
