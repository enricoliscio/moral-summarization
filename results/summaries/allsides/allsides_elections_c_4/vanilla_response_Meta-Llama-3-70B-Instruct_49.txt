SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, contrasted their approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intention to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton emphasized that she and Kaine would focus on governing, whereas Trump seemed more interested in settling personal scores. Clinton criticized Trump's remarks, saying that failing to accept election results and threatening to jail opponents are undemocratic and un-American. She also campaigned for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Pat Toomey, and emphasized the importance of down-ballot races in achieving her policy agenda. Clinton's comments were seen as an attempt to appeal to college-educated women who normally vote Republican.
