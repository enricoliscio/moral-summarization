Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's campaigns. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to get the main points.

The article talks about how Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are contrasting their approach with Trump's. They focus on Trump's threat to sue women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton and Kaine argue that Trump is more interested in personal vendettas than governing. They emphasize their commitment to working on policies immediately after the election.

I should note the moral aspects here. Clinton is highlighting Trump's lack of commitment to democratic principles and his personal grievances. She's also talking about the importance of respecting the election results and the rule of law, which are key moral points.

The article also mentions the focus on Pennsylvania and the Senate race. Clinton is supporting Katie McGinty, which shows she's looking at the bigger picture beyond just the presidency.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these moral framings. I'll structure it to first mention the contrast between Clinton and Trump, then touch on the personal vs. policy focus, the democratic principles, and the broader campaign strategy.

Let me make sure I include all the key points without getting too detailed. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's all. Time to put it together clearly and succinctly.
