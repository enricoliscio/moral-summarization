Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, okay, so I should focus on the key points where Clinton is highlighting Trump's behavior in a negative light.

First, I see that Clinton is contrasting her approach with Trump's. She mentions his intention to sue women who accused him of sexual misconduct. That's a strong moral point, so I should include that. She's positioning herself as focused on governance, while Trump is on personal vendettas. 

Next, the article talks about Trump's speech at Gettysburg. He laid out his 100-day plan but also threatened to sue accusers. Clinton's campaign is targeting college-educated women, so this is a strategic move to appeal to them. I should note that she's emphasizing this to contrast their priorities.

Clinton also brings up Trump's refusal to concede, comparing it to dictatorship, which is a heavy moral statement. She's highlighting his disrespect for democratic norms. Additionally, she criticizes his call to jail her, pointing out that it's not how things work in America, which reinforces her moral stance on the rule of law.

She also mentions the Senate race, showing she's thinking beyond the presidency. That's about the bigger picture and policy impact, which is another layer to her campaign strategy.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all these moral points. I'll structure it by first introducing the contrast, then detailing each moral critique, and finally touching on her broader campaign efforts. Make sure the language reflects the moral framing without being too biased, just presenting the facts as Clinton presents them.
