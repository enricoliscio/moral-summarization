SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, spoke to reporters on their campaign plane, contrasting their approach to the first 100 days in office with that of Donald Trump. Clinton criticized Trump for threatening to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, saying he is more focused on avenging personal grievances than governing. In contrast, Clinton emphasized her commitment to working on behalf of the American people, starting on January 20. Clinton also reiterated her concerns about Trump's disregard for democratic traditions, citing his refusal to concede the election and his suggestion that she should be jailed. At a rally in Pittsburgh, Clinton made a case for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Pat Toomey. Clinton's focus on down-ballot races indicates her consideration of how to implement her policy agenda if she wins the presidency.
