Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's campaign events. Let me read through the article carefully first.

The article starts by talking about Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, addressing reporters on their campaign plane. They contrast their approach to the first 100 days in office with Trump's. Trump had gone to Gettysburg and mentioned suing women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton and Kaine criticized Trump for focusing on personal grievances instead of governing.

Clinton emphasized that she and Kaine would focus on their agenda and be ready to work immediately after the election. She also criticized Trump for not committing to concede if he loses, calling it a threat to democracy. She mentioned Trump's suggestion to jail her for her email use, pointing out that it's not how things work in America.

Additionally, the article mentions Clinton supporting Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, highlighting the importance of down-ballot races for her policy agenda.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Clinton and Kaine's contrast with Trump's focus on suing accusers, their readiness to work, Clinton's criticism of Trump's potential refusal to concede, her comments on the email issue, and her support for McGinty.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, capturing all these elements without going into too much detail. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered.
