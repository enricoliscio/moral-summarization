SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intention to sue women who accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Clinton emphasized that she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, would focus on governing, while Trump seemed more intent on avenging personal grievances. Clinton warned that Trump's behavior poses a danger to America's democratic traditions, citing his refusal to concede the election and his disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections. She also criticized Trump's contention that she should be jailed for using a private email system, stressing that "we don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary." Clinton's campaign is targeting college-educated women who normally vote Republican, and her victory in Pennsylvania could cut off Trump's path to 270 electoral votes. END OF SUMMARY.
