SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intent to sue women who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Clinton argued that Trump is more focused on avenging personal grievances than governing, whereas she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are committed to working for the American people. Trump's remarks, made at the Gettysburg Civil War battlefield, showed a disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections, Clinton said. She also criticized Trump's failure to concede the election, which she likened to a dictatorship. Clinton emphasized the importance of leadership, laws, and an independent judiciary, implying that Trump's approach is a threat to these values. In contrast, Clinton and Kaine are invested in doing the business of the American people, and Clinton is committed to breaking through gridlock to make a difference in people's lives. END OF SUMMARY.
