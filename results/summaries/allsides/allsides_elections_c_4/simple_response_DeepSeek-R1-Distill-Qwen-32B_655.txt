Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The user wants a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points and the underlying moral messages.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's approaches to their first 100 days. Clinton is emphasizing her focus on governance and contrast that with Trump's personal vendettas, especially suing women who accused him of sexual harassment.

The article mentions that Trump spoke at Gettysburg about his agenda, which included suing accusers. Clinton uses this to appeal to college-educated women, a key demographic. She also talks about Trump's potential refusal to concede, linking it to a threat to democracy.

Additionally, Clinton supports a Senate candidate, Katie McGinty, showing her focus on broader political implications beyond the presidency.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the contrast between Clinton's governance focus and Trump's personal vendettas, the moral implications of Trump's actions, and Clinton's emphasis on democratic traditions and the importance of Senate races.

I'll start by stating that Clinton contrasted her approach with Trump's, focusing on governance vs. personal grievances. Then mention Trump's plan to sue accusers and Clinton's moral stance on this. Include her criticism of Trump's potential refusal to concede and the threat to democracy. Finally, touch on her support for McGinty and the broader political strategy.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it concisely, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.
