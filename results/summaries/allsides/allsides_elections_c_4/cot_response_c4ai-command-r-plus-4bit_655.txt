SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's focus on avenging personal grievances, specifically his contention to sue his accusers. Clinton drew a moral contrast between their agendas, emphasizing Trump's disregard for democratic traditions and his troubling desire to jail his opponent. She highlighted the importance of respecting laws, courts, and an independent judiciary. Clinton also showed moral investment in down-ballot races, believing they would affect her policy agenda and help break through gridlock. Kaine echoed these sentiments, alluding to Trump's personal scores and anger. The Clinton campaign aimed to gain the attention of college-educated women, leveraging Trump's morally questionable remarks. END OF SUMMARY.
