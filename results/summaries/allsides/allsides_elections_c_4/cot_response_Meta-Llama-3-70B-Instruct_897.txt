SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intention to sue women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Clinton emphasized that she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are focused on governing, whereas Trump seems more intent on avenging personal grievances. Clinton warned that Trump's behavior is a danger to America's democratic traditions, citing his refusal to accept election results and his disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections. She also criticized Trump's contention that she should be jailed for using a private email system, emphasizing that "we don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary." Clinton's campaign is targeting college-educated women who normally vote Republican, and she is also focusing on down-ballot races, such as the Pennsylvania Senate race, to ensure a friendlier Congress.
