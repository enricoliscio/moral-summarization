SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's plans for his first 100 days in office, focusing on his intention to sue women who have accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Clinton contrasted her focus on governing with Trump's desire for avenging personal grievances. She emphasized the importance of accepting election results, portraying Trump's refusal to concede as a threat to America's democratic traditions and a disregard for constitutional freedoms. Clinton highlighted the absurdity of Trump's claim that she should be jailed, pointing to America's independent judiciary. She also supported Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, recognizing the impact of down-ballot races on her policy agenda. Kaine echoed Clinton's sentiments, noting Trump's investment in settling personal scores. The Clinton campaign is targeting college-educated women who typically vote Republican, while also focusing on Pennsylvania as a key state to block Trump's path to the required 270 electoral votes.
