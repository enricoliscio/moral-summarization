SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intention to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, said Trump seems more focused on settling personal scores than governing. Clinton emphasized that she and Kaine will focus on preparing to serve the American people, whereas Trump is invested in avenging personal grievances. Clinton also criticized Trump for threatening to jail her over her email scandal and for suggesting he might not concede the election, saying these actions undermine democratic traditions and constitutional freedoms. Clinton spent part of her rally in Pittsburgh making a case for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Republican Pat Toomey. Democrats believe McGinty's win is crucial to retaking control of the Senate and providing Clinton with a friendlier Congress.
