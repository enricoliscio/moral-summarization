SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intent to sue women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Clinton argued that Trump is more focused on avenging personal grievances than governing, whereas she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are invested in preparing to serve the American people. Trump's remarks, made at the Gettysburg Civil War battlefield, demonstrate a disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections, Clinton said. She emphasized that failing to concede election results, as Trump suggested, is a hallmark of dictatorship, not leadership. Clinton also criticized Trump's repeated calls to jail her, saying that in America, we have laws, courts, and an independent judiciary. In contrast, Clinton is focused on breaking through gridlock and making a difference in people's lives, as evidenced by her support for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty. Overall, Clinton presented herself as a leader committed to democratic traditions, while Trump's actions and words demonstrate a troubling disregard for the rule of law.
