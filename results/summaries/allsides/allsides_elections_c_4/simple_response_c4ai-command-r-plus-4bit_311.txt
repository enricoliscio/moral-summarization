SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's plans for his first 100 days in office, particularly his intention to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton contrasted Trump's focus on personal grievances with her own commitment to governing and serving the American people. She emphasized the importance of accepting election results, respecting constitutional freedoms, and upholding democratic traditions, framing Trump's statements about potentially jailing her and refusing to concede defeat as dictatorial. Clinton also supported Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, recognizing the impact of down-ballot races on her potential presidency. Clinton and Kaine highlighted their own plans for governing and their commitment to the business of the American people, drawing a moral contrast with Trump's vengeful agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
