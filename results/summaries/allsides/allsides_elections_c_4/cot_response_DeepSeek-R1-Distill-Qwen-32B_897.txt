Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify the morally charged words. Words like "sue," "governing," "avenging," "grievances," "suing," "charges," "invested," "scores," "settle," "mad," "danger," "democratic traditions," "disregard," "constitutional freedoms," "protection," "leadership," "dictatorship," "independent judiciary," "gridlock," and "difference" stand out as they carry moral connotations.

Next, I'll craft a concise summary. I'll start by highlighting Clinton's main points: contrasting her approach with Trump's, focusing on his threats to sue accusers and his disregard for democratic norms. I'll mention Kaine's comments and Clinton's emphasis on the importance of constitutional values. I'll also touch on her support for Katie McGinty, showing her focus on broader policy impacts. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is succinct and retains the moral framing.
