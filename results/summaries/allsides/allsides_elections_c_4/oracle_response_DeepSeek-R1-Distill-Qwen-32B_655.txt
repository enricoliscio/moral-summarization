Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's approaches to their first 100 days. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I need to make sure to include as many as possible in the summary.

First, I should read through the article to understand the key points. Clinton is contrasting her approach with Trump's. She mentions Trump's intention to sue women who accused him, which is a strong moral statement. She also talks about leadership versus dictatorship, which is another moral point. Additionally, she brings up the issue of not conceding the election, which relates to democratic norms.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like "sue," "unwanted," "intent," "avenging," "suing," "invested," "concede," "failing," "leadership," "dictatorship," "disregard," "jailed," "jail," and "break." I'll have to structure the summary to highlight Clinton's criticism of Trump's actions, focusing on the moral implications.

I should start by stating the main contrast between Clinton and Trump. Then, mention the specific moral points she made, like suing accusers and the potential for not conceding. I'll also include her emphasis on leadership and democratic principles. Finally, I'll touch on her support for the Senate candidate as part of a broader strategy.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key moral elements. I'll make sure each point flows logically, connecting Clinton's criticisms to the moral framework she's using.

SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine criticized Donald Trump for his intent to sue women who accused him of unwanted advances, arguing he is more focused on avenging personal grievances than governing. Clinton contrasted Trump's plan to spend his first 100 days suing accusers with her own focus on preparing to address the American people's needs. Kaine added that Trump seemed personally invested in settling scores, highlighting his disregard for leadership and democratic norms. Clinton also faulted Trump for failing to commit to conceding the election, drawing a line between leadership and dictatorship. She emphasized that jailing opponents, as Trump suggested, is not how America operates, underscoring the importance of laws, courts, and an independent judiciary. Clinton further highlighted the need to break gridlock by supporting Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, whose victory could help advance her policy agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
