Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine contrasting their approach to governance with Donald Trump's. They're highlighting Trump's focus on personal grievances, like suing accusers, which is framed as vengeful and undemocratic. Clinton emphasizes her intent to work on policy from day one, contrasting with Trump's potential failure to concede, which she links to dictatorship. She also mentions Trump's disregard for constitutional norms and his threat to jail her, which she opposes, promoting the rule of law. Additionally, she supports a Senate candidate to break gridlock, showing focus on policy impact.

I should make sure to include the morally charged words: sue, unwanted, intent, avenging, suing, invested, concede, failing, leadership, dictatorship, disregard, jailed, jail, break. I'll structure the summary to highlight these points concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words.
