Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's campaigns, focusing on the moral framing. They mentioned that I should preserve the author's moral perspective. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about how Clinton and Kaine are contrasting their approach to Trump's. Clinton emphasizes her focus on governing and preparing to work, while Trump is suing accusers. She mentions the importance of leadership versus dictatorship, highlighting Trump's potential disregard for democratic norms. Also, she brings up the Senate race, showing her attention to down-ballot races.

I need to capture these points concisely, keeping the moral angle. I should mention Trump's suing women as a negative contrast to Clinton's responsible approach. Also, touch on the democratic traditions and leadership. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and preserves the moral framing.

Let me structure it: Start with Clinton and Kaine's response, contrast with Trump's actions, mention the moral implications, and end with the Senate race. That should cover the main points without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine criticized Donald Trump's focus on personal grievances, such as suing women who accused him of sexual misconduct, during their campaign stop in Pittsburgh. Clinton highlighted Trump's lack of commitment to governance, contrasting it with her and Kaine's focus on preparing to serve the American people. She emphasized the importance of democratic traditions, accusing Trump of disregarding constitutional norms by threatening to jail her for her email use and failing to commit to conceding the election. Clinton also campaigned for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, underscoring the importance of down-ballot races in advancing her policy agenda. The Clinton campaign is targeting Pennsylvania, a key state for both candidates. END OF SUMMARY.
