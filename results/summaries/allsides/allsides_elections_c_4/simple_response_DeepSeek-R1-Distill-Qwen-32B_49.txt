Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Hillary Clinton contrasting her approach with Donald Trump's. She's emphasizing his focus on personal grievances and threats to sue accusers, which she's framing as undemocratic. I should highlight the key points: Trump's suing women, Clinton's focus on governance, the mention of not conceding, and the importance of Pennsylvania. Also, she's talking about the Senate race. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral aspects are clear. Let me structure this concisely, making sure each main point is covered without extra details.

SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and Sen. Tim Kaine criticized Donald Trump for focusing on personal grievances, such as suing women who accused him of sexual misconduct, rather than governing. Clinton emphasized her commitment to starting work immediately after the election to address national priorities. She also faulted Trump for his disregard for democratic norms, including his refusal to concede and his threats to jail her. Clinton highlighted the importance of Pennsylvania in the election, as winning the state could deny Trump the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. She also supported Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, emphasizing the need for a Congress that could help implement her agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
