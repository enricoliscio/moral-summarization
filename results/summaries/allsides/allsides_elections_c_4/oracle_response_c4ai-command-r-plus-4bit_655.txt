SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine criticized Donald Trump's plans to sue women who accused him of unwanted sexual advances, suggesting he is more focused on settling personal scores than on governing. Clinton contrasted Trump's vengeful intentions with her own commitment to start serving the American people from day one. She emphasized the importance of accepting election results, portraying Trump's refusal to concede as a threat to America's democratic traditions and leadership. Clinton also highlighted the GOP nominee's disregard for constitutional freedoms and his desire to jail his opponent, herself, as an attack on America's independent judiciary. Clinton concluded by promoting Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who could help break the gridlock and advance Clinton's policy agenda if elected. This shows Clinton's awareness of the importance of down-ballot races in shaping her potential presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
