SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's, highlighting his intention to sue women who accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Clinton emphasized that Trump seemed more focused on avenging personal grievances than governing. She and her running mate, Tim Kaine, emphasized their commitment to working for the American people, unlike Trump, who appears "most personally invested in...all of the scores that he needs to settle with people he's mad at." Clinton warned that Trump's behavior poses a danger to America's democratic traditions, showing a troubling disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections. She stressed the importance of accepting election results, unlike Trump, who threatened not to concede. Clinton's focus on down-ballot races, such as Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty's campaign, demonstrates her commitment to breaking through gridlock and making a difference in people's lives.
