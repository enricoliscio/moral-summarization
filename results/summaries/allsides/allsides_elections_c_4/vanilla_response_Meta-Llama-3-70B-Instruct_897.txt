SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, spoke to reporters on their campaign plane, contrasting their approach to the first 100 days in office with that of Donald Trump. Clinton criticized Trump for threatening to sue women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances, saying he seems more intent on avenging personal grievances than governing. In contrast, Clinton and Kaine emphasized their focus on preparing to serve the American people. Clinton also touched on Trump's disregard for democratic traditions, citing his refusal to concede the election and his desire to jail her over her email controversy. At a rally in Pittsburgh, Clinton made a case for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, highlighting the importance of down-ballot races in achieving her policy agenda. The Clinton campaign is focusing on Pennsylvania, a key state that could cut off Trump's path to 270 electoral votes.
