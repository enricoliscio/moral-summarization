SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton drew a contrast between her and Donald Trump's approach to the first 100 days in office, highlighting Trump's intent to sue women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Clinton emphasized that she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, would focus on governing, whereas Trump seemed more interested in avenging personal grievances. Clinton warned that Trump's behavior poses a danger to America's democratic traditions, citing his refusal to accept election results and his disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections. In contrast, Clinton promised to uphold the laws and independent judiciary, ensuring a friendlier Congress. She also campaigned for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who could help break through gridlock and make a difference in people's lives. END OF SUMMARY.
