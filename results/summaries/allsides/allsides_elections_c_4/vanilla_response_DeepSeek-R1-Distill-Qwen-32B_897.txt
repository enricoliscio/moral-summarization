Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine addressing reporters on their campaign plane. They contrast their approach with Trump's. Trump mentioned suing women who accused him, which Clinton and Kaine criticized. They emphasized their focus on governance instead of personal vendettas.

Clinton also touched on Trump's refusal to concede in the debate, linking it to a threat to democracy. She criticized his suggestion of jailing her, highlighting the importance of the rule of law. Additionally, she supported Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, showing her interest in down-ballot races to influence policy.

I should condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the main points: the contrast between Clinton and Trump's priorities, Clinton's criticism of Trump's actions, and her focus on governance and supporting other candidates.

I need to make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it to cover each key point without getting too detailed.
