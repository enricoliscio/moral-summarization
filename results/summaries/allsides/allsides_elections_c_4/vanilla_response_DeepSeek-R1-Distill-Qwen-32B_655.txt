Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's campaign events. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Clinton and Kaine contrast their approach to Trump's, focusing on Trump's threat to sue accusers. They highlight Trump's personal grievances over governance. The article also mentions the importance of Pennsylvania in the election and Clinton's emphasis on democratic traditions and Trump's potential refusal to concede. Additionally, she supports Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning the key events: Clinton's speech on the plane, Trump's Gettysburg speech, the focus on Pennsylvania, Clinton's criticism of Trump's attitude towards democracy, and her support for McGinty. I'll keep each point brief and ensure the total word count stays under 200.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without getting too detailed. Avoiding any markdown, just plain text. I'll start with the main contrast, then move to Pennsylvania's significance, followed by the democratic tradition point, and end with the Senate candidate part.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's concise. I'll also make sure to include the necessary names and key terms like "first 100 days," "sue accusers," "Gettysburg," "constitutional freedoms," and "Katie McGinty." 

Finally, I'll ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and adheres to the user's formatting instructions.
