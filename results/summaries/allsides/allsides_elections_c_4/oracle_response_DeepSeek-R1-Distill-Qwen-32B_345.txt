Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided, so I should make sure those are included.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Hillary Clinton is contrasting her approach with Donald Trump's. Trump mentioned suing women who accused him, which is a strong moral point. Clinton emphasizes her focus on governance versus Trump's personal vendettas.

I need to include words like "sue," "unwanted," "intent," "avenging," "invested," "concede," "failing," "leadership," "dictatorship," "disregard," "jailed," "jail," and "break." I should weave these into the summary naturally.

I'll start by highlighting the contrast between their approaches. Then, mention Trump's threat to sue, Clinton's focus on policy, and her criticism of Trump's potential refusal to concede. I'll also touch on her support for the Senate candidate, showing her broader strategy.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all key moral points are covered. I'll structure it to flow logically, ensuring each point transitions smoothly to the next.

Finally, I'll check that all specified moral words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone. Making sure it's clear and within the word limit is essential.

SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine criticized Donald Trump for his intent to sue women who accused him of unwanted sexual advances, framing his actions as a focus on avenging personal grievances rather than governing. Clinton contrasted Trump’s plan to spend his first 100 days suing accusers with her commitment to prepare for governing. She emphasized that Trump seemed more invested in settling scores than leading, highlighting his disregard for democratic norms. Clinton also faulted Trump for failing to concede in the event of a loss, drawing a sharp contrast between leadership and dictatorship. She criticized his calls to jail her, asserting that such actions are un-American and undermine constitutional freedoms. Clinton further focused on Pennsylvania’s significance in the election, advocating for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty to break gridlock and advance her policy agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
