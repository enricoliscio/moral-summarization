SUMMARY: 

Hillary Clinton drew a stark contrast between her approach to governance and Donald Trump's, highlighting his intentions to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton emphasized that Trump's priority seems to be avenging personal grievances rather than governing the country. In contrast, she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are focused on preparing to serve the American people. Clinton also reiterated her concerns about Trump's disregard for democratic traditions, citing his refusal to concede the election and his desire to jail his opponent. She argued that these actions are a threat to America's constitutional freedoms and protections. 

Clinton's comments came as she and Trump are competing fiercely for Pennsylvania's electoral votes. Her campaign is seeking to make inroads among college-educated women who normally vote Republican. By emphasizing Trump's personal vendettas and lack of respect for democratic norms, Clinton is trying to persuade these voters that Trump is unfit to lead the country.
