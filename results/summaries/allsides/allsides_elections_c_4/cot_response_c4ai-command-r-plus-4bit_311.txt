SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton contrasted her vision for the first 100 days in office with that of her *rival* Donald Trump, highlighting his *contention* that he would sue his *accusers*. Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, characterized Trump as more focused on *avenging personal grievances* than on governing. They criticized his *extraordinary* threat to sue women who have made charges against him, emphasizing their own commitment to serving the American people and getting to work immediately after the election. Kaine noted Trump's *personal investment* in settling *scores* with people he's *mad* at. Clinton also *faulted* Trump for refusing to concede the election, viewing it as a *troubling disregard* for democratic traditions and a *difference* between *leadership* and *dictatorship*. She highlighted his desire to *jail* his *opponent* (meaning *me*), reiterating America's commitment to *laws*, *courts*, and an *independent judiciary*. Clinton concluded by supporting Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who could help break the gridlock and advance Clinton's policy agenda. END OF SUMMARY.
