SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton drew a stark contrast between her approach to governance and Donald Trump's, highlighting his intention to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton emphasized that Trump's priorities lie in settling personal scores rather than serving the American people. In contrast, she and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are focused on preparing to lead the country from day one. Clinton also reiterated her concerns about Trump's disregard for democratic traditions, citing his refusal to concede the election and his desire to jail his opponent. She argued that these actions are a threat to constitutional freedoms and protections. Clinton's comments were part of a broader effort to appeal to college-educated women and to make inroads in Pennsylvania, a crucial state in the election. By highlighting Trump's questionable behavior, Clinton is seeking to reinforce her message that she is the only candidate fit to lead the country.
