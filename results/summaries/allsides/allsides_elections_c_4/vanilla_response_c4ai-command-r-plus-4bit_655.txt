Clinton highlighted the importance of respecting election results and the independence of the judiciary, faulting Trump for disregarding democratic traditions and constitutional freedoms. She also promoted Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Republican Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, as crucial to breaking gridlock and advancing her policy agenda.
