SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to the first 100 days in office with that of Donald Trump, highlighting his intention to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Speaking on her campaign plane, Clinton said Trump's focus on personal grievances rather than governing is a concern. She emphasized her own commitment to working on behalf of the American people, starting on January 20. Clinton also criticized Trump's comments on not conceding the election and his suggestion that she should be jailed for using a private email system, saying they demonstrate a disregard for democratic traditions and constitutional freedoms. At a rally in Pittsburgh, Clinton made a case for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Pat Toomey, and emphasized the importance of down-ballot races in achieving her policy agenda.
