SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's plans for his first 100 days in office, which included suing women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton contrasted Trump's focus on personal grievances with her own commitment to governing and serving the American people. She emphasized the importance of accepting election results and respecting constitutional freedoms, highlighting Trump's disregard for democratic traditions. Clinton also promoted the campaign of Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Republican Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, a key state for the election. Clinton framed the election as a choice between leadership and dictatorship, urging voters to consider the moral implications of their decision.
