SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton drew a stark contrast between her approach to governance and Donald Trump's intent to sue women who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Clinton emphasized that Trump seems more invested in avenging personal grievances than in leading the country. She criticized Trump's remarks at Gettysburg, where he threatened to sue his accusers, saying it's a "troubling disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections." Clinton also faulted Trump for failing to concede the election, which she equated with a "dictatorship." In contrast, Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, vowed to focus on the business of the American people, rather than settling personal scores. Clinton's speech highlighted the importance of respecting democratic traditions and the rule of law, saying "We don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary." END OF SUMMARY.
