SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's plans for his first 100 days in office, highlighting his intention to sue women who have accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Clinton contrasted Trump's focus on avenging personal grievances with her own commitment to governing and serving the American people. She emphasized the importance of accepting election results, framing Trump's refusal to concede as a threat to America's democratic traditions and a disregard for constitutional freedoms. Clinton also referenced Trump's desire to jail her, noting that such actions are not consistent with American values of laws, courts, and an independent judiciary. The article also mentions Clinton's support for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, as part of her thinking about down-ballot races that could impact her policy agenda.
