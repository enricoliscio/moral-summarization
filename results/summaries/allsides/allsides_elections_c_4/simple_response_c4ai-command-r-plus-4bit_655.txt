SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's plans for his first 100 days in office, particularly his intention to sue women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Clinton contrasted Trump's vengeful approach with her own focus on governing and serving the American people. She emphasized the importance of respecting election results and upholding democratic traditions, highlighting Trump's disregard for constitutional freedoms. Clinton also promoted the campaign of Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Republican Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania. Clinton argued that a victory for McGinty would help break gridlock and advance her policy agenda. The criticism of Trump's plans and emphasis on down-ballot races reflect Clinton's commitment to moral principles of justice, equality, and respect for democratic institutions.
END OF SUMMARY.
