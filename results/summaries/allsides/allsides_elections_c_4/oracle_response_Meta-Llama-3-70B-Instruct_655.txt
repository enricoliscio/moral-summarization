SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton drew a stark contrast between her approach to governance and Donald Trump's, highlighting his intent to sue women who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Trump's remarks, made at the Gettysburg Civil War battlefield, revealed a desire for avenging personal grievances rather than leading the country. Clinton, on the other hand, emphasized her commitment to working for the American people, underscoring the difference between leadership and dictatorship. She criticized Trump's disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections, particularly his suggestion that she should be jailed for using a private email system. Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, echoed her concerns, noting that Trump seemed most invested in settling scores with those he's mad at. By contrast, Clinton and Kaine vowed to break through gridlock and make a difference in people's lives. END OF SUMMARY.
