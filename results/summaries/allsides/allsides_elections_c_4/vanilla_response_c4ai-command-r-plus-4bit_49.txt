SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's focus on avenging personal grievances rather than governing during his first 100 days in office. Clinton contrasted Trump's agenda with her own, emphasizing her respect for America's democratic traditions and the rule of law. Clinton also highlighted the importance of down-ballot races, such as the Pennsylvania Senate race, in providing her with a supportive Congress to help enact her policy agenda. She emphasized that she would get to work immediately after the election to prepare for the presidency. Kaine added that Trump seemed more invested in settling personal scores than in governing. The Clinton campaign is trying to appeal to college-educated women who usually vote Republican, and Clinton emphasized the difference between "leadership and dictatorship" in accepting election results. She also criticized Trump's disregard for constitutional freedoms and his threat to jail his opponent.
END OF SUMMARY.
