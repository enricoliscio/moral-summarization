SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton contrasted her approach to governing with Donald Trump's, accusing him of being more intent on avenging personal grievances than leading the country. Trump's threat to sue women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances was a prime example, Clinton argued. In contrast, Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, emphasized their focus on preparing to serve the American people from day one. Clinton warned that Trump's behavior, including his refusal to concede the election and his disregard for constitutional freedoms, poses a danger to America's democratic traditions and amounts to a form of dictatorship. She also criticized Trump's desire to jail her over her email controversy, highlighting the importance of upholding the rule of law. Meanwhile, Clinton and Kaine campaigned in Pennsylvania, a crucial state in the election, and emphasized the need to break through gridlock and make a difference in people's lives.
