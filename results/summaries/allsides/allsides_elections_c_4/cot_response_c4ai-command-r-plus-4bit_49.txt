SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Republican rival Donald Trump's plans for his first 100 days in office, specifically his intention to sue his accusers of sexual misconduct. Clinton contrasted Trump's focus on settling personal grievances with her own agenda of governing and serving the American people. She emphasized the importance of leadership and respecting democratic traditions, highlighting Trump's disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections, including his refusal to concede the election and his threat to jail his opponent. Clinton also devoted time to supporting down-ballot races, acknowledging the difference a victory or defeat could make in her ability to enact her policy agenda with a friendly Congress.
