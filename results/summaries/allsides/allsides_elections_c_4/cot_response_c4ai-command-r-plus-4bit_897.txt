SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, criticized Donald Trump's agenda for his first 100 days in office, particularly his intention to sue his female accusers. They contrasted this with their own focus on governing and serving the American people. Clinton emphasized Trump's disregard for democratic traditions and constitutional freedoms, including his refusal to concede the election and his threat to jail his rival. She also highlighted the importance of down-ballot races, such as the Pennsylvania Senate race, in providing her with a friendly Congress to help break gridlock and make a difference in people's lives. Kaine added that Trump seemed more invested in settling personal scores than in governing. The Clinton campaign is targeting college-educated women and highlighting Trump's troubling disregard for leadership and the independent judiciary. END OF SUMMARY.
