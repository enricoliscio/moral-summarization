Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, contrasting their approach to the first 100 days in office with Donald Trump's. They're highlighting Trump's focus on suing women who accused him of sexual misconduct instead of governing. Clinton emphasizes that she and Kaine will focus on policy and preparing to serve, while Trump seems more interested in personal vendettas.

Also, the article mentions that both campaigns are focusing on Pennsylvania, which is crucial for the electoral votes. Clinton is also talking about Trump's potential refusal to concede, which she sees as undemocratic, and his suggestion to jail her, which she criticizes as un-American.

Additionally, Clinton is supporting the Democratic Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Katie McGinty, as part of her strategy to influence down-ballot races.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should focus on the key points: the contrast between Clinton and Trump's priorities, the focus on Pennsylvania, Trump's threats, Clinton's emphasis on democracy, and her support for McGinty.

Let me structure this into a concise summary, making sure to include all these elements without going over the word limit.
