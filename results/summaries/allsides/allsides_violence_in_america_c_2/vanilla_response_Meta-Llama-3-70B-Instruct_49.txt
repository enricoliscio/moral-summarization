SUMMARY:

Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond. The indictment comes after Crusius surrendered to police, saying "I'm the shooter," and allegedly targeting Mexicans. A screed published shortly before the shooting echoed President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric on immigration, leading some to blame Trump for inflaming racial tensions. Crusius drove over 10 hours to carry out the shooting, and most of the victims had Hispanic last names. Federal prosecutors are also weighing hate-crime charges against Crusius. The shooting was part of a series of mass shootings last month, sparking debate over gun control and immigration.
