Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without making it too long—under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Patrick Crusius being indicted for the El Paso shooting, which killed 22 people. He targeted Mexicans and had a manifesto blaming Hispanic immigration, which tied into Trump's rhetoric. There were other shootings in Dayton and Texas, and the political reactions, including Abbott's response and gun control debates.

Now, I need to identify the key morally charged words from the list: shooting, murder, dead, jailed, gunning, indicted, massacre, shootings, attack, targeting, inflaming, division, violence, killing, injuring, killed, wounded, firing, attacks, mistakes.

I should structure the summary to include these words. Start with the indictment, mention the massacre, his targeting Mexicans, the manifesto, the political implications, other shootings, and the political reactions.

I need to keep it concise. Maybe start with Crusius being indicted for capital murder, the massacre, targeting Mexicans, the manifesto, and the political blame. Then mention the other shootings and the political debates, including Abbott's response and the criticism.

I should avoid adding extra details not related to the moral framing. Make sure each sentence includes as many of the keywords as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft it:

Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder in the El Paso massacre, where he killed 22 people. He targeted Mexicans and wrote a manifesto blaming Hispanic immigration, which some linked to Trump's rhetoric. Other shootings followed, and political debates over gun control and immigration intensified. Abbott's response was criticized, and gun control advocates pushed for stricter laws. Crusius remains jailed, facing possible death penalty.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details. Maybe add that he surrendered and the manifesto's content. Also, mention the other shootings and their impact.

Let me try again:

Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder after the El Paso shooting that killed 22. He targeted Mexicans and authored a manifesto blaming Hispanic immigration, tying to Trump's rhetoric. This massacre, along with others in Dayton and Texas, sparked debates on guns and immigration. Abbott faced criticism for his response, and gun control advocates pushed for stricter laws. Crusius remains jailed, facing possible death penalty.

Still a bit short. Let me add more details about the manifesto and the aftermath.

Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder in the El Paso massacre that left 22 dead. He targeted Mexicans and authored a manifesto blaming Hispanic immigration, which some tied to Trump's rhetoric. This attack, along with others in Dayton and Texas, fueled debates on gun control and immigration. Abbott's response was criticized, and gun control advocates pushed for stricter laws. Crusius remains jailed, facing possible death penalty.

Hmm, that's better. I think this captures the main points with the moral framing words. Let me check the word count—it's under 200, so that's good.

I think this should meet the user's requirements. They wanted a summary preserving the moral framing, using as many of the specified words as possible. I made sure to include words like massacre, targeted, manifesto, rhetoric, debates, etc. It's concise and covers the key events and their moral implications.
