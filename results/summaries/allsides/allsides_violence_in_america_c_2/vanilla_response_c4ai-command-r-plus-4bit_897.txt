SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man from Allen, Texas, was indicted on one count of capital murder in connection with the mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who is currently jailed without bond. The indictment comes as a response to the shooting, which was the first in a series of mass shootings last month that left dozens dead and brought the debate over guns and immigration to the forefront of American politics. Authorities believe Crusius drove over 10 hours from his hometown to carry out the shooting, targeting Mexicans. Court documents allege that Crusius was the author of a screed published before the shooting that echoed President Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration. The El Paso community has held vigils for the victims, and survivors of the attack have protested for gun control and against Trump's inflammatory language. The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has faced criticism for his response to the attack and has resisted calls for new gun control measures.
