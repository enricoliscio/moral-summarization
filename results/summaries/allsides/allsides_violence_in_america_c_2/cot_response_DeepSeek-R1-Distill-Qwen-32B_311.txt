Alright, I need to tackle this query. The user has provided a news article and specific instructions. They want me to first identify morally framed single words and then summarize the article, preserving those moral frames. 

First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the context. It's about Patrick Crusius, the El Paso shooting, and the aftermath. The user wants me to extract morally framed words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "massacre," "invasion," "stoking," "division," "hate," etc., stand out as they imply judgment or evaluation.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture the key points: the indictment, the motives, the political reactions, and the broader implications on gun control and immigration. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the indictment, moving to the attack details, political responses, and the ongoing debates.

I should ensure the summary is concise yet comprehensive, highlighting the moral aspects without being too verbose. I'll also check that the summary doesn't include any markdown and stays within the word limit. Finally, I'll make sure to present the identified words in the specified format before the summary.

**SUMMARY:**  
A man accused of the El Paso Walmart massacre, Patrick Crusius, was indicted for capital murder. Prosecutors seek the death penalty, while his defense vows to use "every legal tool" to prevent execution. Crusius allegedly targeted Mexicans, as indicated by a screed he wrote before the attack, which echoed President Trump's immigration rhetoric. Trump denied stoking division. The shooting, which killed 22, including eight Mexican nationals, sparked national debates over guns and immigration. Less than 24 hours later, a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine, followed by another in West Texas. These events fueled anger among gun control and immigration advocates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott faced criticism for resisting new gun-control measures, while Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick drew NRA ire for supporting background checks. Survivors of the El Paso attack held vigils, while Crusius remained in solitary confinement on suicide watch. The mass shootings reignited debates over gun control, immigration, and political division.
