SUMMARY: A man accused of gunning down people and committing murder at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, resulting in a massacre that left 22 dead, has been indicted for capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen, Texas, was indicted on one count of capital murder and is jailed without bond. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The attack, which occurred on August 3, 2019, was motivated by Crusius' targeting of Mexicans and inflammatory rhetoric about immigration. He drove over 10 hours from his hometown to carry out the shooting in a largely Latino city. The El Paso shooting was one of several recent mass shootings that brought the debate over guns and immigration to the forefront of American politics. Less than 24 hours after the El Paso shooting, another shooting in Dayton, Ohio, left nine dead and 27 injured. These tragic events have fueled anger and political blowback, with calls for stronger gun control measures and background checks. Texas Governor Greg Abbott acknowledged mistakes were made in his response to the attacks and has released recommendations for firearm safety.
END OF SUMMARY.
