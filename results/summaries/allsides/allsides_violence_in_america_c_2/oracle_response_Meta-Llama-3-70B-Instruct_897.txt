SUMMARY: 

Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. The massacre, which was the first in a series of mass shootings last month, brought the debate over guns into the center of American politics. Crusius, who remains jailed without bond, surrendered to police after the attack, saying "I'm the shooter," and was targeting Mexicans. Prosecutors alleged that Crusius was the author of a screed published shortly before the shooting that said it was "in response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas," parroting some of President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration. The recent mass violence has fueled anger among gun control and immigration advocates, and caused political blowback. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has resisted calls to convene an emergency special session to vote on new gun-control measures, and his recommendations for firearm safety have been criticized as insufficient.
