SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man from Allen, Texas, was indicted for capital murder and is facing the death penalty for the mass shooting that took place in El Paso, Texas, on August 3, 2019. The shooting left 22 people dead and was fueled by Crusius' racist and xenophobic beliefs, as he targeted Mexicans and Hispanics. The indictment comes as no surprise given the severity of the crime and the growing political and racial tensions in the country. What is surprising, and deeply disturbing, is that Texas Governor Greg Abbott's response to the indictment was simply "good." Abbott has previously made tone-deaf comments about the shooting and has resisted calls for stricter gun control measures, instead focusing on voluntary background checks. The El Paso shooting was one of several mass shootings that took place last month, bringing the issue of gun control and the moral responsibility of politicians who do nothing about it back into the spotlight. The moral implications of Abbott's inaction and dismissive attitude towards the shooting are deeply concerning and raise questions about his commitment to protecting the lives of his constituents. END OF SUMMARY.
