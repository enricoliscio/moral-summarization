SUMMARY:
A Texas grand jury has indicted Patrick Crusius, 21, for capital murder in connection with the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 dead, mostly Hispanic individuals. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, which Crusius' defense lawyers vow to fight. The attack was fueled by Crusius' divisive and hateful ideology, which parroted President Trump's rhetoric on immigration, leading many to blame Trump for inflaming racial tensions. The massacre was followed by other mass shootings, fueling anger among gun control and immigration advocates. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has faced criticism for his response, including a fundraising mailer that encouraged supporters to "take matters into our own hands" and "DEFEND" Texas. Abbott's recent firearm safety recommendations have been deemed insufficient by Democrats and gun-control groups. The debate over guns and immigration continues to divide the country. END OF SUMMARY.
