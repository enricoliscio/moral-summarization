SUMMARY: A Texas man accused of killing 22 people in an August shooting at an El Paso Walmart has been indicted on one count of capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen, Texas, was indicted by an El Paso grand jury on Thursday and is being held without bond. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The shooting, which left 22 people dead and dozens more injured, was allegedly motivated by hatred towards Hispanics and Mexicans. Crusius allegedly drove over 10 hours from his hometown to carry out the attack and surrendered to police after the shooting, claiming responsibility. The massacre sparked outrage and brought attention to divisive political rhetoric and the ongoing debate over gun control in the United States. Federal prosecutors are considering hate-crime charges, which could also carry the death penalty. The indictment comes amid a string of mass shootings across the country, including subsequent attacks in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other politicians have faced criticism for their responses to the shootings, with some calling for stricter gun control measures and mandatory background checks.
