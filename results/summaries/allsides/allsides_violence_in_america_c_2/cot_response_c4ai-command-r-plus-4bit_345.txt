SUMMARY:
A man accused of carrying out a massacre at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, resulting in the death of 22 people, has been indicted for capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, was jailed without bond and is facing the death penalty. Prosecutors alleged that Crusius surrendered after the attack, claiming he was targeting Mexicans. The attack has brought moral outrage, with El Paso residents, protesters, and Democrats blaming President Trump for his divisive rhetoric on immigration, inflaming political and racial tensions across the country. Trump has denied these accusations, claiming he does not stoke division and violence. Crusius' defense lawyers are working to prevent their client from being executed. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the indictment with support, simply tweeting "good." However, Abbott has also faced moral criticism for his response to the tragedy, acknowledging "mistakes were made" in a fundraising mailer sent after the attack. Abbott has resisted calls for an emergency session to address gun control and instead focused on voluntary background check recommendations, which critics deemed insufficient. The El Paso shooting was one of several recent mass shootings, including incidents in Dayton, Ohio, and West Texas, that have fueled anger and brought moral scrutiny to issues of gun control and immigration.
