SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond. The indictment comes after Crusius surrendered to police, saying "I'm the shooter," and allegedly targeting Mexicans. A screed published before the shooting echoed President Trump's divisive rhetoric on immigration, leading to blame from El Paso residents and Democrats. Federal prosecutors are considering hate-crime charges against Crusius, which could also carry the death penalty. The El Paso shooting was followed by other mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas, fueling anger among gun control and immigration advocates. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has faced criticism for not taking stronger action on gun control, including from Democrats and the NRA. END OF SUMMARY.
