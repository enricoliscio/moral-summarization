SUMMARY: A man accused of gunning down people and committing murder at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, was indicted for capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen, Texas, was indicted on one count of the mass shooting that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond. The indictment states that Crusius was targeting Mexicans and that his actions were in response to the "Hispanic invasion of Texas." This shooting was one of several recent mass shootings that have brought the debate over guns and immigration to the forefront of American politics. The attack in El Paso was followed by similar shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and in Midland and Odessa, Texas, which left dozens dead and injured. These violent attacks have caused widespread anger and political backlash, with many calling for stronger gun control measures and background checks. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has resisted calls for an emergency special session on gun control, instead focusing on voluntary background checks for private gun sellers. The El Paso shooting and Crusius' indictment highlight the moral issues at stake in the ongoing debate over gun control and immigration policies in the United States.
