SUMMARY:
Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder in connection with the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 dead, mostly Hispanics and Mexican nationals. The attack was fueled by Crusius' divisive and inflammatory rhetoric, parroting President Trump's views on immigration. Trump has denied stoking division and violence, but many blame him for inflaming political and racial tensions. Crusius drove 10 hours to target Mexicans, and his actions have sparked anger among gun control and immigration advocates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the indictment with a simple "good," but has resisted calls for stricter gun control measures, instead proposing voluntary background checks, which Democrats and gun-control groups deem insufficient. The massacre has fueled a national debate on guns and immigration, with many calling for action to prevent similar tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
