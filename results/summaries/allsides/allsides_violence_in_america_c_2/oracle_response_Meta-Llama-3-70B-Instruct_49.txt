SUMMARY: 

Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. The massacre, which was the first in a series of mass shootings last month, has reignited the debate over guns in American politics. Crusius, who remains jailed without bond, surrendered to police after the attack, saying "I'm the shooter," and was targeting Mexicans. Prosecutors alleged that Crusius was the author of a screed published shortly before the shooting, which parroted some of President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration, leading to accusations that Trump's words inflamed political and racial tensions throughout the country. El Paso prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who could also face hate-crime charges. The recent mass violence has fueled anger among gun control and immigration advocates, and caused political blowback.
