SUMMARY: A man accused of gunning down people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, was indicted for capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen, Texas, was indicted on one count of capital murder in connection with the August mass shooting that left 22 dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond. The massacre was the first in a series of mass shootings that brought the debate over guns to the forefront of American politics once again. Survivors of the attack have held vigils around El Paso, including outside the jail where Crusius has been kept isolated from other prisoners, on suicide watch. The recent mass violence has fueled anger among gun control advocates and caused political blowback. Texas Governor Greg Abbott acknowledged that mistakes were made in his response to the shooting and released a list of gun safety recommendations, but resisted calls for an emergency special session to vote on new gun-control measures. The recommendations were criticized as insufficient by gun-control advocates.
END OF SUMMARY.
