Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions. Let me break it down.

First, the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all single words that are morally framed in the text.

The article is about Patrick Crusius, the El Paso mass shooter. It details the indictment, the context of the shooting, the political reactions, and the aftermath.

For step one, I need to find all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative moral connotation. Let me go through the article and pick them out.

Words like "mass shooting," "capital murder," "indicted," "dead," "jailed," "seeking the death penalty," "execute," "invasion," "divisive," "blame," "inflaming," "tensions," "suicide watch," "gun control," "insufficient," "killed," "injured," "mistakes," "take matters into our own hands," "DEFEND," "voluntarily," "private sales," "background checks," "resistance," "anger," "political blowback," "racist," "hate crime," "targeting," "massacre," "innocents," "senseless violence," "deaths," "carnage," "failure," "protect," "failure," "public safety," "lives," "horrifying," "tragedy," "impact," "grief," "sorrow," "healing," "action," "change," "proactive," "responsible," "address," "flaws," "system," "failure," "public," "failure," "accountability," "transparency," "failure,"
