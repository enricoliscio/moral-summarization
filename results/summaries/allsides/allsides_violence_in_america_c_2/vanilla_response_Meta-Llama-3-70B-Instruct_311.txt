SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond. The indictment comes after Crusius surrendered to police, saying "I'm the shooter," and allegedly targeting Mexicans. A screed published before the shooting echoed President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric on immigration, leading to accusations that Trump's words contributed to the attack. The shooting was followed by two more mass shootings in Ohio and West Texas, fueling anger among gun control and immigration advocates. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has resisted calls for new gun-control measures, instead proposing to make voluntary background checks easier for private sellers. Democrats and gun-control groups have criticized Abbott's recommendations as insufficient. END OF SUMMARY.
