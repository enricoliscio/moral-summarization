SUMMARY: 

Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. The attack was motivated by a racist and xenophobic ideology, with Crusius targeting Mexicans and publishing a screed that echoed President Trump's divisive rhetoric on immigration. The shooting was followed by two more mass shootings in Ohio and West Texas, fueling anger among gun control and immigration advocates. While Texas Governor Greg Abbott has acknowledged "mistakes were made" in his response to the attack, he has resisted calls to convene an emergency special session to vote on new gun-control measures. Instead, he has proposed making voluntarily background checks easier for private sellers, which has been criticized as insufficient by Democrats and gun-control groups. The El Paso shooting has brought the debate over guns and immigration to the forefront of American politics, with many blaming Trump's rhetoric for inflaming political and racial tensions.
