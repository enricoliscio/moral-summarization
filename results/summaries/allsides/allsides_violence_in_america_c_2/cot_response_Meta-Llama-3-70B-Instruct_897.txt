SUMMARY:
Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. The attack was motivated by Crusius' desire to target Mexicans, and his screed parroted President Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration. El Paso residents, protesters, and Democrats have blamed Trump for inflaming political and racial tensions throughout the country. The massacre was followed by two more mass shootings, fueling anger among gun control and immigration advocates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has been criticized for resisting calls to convene an emergency special session to vote on new gun-control measures, and his firearm safety recommendations have been deemed insufficient. The recent mass violence has brought the debate over guns into the center of American politics. END OF SUMMARY.
