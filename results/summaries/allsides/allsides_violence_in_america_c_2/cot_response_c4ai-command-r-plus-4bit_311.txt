SUMMARY: A man accused of gunning down people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, has been indicted for capital murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Patrick Crusius, who is accused of killing 22 people in the August attack. The indictment comes as a moral relief to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who simply tweeted "good." The massacre was the first in a series of mass shootings that brought the debate over guns and immigration to the forefront of American politics. Crusius' defense lawyers are working to prevent their client from being executed. Prosecutors have alleged that Crusius was targeting Mexicans and that he authored a screed parroting President Trump's divisive rhetoric about an "invasion" of Texas. This immoral screed has caused El Paso residents, protesters, and Democrats to blame Trump for inflaming political and racial tensions. Survivors of the El Paso attack have held vigils, mourning the loss of life and calling for justice. Less than 24 hours after the Texas shooting, a separate shooting in Dayton, Ohio, left nine people dead and 27 injured. These moral atrocities fueled anger among gun control and immigration advocates, and caused political blowback. Texas officials have acknowledged mistakes and resisted calls for gun-control measures, with Abbott's recommendations being criticized as insufficient.
