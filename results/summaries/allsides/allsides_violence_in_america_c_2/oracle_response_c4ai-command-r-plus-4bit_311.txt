SUMMARY: An indictment for capital murder was announced against Patrick Crusius, the 21-year-old man accused of the shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who is jailed without bond. The indictment comes as a response to the massacre that was the first in a series of mass shootings last month, bringing the debate over guns to the forefront of American politics once again. According to court documents, Crusius allegedly admitted to being "the shooter" and targeting Mexicans, with prosecutors alleging he authored a racist screed echoing divisive rhetoric about immigration. Crusius drove 10 hours from his hometown to carry out the attack in a predominantly Latino city, and most of the victims had Hispanic last names. Federal hate-crime charges, which could also carry the death penalty, are being considered. The El Paso shooting was followed by similar attacks in Dayton, Ohio, and in Midland and Odessa, Texas, sparking anger and political debates over gun control and immigration. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has resisted calls for an emergency session on gun control, instead focusing on voluntary background checks for private sellers.
