Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the underlying messages.

The article is about Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old accused of the El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 22 people. He's been indicted for capital murder, and Texas is seeking the death penalty. Crusius wrote a manifesto blaming Hispanic immigration, which ties into President Trump's rhetoric. There's also mention of other mass shootings in Dayton and Texas, and the political reactions, especially regarding gun control and immigration.

I should highlight the moral aspects: the targeting of a specific ethnic group, the use of divisive rhetoric, and the political response. Also, the debate over gun control and immigration is important.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the indictment, the manifesto, the connection to Trump's rhetoric, the other shootings, and the political reactions. I'll make sure to include the moral framing elements like the targeting of Mexicans, the rhetoric's impact, and the political divide on gun control.

Let me structure it: start with the indictment, mention the manifesto and its connection to Trump, the other shootings, the political fallout, and the debate over gun control measures. Conclude with the broader implications of the violence and political responses.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically and covers all the key moral points without getting bogged down in too many details.

Greg Abbott has opposed new gun-control measures, while Democrats and advocates criticize his inaction. The attacks have deepened political divides, with survivors and activists calling for accountability and change. END OF SUMMARY.
