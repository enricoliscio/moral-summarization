SUMMARY:
An accused man, Patrick Crusius, was indicted for capital murder in connection with a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who is currently jailed without bond. The indictment states that Crusius was targeting Mexicans and that his actions were in response to the "Hispanic invasion of Texas." This divisive rhetoric mirrors some of the inflammatory statements made by President Trump, leading to blame and protests directed at the president for inflaming racial tensions and stoking division in the country. Crusius's defense lawyers are working to prevent their client from being executed. The El Paso shooting was one of several recent mass shootings that have brought the issue of gun control to the forefront of American politics. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has resisted calls for an emergency session to vote on new gun control measures, instead focusing on voluntary background checks for private gun sellers. Democrats and gun control advocates have criticized Abbott's stance as insufficient in addressing the issue of gun violence. The El Paso community continues to mourn and heal from the tragic attack, with survivors holding vigils to honor the victims.
