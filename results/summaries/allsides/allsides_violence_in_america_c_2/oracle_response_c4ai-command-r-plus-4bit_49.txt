SUMMARY: An indictment for capital murder has been issued against Patrick Crusius, the 21-year-old man accused of gunning down people at an El Paso Walmart last month, killing 22 people. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who allegedly drove over 10 hours from his hometown of Allen, Texas, to carry out the attack in the largely Latino city. The massacre was followed by a series of mass shootings across the United States, bringing the debate over guns and immigration to the forefront of American politics once again. Crusius' defense lawyers plan to use "every legal tool available" to prevent their client from being executed. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has reacted to the indictment with support, while Democrats and gun-control advocates criticize his recent recommendations as insufficient in addressing the issue of gun violence. This tragic event, along with other recent mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas, has fueled anger and political blowback, with many demanding stronger actions to prevent such attacks from occurring again.
END OF SUMMARY.
