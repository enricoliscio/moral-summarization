Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Patrick Crusius, who's accused of the El Paso Walmart shooting. He's been indicted for capital murder. The key points are the attack, the number of dead, the targeting of Mexicans, the manifesto mentioning Hispanic invasion, and the political implications.

I should include words like shooting, murder, dead, indicted, massacre, targeting, violence, etc. I need to make sure these terms are in the summary. Also, the summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by mentioning the indictment, the number of dead, the targeting. Then note the manifesto and its connection to Trump's rhetoric. Include the aftermath, other shootings, and political reactions. Make sure to keep it concise and include all the moral terms without making it too long.

Let me structure it: Indictment details, targeting Mexicans, manifesto, political blame, aftermath with vigils, other shootings, political blowback, Abbott's response, and the NRA issue. Keep each point brief.

I need to ensure each morally framed word is used where appropriate without forcing them in. Let me draft it step by step, checking word count as I go.

SUMMARY:  
Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the El Paso Walmart shooting, which left 22 dead. Crusius allegedly targeted Mexicans and authored a manifesto blaming the "Hispanic invasion of Texas," echoing President Trump's immigration rhetoric. El Paso residents and Democrats have criticized Trump for inflaming division and violence. Crusius drove over 10 hours from Dallas to carry out the attack, with most victims having Hispanic last names. Federal prosecutors are considering hate-crime charges, and survivors have held vigils. The massacre, part of a series of mass shootings last month, has fueled debates over gun control and immigration. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has faced criticism for resisting stricter gun laws, while Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick drew backlash from the NRA for supporting background checks. The attacks have highlighted political and racial tensions in the U.S.  
END OF SUMMARY.
