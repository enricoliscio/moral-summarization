SUMMARY: 

Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond. Crusius surrendered to police after the attack, saying "I'm the shooter," and allegedly targeted Mexicans. A screed published shortly before the shooting parroted some of President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration. The massacre was the first in a series of mass shootings last month that left dozens dead and reignited the debate over guns in American politics. Federal prosecutors are weighing hate-crime charges against Crusius that could also carry the death penalty.
