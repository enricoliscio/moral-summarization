Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the El Paso shooting. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old from Texas, who was indicted for capital murder after the August 3 shooting at a Walmart in El Paso. The shooting resulted in 22 deaths. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, and his defense is working to prevent that. The governor, Greg Abbott, responded simply with "good" on Twitter.

The article then talks about the context of the shooting. It was part of a series of mass shootings that month, including ones in Dayton and Texas again. Crusius had written a manifesto blaming Hispanic immigration, which tied into some of Trump's rhetoric, leading some to blame Trump. However, Trump denied any responsibility.

Crusius drove from Dallas to El Paso, targeting a mostly Latino area. Eight of the victims were Mexican nationals. Federal prosecutors are considering hate crime charges. Survivors held vigils, and Crusius is on suicide watch.

The article also mentions the political fallout, with gun control advocates pushing for change, but Texas Governor Abbott resisting new laws and instead focusing on voluntary background checks. Democrats criticized his approach as not enough.

So, the main points are: Crusius's indictment, the death penalty, the manifesto, the impact on the community, the political response, and the broader context of multiple shootings.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.
