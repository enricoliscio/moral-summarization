Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. My task is to summarize the given article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They've outlined two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Looking at the article, it's about a mass shooting in El Paso, the suspect's indictment, and the broader implications, including political reactions and the debate over gun control. The user wants me to extract all single words that carry moral connotations. These are words that evoke right or wrong, good or bad, or have strong ethical implications.

I'll go through the article and pick out words like "mass shooting," "dead," "capital murder," "execute," "invasion," "divisive," "blame," "stoking," "hate crime," "suicide watch," "kill," "violence," "anger," "advocates," "blowback," "mistakes," "take matters into our own hands," "DEFEND," "insufficient." These words carry moral weight because they relate to death, justice, blame, division, hate, and political responsibility.

Next, I need to write a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes these words. The summary should capture the main points: the indictment, the suspect's targeting of Mexicans, the political and moral implications, the subsequent shootings, and the reactions from both sides regarding gun control and immigration.

I should ensure that the summary flows naturally while incorporating the identified moral terms. It's important to maintain the original moral framing, so I'll highlight the controversy around Trump's rhetoric, the push for the death penalty, and the political divide on gun control measures.

I also need to mention the other shootings in Dayton and Texas, as they're part of the context that fueled the debate. Including the reactions from Texas officials and the criticism from Democrats will show the political blowback and the stance on gun control.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit, preserving the essential moral elements from the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
A 21-year-old man, Patrick Crusius, was indicted for capital murder in connection with the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 dead. Crusius allegedly targeted Mexicans and wrote a screed blaming the "Hispanic invasion of Texas," echoing divisive rhetoric. El Paso prosecutors seek the death penalty, while his defense vows to prevent execution. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott endorsed the indictment, sparking controversy over President Trump's role in stoking division. Crusius drove 10 hours to El Paso, where most victims were Hispanic, including eight Mexican nationals. Federal authorities are considering hate-crime charges. The shooting reignited debates over gun control and immigration, with survivors holding vigils. Less than a day later, another mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine, followed by another in Texas. Gun control advocates criticized Texas Gov. Abbott's insufficient firearm safety recommendations, while the NRA opposed background checks. The recent violence has fueled political blowback and highlighted the need for stronger measures to prevent such tragedies.
