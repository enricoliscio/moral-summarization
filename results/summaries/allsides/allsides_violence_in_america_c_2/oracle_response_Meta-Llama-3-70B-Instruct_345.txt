SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old Texan, was indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 massacre at a busy Walmart in El Paso, which left 22 people dead. Crusius, who remains jailed without bond, is accused of gunning down people and targeting Mexicans. He surrendered to police after the attack, saying "I'm the shooter." Prosecutors allege that Crusius authored a screed that parroted President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration, leading to accusations that Trump's words inflamed political and racial tensions. The massacre was followed by other shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas, fueling anger among gun control and immigration advocates. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has faced criticism for not taking stronger action on gun control, and his recent recommendations were deemed insufficient by Democrats and gun-control groups. The El Paso attack has brought the debate over guns into the center of American politics, with many calling for stricter measures to prevent such violent attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
