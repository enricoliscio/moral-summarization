SUMMARY: A 21-year-old man, Patrick Crusius, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 massacre at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. Crusius, who is jailed without bond, is accused of gunning down people at the busy store, targeting Mexicans. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, alleging that Crusius surrendered to police after the attack, saying "I'm the shooter." The massacre was the first in a series of mass shootings last month that brought the debate over guns into the center of American politics. The attack was fueled by divisive rhetoric about immigration, leading to blame on President Donald Trump for inflaming political and racial tensions. The recent mass violence has fueled anger among gun control and immigration advocates, causing political blowback. The governor's response to the attack has been criticized as insufficient, with Democrats calling for stronger gun-control measures. END OF SUMMARY.
