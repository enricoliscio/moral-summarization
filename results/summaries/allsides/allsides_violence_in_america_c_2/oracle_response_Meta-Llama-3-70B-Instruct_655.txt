SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 massacre at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. Crusius, who remains jailed without bond, is accused of gunning down people at the busy store, targeting Mexicans. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, alleging that Crusius surrendered to police after the attack, saying "I'm the shooter." The massacre was the first in a series of mass shootings that left dozens dead and reignited the debate over guns in American politics. Crusius' actions were fueled by divisive rhetoric, including a screed that parroted President Donald Trump's language about immigration, leading to accusations that Trump's words inflamed political and racial tensions. The recent mass violence has sparked outrage among gun control and immigration advocates, with many calling for stricter gun laws. END OF SUMMARY.
