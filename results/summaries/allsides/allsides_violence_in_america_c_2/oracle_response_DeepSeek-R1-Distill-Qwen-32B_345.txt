Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the key points of the article. It's about Patrick Crusius being indicted for the El Paso shooting, which killed 22 people. He targeted Mexicans, as indicated by his manifesto. The author uses words like "massacre," "murder," and "violence," so I should include those.

Next, I should note that prosecutors are seeking the death penalty and that his lawyers are fighting it. Also, the political context, like Trump's rhetoric and the subsequent shootings in Dayton and Texas, which led to debates on gun control and immigration. Texas Governor Abbott's response and the criticism from Democrats are important too.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. I'll structure it to cover the indictment, the attack details, the political implications, and the aftermath, keeping the tone serious and focused on the moral aspects.

SUMMARY:  
Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which left 22 dead. Crusius, who targeted Mexicans, allegedly authored a manifesto blaming the "Hispanic invasion of Texas," echoing divisive immigration rhetoric. Prosecutors seek the death penalty, while his defense vows to use "every legal tool" to prevent execution. The attack, part of a series of mass shootings last month, reignited debates over guns and immigration. Survivors held vigils, while federal authorities consider hate-crime charges. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who initially responded with a simple "good," later acknowledged "mistakes" after sending a fundraising mailer urging supporters to "DEFEND" Texas. Abbott resisted calls for new gun-control measures, proposing voluntary background checks instead. Democrats and gun-control advocates criticized his recommendations as insufficient, amid growing anger over the shootings and their political implications.  
END OF SUMMARY.
