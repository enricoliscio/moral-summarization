SUMMARY:
Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 people dead. The attack was fueled by Crusius' hateful and divisive beliefs, which were reflected in a screed he published online. The document parroted President Trump's inflammatory rhetoric about immigration, leading many to blame Trump for stoking political and racial tensions. Crusius targeted Mexicans, and most of the victims had Hispanic last names. El Paso prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond. The massacre has sparked anger among gun control and immigration advocates, and has caused political blowback. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has been criticized for his insufficient response to the attack, including his resistance to convene an emergency special session to vote on new gun-control measures. END OF SUMMARY.
