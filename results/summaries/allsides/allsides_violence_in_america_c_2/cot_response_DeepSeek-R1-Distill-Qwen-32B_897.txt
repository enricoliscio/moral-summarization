Okay, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions. First, I should understand what they're asking for. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize the given article while preserving the moral framing the author used.

The user outlined two main steps. The first is to identify all single words that are morally framed. They want this step labeled as "STEP 1:" and each word listed with a * at the beginning on a new line. The second step is to write a summary, preserving the moral words, and it should be under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Looking at the article, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "mass shooting," "capital murder," "indicted," "kill," "execute," "defense lawyers," "prosecutors," "death penalty," "border city," "targeting," "Hispanic," "invasion," "Trump," "divisive," "inflaming," "tensions," "suicide watch," "gun control," "advocates," "blowback," "background checks," "Democrats," "insufficient," "NRA," "ire," "voluntary," "private sales," "mistakes," "take matters into our own hands," "DEFEND," "emergency," "new gun-control measures," "firearm safety recommendations," "mandatory," "private gun sales," "Democrats," "gun-control groups," "criticized," "insufficient."

Now, I need to write the summary. I should include as many of these moral words as possible without making it too long. The summary should cover the main points: the indictment of Patrick Crusius for the El Paso shooting, the moral implications like targeting Mexicans, the hate crime angle, the political reactions, and the ongoing debates on gun control and immigration.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all key moral aspects. I'll start by mentioning the indictment and the charges, then the motive, the political blame, the aftermath, other shootings, and the policy responses. I'll wrap it up by highlighting the ongoing debates and criticism of the measures.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft. Also, ensure that the moral framing words are included naturally within the summary.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to list the moral words and then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder in connection with the El Paso mass shooting that killed 22 people. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while his defense lawyers aim to prevent execution. Crusius allegedly targeted Mexicans, as indicated in a manifesto echoing President Trump’s immigration rhetoric, which critics blame for inflaming tensions. Federal authorities are considering hate-crime charges. The shooting sparked national debates over gun control and immigration. Less than 24 hours later, another mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine, followed by another in West Texas. These events fueled anger among gun control advocates and immigration supporters. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott faced criticism for a fundraising mailer encouraging supporters to “DEFEND” Texas, while resisting calls for new gun-control measures. His recommendations, including voluntary background checks, were criticized as insufficient by Democrats and gun-control groups. The moral and political implications of the shootings remain unresolved.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
