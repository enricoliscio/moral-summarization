SUMMARY:

A 21-year-old man, Patrick Crusius, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 people dead. The attack was motivated by a racist ideology, with Crusius targeting Mexicans and publishing a screed that echoed President Trump's divisive rhetoric on immigration. The shooting was followed by two more mass shootings in Ohio and West Texas, fueling anger among gun control and immigration advocates. While Texas Governor Greg Abbott has faced criticism for not taking stronger action on gun control, he has resisted calls for an emergency special session to vote on new measures. Instead, he has proposed making voluntary background checks easier for private sellers, which has been deemed insufficient by Democrats and gun-control groups. The El Paso community continues to mourn and demand action, with survivors holding vigils and calling for justice.
