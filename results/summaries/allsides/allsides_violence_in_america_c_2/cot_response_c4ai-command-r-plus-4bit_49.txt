SUMMARY: A man accused of a deadly shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, has been indicted for capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, is jailed without bond and faces the death penalty. Prosecutors say Crusius targeted Mexicans and that he was the author of a divisive screed echoing some of President Trump's rhetoric about immigration. The massacre in El Paso was one of several recent mass shootings that have brought attention to gun control and immigration debates in the US. Survivors of the El Paso attack have held vigils, while Crusius's defense lawyers are working to prevent him from being executed. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott reacted to the indictment with support, but later acknowledged mistakes in a fundraising mailer that encouraged Texans to "DEFEND" the state. Abbott has resisted calls for an emergency session on gun control, instead focusing on voluntary background checks. Critics argue his recommendations are insufficient to address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
