SUMMARY: A man accused of carrying out a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead has been indicted for capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, from Allen, Texas, is accused of targeting Mexicans in the border city and faces the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors allege that Crusius was the author of a racist screed published before the shooting that echoed divisive rhetoric about immigration used by President Trump. The shooting, along with other mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and West Texas, has fueled anger and political debates over gun control and immigration. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has resisted calls for new gun control measures, and the state's Lieutenant Governor has faced backlash from the NRA for expressing support for background checks.

END OF SUMMARY.
