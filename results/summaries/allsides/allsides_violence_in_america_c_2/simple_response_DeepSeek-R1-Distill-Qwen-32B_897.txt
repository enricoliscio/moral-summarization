Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Patrick Crusius, who was indicted for the El Paso shooting. He killed 22 people, targeting Mexicans, as per his manifesto. The moral framing here is clear: it's about hate, violence, and the impact on the community. The author also connects this to broader issues like gun control and immigration, especially tying it to Trump's rhetoric.

I should start by identifying the main elements: the indictment, the hate crime aspect, the manifesto, the political implications, and the reactions from both the governor and the public. It's important to highlight the moral stance against violence and the criticism of political rhetoric.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating the indictment, then the details of the crime, the manifesto, the political context, and the reactions. I should make sure to include how the attack affected the community and the ongoing debates about gun control and immigration.

Also, the user mentioned to use "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly. I should avoid any markdown and keep it plain text. Let me make sure all key points are covered without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the August 3 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which left 22 dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while his defense aims to prevent execution. Crusius allegedly targeted Mexicans, as indicated by a manifesto he wrote before the attack, which echoed divisive immigration rhetoric, including references to President Trumpâ€™s comments. El Paso residents and Democrats blame Trump for inflaming tensions, though he denies responsibility. Crusius, who surrendered after the attack, drove over 10 hours from Dallas to El Paso, where most victims had Hispanic last names, including eight Mexican nationals. Federal prosecutors are considering hate-crime charges. The attack, part of a series of mass shootings last month, has reignited debates over gun control and immigration. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has opposed new gun-control measures, while survivors and advocates criticize his inaction. The shootings have deepened political divisions and highlighted the need for unity and accountability.  
END OF SUMMARY.
