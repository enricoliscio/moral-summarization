SUMMARY: A man accused of carrying out a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead, has been indicted for capital murder. Patrick Crusius, 21, from Allen, Texas, was indicted on one count of capital murder and is facing the death penalty. Prosecutors allege that Crusius was targeting Mexicans and that a racist screed published before the shooting echoed divisive rhetoric used by President Trump. The attack was followed by other mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas, sparking debates over gun control and immigration. Federal prosecutors are considering hate-crime charges against Crusius, who drove over 10 hours from his hometown to carry out the attack in a predominantly Latino city. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other politicians have faced criticism for their responses to the shootings, with Abbott acknowledging mistakes in his handling of the issue.
