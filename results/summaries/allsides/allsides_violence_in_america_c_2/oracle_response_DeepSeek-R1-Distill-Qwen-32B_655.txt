Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I should include as many of those as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Patrick Crusius, who was indicted for the El Paso Walmart shooting. He killed 22 people, and the prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. He targeted Mexicans and had a manifesto blaming the "Hispanic invasion of Texas." There's also mention of other mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and West Texas, which sparked debates on gun control and immigration. Texas Governor Greg Abbott's response and the political implications are discussed.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words. The list includes words like shooting, murder, dead, jailed, gunning, indicted, massacre, etc. I should make sure to include these in the summary without changing their moral connotations.

I'll start by outlining the key events: the indictment, the number of dead, the targeting of Mexicans, the manifesto, the other shootings, the political reactions, and the criticism of Abbott's gun control stance.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. I should avoid adding any new information not present in the article and focus on the main points with the specified moral framing.

Let me structure the summary: begin with the indictment, mention the massacre, the targeting, the manifesto, the other shootings, the political debate, Abbott's response, and the criticism. I'll use the moral words where appropriate.

I should also ensure that the summary doesn't include any personal opinions but sticks to the facts presented in the article, using the moral language provided.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure the summary starts after "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, 21, was indicted for capital murder in connection with the El Paso Walmart massacre, which left 22 dead. Crusius allegedly targeted Mexicans, as indicated in a manifesto blaming the "Hispanic invasion of Texas." The shooting was part of a series of mass shootings last month, including attacks in Dayton, Ohio, and West Texas, fueling debates on gun control and immigration. El Paso prosecutors seek the death penalty, while Crusius' defense aims to prevent execution. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott supported the indictment but faced criticism for a fundraising mailer encouraging supporters to "DEFEND" Texas. Abbott's gun safety recommendations, which did not include mandatory background checks, were criticized as insufficient by Democrats and gun-control advocates. The shootings have heightened tensions over immigration and gun violence, with some blaming President Trump for inflaming division. END OF SUMMARY.
