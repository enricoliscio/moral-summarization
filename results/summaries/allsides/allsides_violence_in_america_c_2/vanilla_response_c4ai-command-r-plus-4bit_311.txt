SUMMARY: A Texas man, Patrick Crusius, has been indicted for capital murder and is facing the death penalty in connection with the mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart that left 22 people dead. Prosecutors allege that Crusius was targeting Mexicans and that a racist screed published before the shooting echoed some of President Trump's divisive rhetoric on immigration. The attack, along with other recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, has fueled anger over gun control and immigration policies and sparked political backlash. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has resisted calls for new gun control measures, instead focusing on voluntary background checks for private gun sellers. Abbott's response to the indictment was simply "good." The indictment comes as federal prosecutors consider hate-crime charges against Crusius, which could also carry the death penalty.
END OF SUMMARY.
