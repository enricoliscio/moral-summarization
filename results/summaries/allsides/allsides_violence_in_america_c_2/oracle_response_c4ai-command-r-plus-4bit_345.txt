SUMMARY: Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old man from Allen, Texas, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the mass shooting that left 22 people dead in El Paso, Texas. Crusius is accused of gunning down shoppers at a Walmart and targeting Mexicans, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty. The shooting was one of several recent mass attacks in the US that have brought the debate over guns and immigration to the forefront of American politics. The El Paso shooting, in particular, has sparked outrage due to its racist motives, with Crusius allegedly authoring a screed echoing President Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration. In response to the shooting, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has faced criticism for his handling of gun control measures and for sending a controversial fundraising mailer. The indictment of Crusius highlights the moral imperative to hold individuals accountable for their violent actions and to address the root causes of division and racism in the country.
