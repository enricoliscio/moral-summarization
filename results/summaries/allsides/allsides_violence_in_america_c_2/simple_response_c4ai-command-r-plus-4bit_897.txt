SUMMARY: A moral outrage has been committed in El Paso, Texas, as a mass shooting left 22 people dead. The accused, Patrick Crusius, has been indicted for capital murder and is facing the death penalty. This heinous act of violence was fueled by divisive rhetoric and targeted innocent people based on their race and ethnicity. It is a stark reminder of the dangerous consequences of stoking racial and political tensions. 

Crusius, who drove 10 hours to carry out this attack, surrendered to police, claiming he was targeting Mexicans. This tragic incident was soon followed by two more mass shootings in Ohio and West Texas, leaving many more dead and injured. These senseless acts of violence have sparked outrage and brought the debate over gun control and immigration to the forefront of American politics once again. 

Despite some attempts at damage control, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been criticized for his inadequate response, including a tone-deaf fundraising mailer sent shortly after the attack. The indictment of Crusius is a small step towards justice, but it cannot bring back the lives lost or heal the deep wounds inflicted on the El Paso community and the nation as a whole. 

END OF SUMMARY.
