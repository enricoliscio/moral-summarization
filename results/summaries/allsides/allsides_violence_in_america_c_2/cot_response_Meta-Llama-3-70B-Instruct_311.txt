SUMMARY:
Patrick Crusius, 21, has been indicted for capital murder in connection with the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 dead. The attack was fueled by Crusius' divisive and inflammatory rhetoric, which parroted President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric about immigration. Crusius targeted Mexicans, saying it was "in response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas." The massacre has brought the debate over guns into the center of American politics, with many blaming Trump for stoking division and violence. Survivors and advocates have expressed anger over the lack of action on gun control, with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's recommendations being deemed insufficient. The attack was followed by other mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas, fueling further outrage and calls for change. END OF SUMMARY.
