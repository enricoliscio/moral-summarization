SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff fiercely defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and Republicans, citing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia as "not OK." Schiff's comments came after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Trump and GOP allies have seized on the revelation, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and Democrats for promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the integrity of the panel. Schiff has been accused of lying and leaking, and Republicans have called for his resignation, saying he has abused his power and misrepresenting information. Democrats have come to Schiff's defense, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The partisan divisions on the committee have exploded into plain sight, with Schiff vowing to move forward with the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, citing concerns that the president could be "compromised" by the Kremlin.

END OF SUMMARY.
