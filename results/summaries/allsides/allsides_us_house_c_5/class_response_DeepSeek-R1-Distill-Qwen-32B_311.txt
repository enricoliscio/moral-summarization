Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the House Intelligence Committee hearing, specifically involving Adam Schiff and the Republican push for him to step down. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included in the summary.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. Schiff is defending his leadership, criticizing Trump's campaign for contacts with Russia, which he deems "not OK." Republicans like Conaway and Turner are calling for his resignation, accusing him of misrepresenting information and advancing Putin's work. The Mueller report didn't find collusion, but Schiff continues his investigation, leading to accusations of lying and leaking from Trump.

Now, I need to make sure I include the moral words: damaged, violence (though I don't see that in the article), investigation, collusion, lying, leaking, compromised, divisions, sight, advancing, abused, misrepresenting.

Wait, the user mentioned "violence" but it's not in the article. Maybe it's a typo. I'll focus on the others. I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict, Schiff's defense, Republican accusations, and the moral implications.

I'll start by stating Schiff's defense against calls to step down, using "damaged" when mentioning the panel's integrity. Then, mention the contacts with Russia as "not OK" and the accusations of collusion. Include Mueller's findings, which exonerated Trump, leading Republicans to attack Schiff for lying and leaking. Note Schiff's plan to continue the investigation, using "compromised." Highlight the divisions in the committee and the accusations of misrepresenting and abusing power. Finally, mention the comparison to McCarthy as "advancing Putin's work" and the Democratic support against the ambush.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the necessary moral terms. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY:  
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended his leadership against calls for his resignation, accusing Republicans of defending President Trump's son's contacts with Russia as "not OK." Schiff criticized the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, asserting they were "not OK," while Republicans accused him of advancing a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the panel's integrity. Attorney General William Barr's notification that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia was seized upon by Trump and Republicans to attack Schiff, claiming he lied and leaked information. Schiff, however, plans to continue his investigation into Trump's potential "compromise" by foreign powers. The hearing highlighted partisan divisions, with Republicans like Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner accusing Schiff of misrepresenting classified information and abusing his power. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP's attacks an ambush. The moral framing underscores accusations of lying, leaking, collusion, and the potential compromise of the president, while Republicans allege Schiff is advancing Putin's interests and misrepresenting facts. END OF SUMMARY.
