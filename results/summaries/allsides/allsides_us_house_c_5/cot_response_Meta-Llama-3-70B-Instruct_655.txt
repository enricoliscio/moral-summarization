SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down, citing "not OK" contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff's past comments were criticized by Republicans, who claimed he promoted a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the "integrity" of the panel. President Trump and GOP allies seized on the revelation that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion, attacking Schiff and other Democrats who described evidence of collusion. Trump even called for Schiff's resignation from Congress, accusing him of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking". Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot". The hearing was another dramatic flashpoint for the partisan-divided committee. Schiff plans to move forward with the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, alleging the president could be "compromised" by the Kremlin. END OF SUMMARY.
