SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from Republicans, who claim he lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative about Trump's contacts with Russia. Schiff passionately pushed back, listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deemed "not OK." He criticized Republicans for downplaying the seriousness of these contacts, saying "My colleagues may think it is OK the president's son was offered dirt as part of an effort to help Trump... I donâ€™t." Schiff's defense came after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of Trump campaign coordination with Russia. Trump and GOP allies seized on this, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and Democrats. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot."

END OF SUMMARY.
