Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it again to understand the key points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article is about Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, defending himself against calls to step down. Republicans, including Mike Conaway and Michael Turner, are criticizing him for promoting a false narrative about Russian collusion. They mention that Mueller's report didn't find evidence of collusion, which Trump and his allies are using to attack Schiff. Schiff is standing firm, saying the contacts with Russia were "not OK" and plans to continue his investigation.

The moral framing here seems to be about truthfulness and integrity. Schiff is portrayed as defending the truth against Republican accusations of lies and misinformation. On the other hand, Republicans are seen as trying to undermine Schiff's credibility and the committee's integrity.

I should make sure the summary captures both sides but maintains the moral perspective presented. It's important to note that Democrats support Schiff, while Republicans are accusing him of advancing a false narrative, which could be seen as an attack on the integrity of the investigation.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and focus on the main points: Schiff's defense, Republican criticism, Mueller's findings, and the ongoing investigation. I should also highlight the moral implications, such as truth versus misinformation and the integrity of the committee.

Let me structure it step by step:
1. Schiff's defense and his stance on Russia contacts.
2. Republican criticism, including specific accusations from Conaway and Turner.
3. Mueller's report findings and their use by Trump and Republicans.
4. Schiff's plan to continue the investigation.
5. The moral framing: integrity, truth, and partisanship.

I should avoid getting bogged down in details like the specific quotes or the comparison to McCarthy, unless it's essential for the moral angle. The key is to show the conflict between Schiff's defense of the investigation and Republican accusations, highlighting the moral aspects each side represents.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes the necessary elements while preserving the original moral framing.

He criticized the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia as "not OK," emphasizing the need for accountability. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative, while Rep. Michael Turner likened him to Joseph McCarthy, suggesting he was advancing Russia's interests. Schiff's stance highlights the moral imperative of transparency and integrity in governance, countering Republican claims of misinformation. The debate underscores partisan divisions over the investigation's legitimacy and the pursuit of truth. END OF SUMMARY.
