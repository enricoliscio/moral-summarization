SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from Republicans, who claim he has lost credibility due to his past comments on Trump's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, calling them "not OK" and signaling he will fiercely defend himself. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the panel's integrity. Trump and his allies have seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, despite Republican opposition. Democrats have come to Schiff's defense, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot".

END OF SUMMARY.
