SUMMARY:
In the wake of Attorney General William Barr's notification to Congress that the Mueller investigation found no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia, President Trump and Republicans have fiercely criticized and called for the resignation of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Schiff has been accused of promoting a false narrative and damaging the integrity of the committee. Schiff, however, has defended his stance, listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deems unacceptable. He plans to continue the committee's investigation into Trump's links to Russia and potential compromising by foreign powers. The hearing witnessed dramatic exchanges between Schiff and Republican members, including Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner, who likened Schiff to Joseph McCarthy and accused him of advancing Putin's agenda. Democrats have defended Schiff, calling the Republican attack an "ambush" and a "cheap-shot." The Intelligence Committee's partisan divisions and ongoing probe into Russian meddling have been thrust into the spotlight once again.
