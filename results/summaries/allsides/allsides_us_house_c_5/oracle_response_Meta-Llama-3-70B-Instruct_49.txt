SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans, citing his concerns over the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia, which he deemed "not OK." Schiff listed these contacts, signaling he'll fiercely defend himself from the criticism. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed Schiff had lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has "damaged" the panel's "integrity." Trump and his allies have seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation did not find evidence of collusion, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats for "lying" and "leaking" information. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's "links" to Russia, alleging the president could be "compromised" by the Kremlin. Republicans interrupted the hearing, voicing their "dissatisfaction" with Schiff, with some likening him to Joseph McCarthy for "advancing" Putin's work and "abusing" his power.

END OF SUMMARY.
