SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively pushed back against calls for him to step down, defending his past comments on President Trump and his family's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed "not OK" contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, signaling he'll fiercely defend himself. Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) called for Schiff to step down, saying he had lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the "integrity" of their panel. Trump and GOP allies have seized on the revelation, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats who described what they viewed as evidence of collusion. Schiff has said he plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, alleging the president could be potentially "compromised" by the Kremlin or another foreign power. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot". END OF SUMMARY.
