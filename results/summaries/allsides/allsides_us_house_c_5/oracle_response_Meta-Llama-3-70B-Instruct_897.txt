SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down, pushing back against President Trump and Republicans who claim he promoted a "demonstrably false" narrative about Trump's links to Russia. Schiff listed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, deeming them "not OK" and signaling he'll fiercely defend himself. He criticized Trump's family and campaign, saying it's not acceptable for the president's son to be offered "dirt" as part of an effort to help Trump. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed Schiff damaged the "integrity" of the panel and called for his resignation. Trump tweeted that Schiff should be "forced" to resign from Congress, accusing him of "lying" and "leaking." Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing was marked by partisan "divisions" and "dissatisfaction" with Schiff's leadership. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's "compromised" links to Russia and financial dealings.

END OF SUMMARY.
