SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively pushed back against calls for his resignation from President Trump and other Republicans, defending his past comments by criticizing the president's family and campaign over its contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several instances of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them morally unacceptable and that they damaged the integrity of the panel. He also accused the president of unlawfully lying and leaking information. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner, interrupted the hearing to express their dissatisfaction with Schiff, with Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy and accusing him of advancing Russian President Vladimir Putin's agenda. Democrats, however, defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, which was supposed to focus on expert testimony about Putin, instead became a flashpoint for partisan divisions and interference accusations. Schiff has stated his intention to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia and potential compromising situations.
END OF SUMMARY.
