SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively pushed back at calls for him to step down from President Trump and other Republicans. He defended his past comments by criticizing the president and his family and campaign over their contacts with Russia, which he described as "not OK." Schiff signaled that he would fiercely defend himself against accusations of promoting a false narrative, stating that he believes the president's son being offered dirt by Russia is not acceptable. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner, have accused Schiff of damaging the integrity of the panel, abusing his power, and advancing Putin's work. They have called for his resignation, with Turner likening Schiff to Joseph McCarthy. Schiff, however, has stated his intention to continue the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, suggesting the president could be compromised by a foreign power. Democrats have defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap-shot."
END OF SUMMARY.
