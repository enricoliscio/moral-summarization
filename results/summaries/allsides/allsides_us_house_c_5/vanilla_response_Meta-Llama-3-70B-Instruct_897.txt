SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from Republicans, including President Trump, who claim he promoted a "demonstrably false" narrative about Trump's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, calling them "not OK." Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of damaging the integrity of the committee and called for his resignation. Trump also tweeted that Schiff should be forced to resign from Congress. Democrats, including Rep. Mike Quigley, defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing was part of the committee's ongoing investigation into Trump's links to Russia and allegations that he could be compromised by the Kremlin or another foreign power.

END OF SUMMARY.
