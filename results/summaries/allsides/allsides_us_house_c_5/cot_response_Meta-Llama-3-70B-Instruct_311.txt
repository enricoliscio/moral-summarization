SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff fiercely defended himself against calls to step down, citing "not OK" contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff's past comments were attacked by Republicans, who claimed he promoted a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the "integrity" of the panel. President Trump and GOP allies seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff was accused of "unlawfully lying and leaking" and "abusing" his power, with some Republicans likening him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." Schiff plans to move forward with the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, alleging potential "compromise" by the Kremlin or another foreign power. END OF SUMMARY.
