Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, facing calls to step down from Republicans, including the president, over his handling of the Russia investigation. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the key points and the moral language used. The author uses words like "not OK," "help," "promoting," "damaged," "lying," "leaking," "forced," "investigation," "links," "compromised," "divisions," "interference," "prematurely," "revived," "expanded," "meddling," "interrupted," "dissatisfaction," "advancing," "abused," "misrepresenting," "defense," "scorned," "ambush," and "cheapshot." These words carry moral connotations, so I need to include as many as possible in the summary without making it too long.

The main points are:
- Schiff is defending his role against Republican calls for him to resign.
- He criticized the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia as "not OK."
- Republicans like Mike Conaway accused him of promoting a false narrative, damaging the panel's integrity.
- William Barr's report found no collusion, which Trump and Republicans used to attack Schiff.
- Schiff plans to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia.
- Republicans interrupted the hearing, with some likening Schiff to McCarthy.
- Democrats defended Schiff, calling the Republican attack an ambush.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the moral terms. I should structure it to show the conflict between Schiff and Republicans, the accusations, and the ongoing investigation. Make sure to include key terms like "not OK," "promoting," "damaged," "lying," "leaking," "investigation," "links," "compromised," "divisions," "interference," "revived," "expanded," "meddling," "interrupted," "dissatisfaction," "advancing," "abused," "misrepresenting," "defense," "scorned," "ambush," and "cheapshot" where appropriate.

Let me draft the summary step by step:
1. Start with Schiff pushing back against calls to step down.
2. Mention his criticism of Trump campaign-Russia contacts as "not OK."
3. Republicans, including Conaway, accuse him of promoting a false narrative, damaging the panel.
4. Reference Barr's report and Trump's tweet attacking Schiff.
5. Schiff's plan to continue the investigation into Russia links.
6. Republicans interrupted the hearing, likening him to McCarthy.
7. Democrats defend Schiff, calling the attack an ambush or cheap shot.

Now, I'll try to weave these points together using the moral terms, ensuring the summary is concise and captures the essence of the conflict.
