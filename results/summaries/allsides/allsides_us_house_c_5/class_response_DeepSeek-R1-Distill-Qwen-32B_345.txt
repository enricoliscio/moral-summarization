Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible, which are: damaged, violence, investigation, collusion, lying, leaking, “compromised”, divisions, sight, advancing, abused, misrepresenting.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about a hearing where Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, is defending his position against calls from Republicans to step down. He's been accused of promoting a false narrative about Trump's collusion with Russia, which has damaged the committee's integrity. The article mentions the Mueller report finding no collusion, but Schiff is continuing his investigation. There's tension between Democrats and Republicans, with some Republicans likening Schiff to McCarthy, suggesting he's advancing Putin's work by abusing his power and misrepresenting information.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the listed moral terms. I should structure it to include Schiff's defense, the accusations against him, the Mueller findings, and the ongoing divisions and accusations within the committee.

I'll start by mentioning Schiff's defense against calls for his resignation. Then, note the accusations of lying and leaking, and how his investigation is seen as damaged the committee's integrity. Mention the Mueller report's findings about collusion. Highlight the ongoing investigation and the accusations of advancing Putin's work, abusing power, and misrepresenting information. Finally, note the partisan divisions and the comparison to McCarthy.

I need to ensure that each of the moral terms is included where appropriate without forcing them. The summary should flow naturally while incorporating these terms.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended his leadership against calls for his resignation, accusing Republicans of downplaying the Trump campaign's "not OK" contacts with Russia. Schiff emphasized that the president's son being offered dirt was unacceptable, while Rep. Mike Conaway accused him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the committee's integrity. The tension arose after Attorney General William Barr revealed Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and his allies seized on this, claiming exoneration and attacking Schiff for "lying" and "leaking." Schiff plans to continue his investigation into Trump's potential "compromise" by foreign powers. During the hearing, Rep. Michael Turner likened Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of advancing Putin's work by abusing his power and misrepresenting classified information. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP's actions an "ambush." The hearing highlighted the committee's deep partisan divisions, with Republicans criticizing Schiff's leadership and Democrats accusing them of cheap shots. END OF SUMMARY.
