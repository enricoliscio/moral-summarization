SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff faced calls to step down from his position amid criticism of his handling of the investigation into President Trump's links to Russia. Schiff has been accused of promoting a false narrative that has *damaged the integrity* of the panel. In response, Schiff aggressively defended himself, listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deemed inappropriate. He asserted that the president's son was offered dirt as part of a Russian effort to help Trump, a move that Schiff deemed unacceptable. The calls for Schiff's resignation came after Attorney General William Barr *revealed* that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump and Republicans have *seized* on this *claiming* it *exonerates* the president, while *attacking* Schiff and other Democrats for their previous assertions of collusion. Schiff has been accused of *unlawfully lying* and *leaking*, with Trump calling for his resignation from Congress. Republicans on the committee have also accused Schiff of *abusing* his power and advancing Putin's agenda. Democrats have defended Schiff, characterizing the GOP attack as an *ambush* and *cheap-shot*.
