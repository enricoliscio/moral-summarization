Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Adam Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is facing calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans. Schiff is defending his past comments and criticizing Trump and his family for their contacts with Russia. He listed these contacts as "not OK" during a hearing, showing he'll defend his position strongly.

Then, there's a part where Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, calls for Schiff to step down, saying Schiff has lost confidence by promoting a false narrative that damages the panel's integrity. This comes after Attorney General Barr informed Congress that Mueller's investigation didn't find evidence of coordination or conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump and his allies are using this to claim exoneration and attack Schiff and Democrats.

Schiff plans to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia, including financial ties and potential compromises. The hearing was supposed to focus on Putin but turned into a conflict, with Republicans like Rep. Michael Turner comparing Schiff to McCarthy, accusing him of advancing Putin's work and abusing his power. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP's actions an ambush.

So, the key points are:
1. Schiff is defending his position against calls for his resignation.
2. He criticized Trump's contacts with Russia as "not OK."
3. Conaway and other Republicans are accusing Schiff of promoting a false narrative.
4. Mueller's findings were used by Trump to claim exoneration.
5. Schiff intends to continue the investigation despite Republican opposition.
6. The hearing became a partisan conflict with comparisons to McCarthy and accusations of abusing power.
7. Democrats support Schiff, calling the attacks cheap shots.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these points without getting too detailed. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with Schiff's defense, the Republican criticism, the context of Mueller's report, and the ongoing conflict during the hearing, ending with the partisan divide.
