Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, facing calls to step down from President Trump and Republicans. Schiff defended his comments about Trump's campaign contacts with Russia, saying they're "not OK." He emphasized that some might think it's okay for Trump's son to receive dirt from Russia, but he doesn't. 

There's tension in the committee with Rep. Conaway and others criticizing Schiff for promoting a false narrative. They think his actions have damaged the panel's integrity. 

Then, there's context about Mueller's report not finding collusion, which Trump and Republicans used to attack Schiff. Schiff plans to continue the investigation into Trump's ties with Russia despite the backlash. 

During the hearing, Republicans interrupted, with Turner comparing Schiff to McCarthy. Democrats defended him, calling the GOP's move an ambush.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: Schiff's defense, Republican criticism, Mueller's findings, and the ongoing investigation.
