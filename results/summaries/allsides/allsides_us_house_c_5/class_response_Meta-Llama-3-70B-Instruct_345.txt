SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down, citing concerns over President Trump's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed "not OK" contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, signaling he'll fiercely defend himself. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed Schiff had lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the "integrity" of their panel. President Trump and GOP allies seized on the revelation that Mueller's investigation did not find evidence of collusion, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, allegations of being "compromised" by the Kremlin, and financial dealings. Republicans interrupted the hearing, likening Schiff to Joseph McCarthy and accusing him of advancing Putin's work, abusing his power, and misrepresenting information.

END OF SUMMARY.
