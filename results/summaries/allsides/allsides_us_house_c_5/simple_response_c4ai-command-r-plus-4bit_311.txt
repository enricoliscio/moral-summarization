SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls from President Trump and Republicans for his resignation, accusing them of promoting a false narrative of exoneration following the conclusion of Mueller's investigation. In a dramatic hearing, Schiff listed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and signaling his intention to continue the committee's investigation into Trump's links with Russia. He asserted that the president and his family's connections with Russia were not okay and that he would not tolerate such behavior. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, alleging that he had damaged the integrity of their committee by promoting false information. Other Republican members, such as Rep. Michael Turner, compared Schiff to Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive pursuit of investigations. Democrats, however, supported Schiff, dismissing the GOP attack as an ambush and standing by Schiff's decision to continue the investigation into potential compromising links between Trump and foreign powers.
