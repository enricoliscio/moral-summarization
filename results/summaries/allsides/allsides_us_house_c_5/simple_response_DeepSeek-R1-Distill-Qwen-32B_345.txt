Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee where Chairman Adam Schiff is facing calls to step down from Republicans. The key points are Schiff's defense of his investigation into Trump's ties with Russia, his criticism of the president and his family, and the Republicans' accusations against him. 

I should start by identifying the main actors: Schiff, the Republicans like Conaway and Turner, and the context of the Mueller report. The moral framing here seems to be about integrity and partisanship. Schiff is portrayed as defending his investigation against attacks, while Republicans are accusing him of misleading the committee. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll mention Schiff's defense, the contacts with Russia he highlighted, the Republicans' criticism, and the broader context of the Mueller report and the impeachment inquiry. Also, include the comparison to McCarthy and the Democrats' support for Schiff. 

I should make sure to include that Schiff is continuing his investigation despite the calls for his resignation and that the hearing was a flashpoint in the ongoing partisan conflict. The summary should reflect the tension and the moral stances of both sides: Schiff's commitment versus Republican accusations of misconduct.

Let me structure it: Start with Schiff's defense, mention the contacts with Russia, the Republicans' call for his resignation, their reasons, the Mueller report context, and the comparison to McCarthy. Then note Schiff's plan to continue the investigation and the Democrats' support. Conclude with the ongoing conflict and the hearing as a flashpoint.

I need to make sure it's concise and captures the moral elements without getting too bogged down in details. Also, avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text.

SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended his investigation into President Trump's ties with Russia during a hearing, despite calls from Republicans for his resignation. Schiff criticized the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia, calling them "not OK," and emphasized his commitment to the probe. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of advancing a "demonstrably false" narrative and undermining the committee's integrity. They also linked Schiff's actions to Russian interests, comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats, such as Rep. Mike Quigley, defended Schiff, calling the Republican criticism a "cheap-shot." The hearing highlighted the partisan divide within the committee, with Schiff vowing to continue his investigation despite GOP opposition. The debate comes amid the release of the Mueller report, which found no collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, and amid ongoing impeachment inquiries. END OF SUMMARY.
