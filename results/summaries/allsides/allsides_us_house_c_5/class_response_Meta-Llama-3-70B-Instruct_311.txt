SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down, pushing back against President Trump and Republicans who accused him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the "integrity" of the panel. Schiff listed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, describing them as "not OK" and signaling he'll fiercely defend himself. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed Schiff had lost confidence in the panel and called for his resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking. President Trump also tweeted, calling for Schiff's resignation from Congress, claiming he had spent two years "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking". Democrats came to Schiff's defense, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot". The hearing was marked by partisan divisions, with Republicans accusing Schiff of advancing Putin's work and misrepresenting information from classified sessions.
