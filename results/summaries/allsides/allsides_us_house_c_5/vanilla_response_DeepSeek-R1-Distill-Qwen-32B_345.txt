Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, facing calls to step down from Republicans, including President Trump. Schiff defended his position by criticizing Trump's campaign contacts with Russia, which he called "not OK." He emphasized that while some might think it's acceptable, he doesn't. 

Rep. Mike Conaway called Schiff's narrative "demonstrably false" and damaging to the panel's integrity. This happened after Attorney General Barr informed Congress that Mueller found no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Trump and Republicans used this to attack Schiff and Democrats, with Trump even tweeting for Schiff's resignation.

Schiff plans to continue the investigation into Trump's ties with Russia. The hearing was interrupted by Republicans, with Rep. Michael Turner comparing Schiff to McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP's actions an ambush.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Schiff's defense, Republican criticism, Mueller's findings, Trump's call for resignation, Schiff's plans, and the hearing interruptions. I'll make sure to include all these elements without exceeding the word limit.
