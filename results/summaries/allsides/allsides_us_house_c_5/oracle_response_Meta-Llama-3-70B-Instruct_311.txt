SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down, citing concerns over President Trump's campaign contacts with Russia, which he deemed "not OK." Schiff's comments came after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of Trump campaign coordination with Russia. Trump and GOP allies seized on the revelation, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and Democrats for promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the panel's integrity. Schiff vowed to continue the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, alleging potential compromise by the Kremlin. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of lying and leaking, while Democrats defended Schiff against what they saw as a GOP "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing highlighted partisan divisions and interference in the committee's investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
