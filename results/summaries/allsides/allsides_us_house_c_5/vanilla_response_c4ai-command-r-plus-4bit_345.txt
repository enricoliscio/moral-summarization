SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls from President Trump and Republicans for him to step down, citing his past comments about the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed instances of these contacts during an Intelligence Committee hearing and asserted that they were "not OK," indicating his intention to continue the committee's investigation into Trump's links to Russia. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a false narrative that damaged the committee's integrity. Other Republicans also voiced their dissatisfaction with Schiff, with Rep. Michael Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats supported Schiff, dismissing the GOP attack as an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, became another partisan flashpoint for the committee.
