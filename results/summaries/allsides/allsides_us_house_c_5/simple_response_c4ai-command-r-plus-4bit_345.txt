SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls from President Trump and Republicans for him to step down, citing his past comments on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed instances of the Trump campaign's interactions with Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and that they damaged the integrity of the panel. He criticized Trump, his family, and his campaign, asserting that they were offered dirt by Russia and that such actions were not okay. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a false narrative. Schiff, however, maintained his stance and plans to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia. Republicans interrupted the hearing to express their dissatisfaction with Schiff, with Rep. Michael Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an ambush and a cheap shot. Schiff's refusal to back down and his passionate defense of his position showcase his commitment to upholding moral standards and exposing the truth, despite intense pressure and criticism from opposing parties.
