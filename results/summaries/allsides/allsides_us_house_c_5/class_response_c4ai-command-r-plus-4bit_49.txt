SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls for his resignation from President Trump and other Republicans, accusing him of promoting a false narrative about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff listed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and signaling his intention to continue the investigation into Trump's links to Russia and potential compromising by foreign powers. He described the president's son being offered dirt as part of an effort to help the campaign as unacceptable. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, arguing that he had damaged the integrity of the committee by promoting a false narrative. Other Republicans, such as Rep. Michael Turner, compared Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of advancing Putin's agenda and abusing his power. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an ambush and a cheap shot. The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead became a flashpoint for partisan divisions and accusations of misconduct. Schiff has vowed to continue his investigation into Trump's Russia links and potential compromising, despite the Mueller report's conclusion of no evidence of collusion.
END OF SUMMARY.
