SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls from President Trump and Republicans for him to step down, citing his past comments about the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed instances of these contacts, stating that he found them unacceptable and signaling his commitment to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia and potential "compromise" by foreign powers. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a false narrative that has damaged the committee's integrity. Republicans, including Rep. Michael Turner, interrupted the hearing to express their dissatisfaction with Schiff, with Turner likening him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, meant to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead became another partisan flashpoint, highlighting the committee's divisions and Schiff's determination to continue his investigation despite accusations of abuse of power and misrepresentation.
END OF SUMMARY.
