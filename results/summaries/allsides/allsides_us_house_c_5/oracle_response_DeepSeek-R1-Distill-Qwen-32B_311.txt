Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, defending his position against calls for him to step down. Republicans like Mike Conaway and Michael Turner are criticizing him, saying he's promoting a false narrative and damaging the committee's integrity. Schiff is pushing back, emphasizing that contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia are "not OK." He's continuing his investigation into Trump's links with Russia, which some Republicans see as advancing Putin's interests. The article also mentions the Mueller report findings, which didn't find collusion but Schiff is still pursuing the investigation. Democrats are supporting Schiff, calling the Republican attacks an ambush.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words listed are: ok, help, promoting, damaged, lying, leaking, forced, investigation, links, compromised, divisions, interference, prematurely, revived, expanded, meddling, interrupted, dissatisfaction, advancing, abused, misrepresenting, defense, scorned, ambush, cheapshot.

I'll start by outlining the key events and then incorporate the moral terms. Schiff is defending his role against Republicans who say he's promoting a false narrative (promoting, damaged). He's emphasizing that Trump's contacts with Russia are not OK (ok). He's continuing his investigation (investigation) into links (links) and possible compromise (compromised). Republicans are dissatisfied (dissatisfaction) and interrupted the hearing to voice their displeasure (interrupted). They accused him of advancing Putin's work (advancing), abusing power (abused), and misrepresenting information (misrepresenting). Democrats defend him, calling the attacks an ambush (ambush) and cheap shot (cheapshot).

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of these terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with Schiff's defense, Republican criticisms, his response, and the ongoing investigation with support from Democrats.

Let me draft the summary:

Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, defended his role against Republican calls for his resignation, emphasizing that contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia were "not OK." Republicans, like Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the committee's integrity. Schiff, however, continued his investigation into Trump's links with Russia, arguing that the president could be compromised by foreign powers. During a hearing, Republicans interrupted to express dissatisfaction, with Michael Turner likening Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of advancing Putin's interests and misrepresenting classified information. Schiff's Democratic allies defended him, calling the GOP's attacks an ambush and a cheap shot. The partisan divisions within the committee remain sharp as Schiff pushes forward with his investigation despite Republican accusations of abuse of power and misleading the public.

I think this captures the moral framing using many of the specified words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. Looks good. Now, I'll present it as the summary.
