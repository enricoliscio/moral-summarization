SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans, citing his concerns over the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia as "not OK." Schiff listed these contacts, which he believes damaged the integrity of the committee. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative, which has led to divisions within the panel. The president and his allies have seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff has been accused of lying and leaking, and Republicans have called for his resignation from Congress. Democrats have come to Schiff's defense, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The committee's investigation into Trump's links to Russia continues, despite allegations of abuse of power and misrepresentation of information.

END OF SUMMARY.
