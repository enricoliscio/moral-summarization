SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls from President Trump and Republicans for him to step down, citing his past comments on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed instances of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and signalling his commitment to continue the committee's investigation into Trump's links to Russia and potential compromise by foreign powers. He accused the president and his family of inappropriate conduct and criticized their contacts with Russia during the 2016 election. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, alleging that he promoted a false narrative that damaged the integrity of the committee. Other Republicans, including Rep. Michael Turner, joined in criticizing Schiff, with Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, dismissing the GOP attack as an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead became a partisan clash over Schiff's chairmanship and the committee's investigation.
