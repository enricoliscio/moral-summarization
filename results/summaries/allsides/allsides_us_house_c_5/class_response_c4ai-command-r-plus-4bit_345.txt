SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is facing calls to resign from his position by President Trump and other Republicans, who accuse him of promoting a false narrative of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. In a dramatic hearing, Rep. Mike Conaway argued that Schiff has damaged the integrity of the committee by advancing a "demonstrably false" narrative. Schiff vigorously defended himself, listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deems unacceptable and suggesting that Trump and his family may be "compromised" by a foreign power. Other Republican members also voiced their dissatisfaction with Schiff, with Rep. Michael Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive investigations. Democrats have defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead highlighted partisan divisions and accusations of abuse of power and misrepresenting information.
