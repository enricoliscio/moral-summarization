SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from Republicans, who accused him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has "damaged" the panel's "integrity". Schiff pushed back, listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deemed "not OK", and signaled he'll fiercely defend himself. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed Schiff had lost confidence in the panel and should resign. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "lying" and "leaking" and claiming the Mueller investigation's findings exonerated him. Democrats came to Schiff's defense, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot". Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's "links" to Russia and allegations the president could be "compromised" by the Kremlin. The hearing highlighted the committee's deep "divisions" and partisan tensions.

END OF SUMMARY.
