SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff pushed back against calls for him to step down from leading the investigation into President Trump's links to Russia. Schiff defended his past comments, listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deemed "not OK." Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the panel's integrity. The president also tweeted that Schiff should be forced to resign from Congress. Schiff plans to continue the investigation, which Republicans claim is unnecessary after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot."

END OF SUMMARY.
