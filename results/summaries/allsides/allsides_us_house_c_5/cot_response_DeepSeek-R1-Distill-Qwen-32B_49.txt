Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure to follow, so I should make sure to adhere to that.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "pushed back," "defending," "aggressively," "lights into," "contacts," "not OK," "fiercely defend," "end," "losing," "demonstrably false," "narrative," "damaged," "integrity," "exonerates," "lying," "leaking," "resign," "abused," "misrepresenting," "ambush," "cheap-shot." I'll list these each with a *.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Schiff's defense, the contacts with Russia, Conaway's call for resignation, Barr's notification, Trump's exoneration claim, Schiff's plans, the hearing's drama, Turner's comparison to McCarthy, and Democratic support.

I'll make sure to include the moral words where appropriate, like "pushed back," "defending," "contacts," "not OK," "fiercely defend," "demonstrably false," "exonerates," "lying," "leaking," "abused," "misrepresenting," "ambush," "cheap-shot." This way, the summary preserves the author's moral framing.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too lengthy. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and accurately reflects the article's content.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll proceed to write the step-by-step explanation and then the summary as per the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff faced calls for his resignation from Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, who accused him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the panel's integrity. Schiff defended his stance, calling out the Trump campaign's "not OK" contacts with Russia and rejecting claims that the president's son being offered "dirt" was acceptable. He emphasized his commitment to investigating Trump's links to Russia, despite Attorney General William Barr's notification that Mueller's report found no collusion. Trump and his allies seized on this to claim exoneration, with Trump tweeting for Schiff's resignation. Schiff, however, vowed to continue his probe, while Republicans like Rep. Michael Turner accused him of abusing power and misrepresenting classified information, likening him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats, including Rep. Mike Quigley, defended Schiff, calling the GOP's actions an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing highlighted the panel's deep partisan divisions.
