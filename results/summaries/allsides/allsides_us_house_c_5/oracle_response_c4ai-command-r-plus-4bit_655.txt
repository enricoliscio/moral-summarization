SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively pushed back against calls for his resignation from President Trump and other Republicans, defending his past comments by highlighting the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed instances of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, which he described as "not OK," suggesting that such actions could have compromised the president and his campaign. He argued that seeking dirt on a political opponent from a foreign power is unacceptable and damages the integrity of the committee. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner, criticized Schiff for advancing a false narrative and abusing his power, even comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. They argued that Schiff's actions were helping Russian President Vladimir Putin and promoting partisan divisions. Democrats defended Schiff, characterizing the Republican attack as an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." Schiff has indicated his intention to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia, financial or otherwise, despite the conclusion of Mueller's investigation finding no evidence of collusion. The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony about Putin, was instead marked by partisan interruptions and expressions of dissatisfaction. 

END OF SUMMARY.
