Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Adam Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article talks about Schiff being the chairman and how he's facing calls to step down from Trump and Republicans. He defended his comments by criticizing Trump's campaign's contacts with Russia. He mentioned that some might think it's okay that Trump's son was offered dirt, but he doesn't. That's a key point.

Then, Rep. Mike Conaway called for Schiff to step down, saying he's damaged the panel's integrity. This happened after Barr told Congress that Mueller didn't find evidence of collusion. Trump and his allies are using this to attack Schiff and Democrats, claiming exoneration.

Schiff plans to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia. The hearing was supposed to focus on Putin, but Republicans interrupted to express dissatisfaction. One even compared Schiff to McCarthy, which is a strong statement. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP's move an ambush.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Schiff's defense, the contacts with Russia, Conaway's call for resignation, Mueller's findings, and the ongoing investigation. I'll also note the interruptions during the hearing and the McCarthy comparison. Finally, I'll include the Democrats' support for Schiff.

Let me structure this to cover all main points without getting too detailed. Make sure to highlight Schiff's stance, Republican reactions, Mueller's report, and the committee's dynamics.

Mike Conaway accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative, damaging the committee's integrity.
