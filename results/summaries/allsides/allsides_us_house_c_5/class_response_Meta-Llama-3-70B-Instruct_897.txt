SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans, citing concerns over the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several "not OK" contacts between the campaign and Russia, signaling he will fiercely defend himself. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed Schiff had lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the "integrity" of their panel. Trump and his GOP allies seized on the revelation that Mueller's investigation did not find evidence of collusion, attacking Schiff and other Democrats who described evidence of collusion. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, alleging the president could be potentially "compromised" by the Kremlin or another foreign power. The hearing was marked by partisan divisions, with Republicans accusing Schiff of advancing Putin's work and misrepresenting information.

END OF SUMMARY.
