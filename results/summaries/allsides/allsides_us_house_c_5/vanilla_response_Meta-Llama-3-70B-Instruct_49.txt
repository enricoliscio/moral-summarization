SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff pushed back against calls for him to step down from his position, defending his past comments about President Trump and his family's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, calling them "not OK". This comes after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that the Mueller investigation did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump and GOP allies have seized on this revelation, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Republicans on the committee, including Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative and abusing his power. Democrats, however, defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot".

END OF SUMMARY.
