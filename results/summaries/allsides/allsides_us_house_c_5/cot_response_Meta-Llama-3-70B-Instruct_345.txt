SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down, citing "not OK" contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff's comments were met with opposition from Republicans, who claimed he had lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the "integrity" of the committee. President Trump and GOP allies seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion, claiming it "exonerates" Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff has said he plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, alleging the president could be potentially "compromised" by the Kremlin. Republicans interrupted the hearing, likening Schiff to Joseph McCarthy and accusing him of "abusing" his power and "misrepresenting" information. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot". END OF SUMMARY.
