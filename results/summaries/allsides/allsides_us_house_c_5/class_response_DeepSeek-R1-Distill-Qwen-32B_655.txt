Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, facing calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans. Schiff is defending his past comments and criticizing Trump's campaign for contacts with Russia, which he deems "not OK." He's emphasizing that some actions, like offering dirt to Trump's son, are not acceptable. 

There's a mention of Rep. Mike Conaway criticizing Schiff for promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the panel's integrity. Attorney General Barr's notification that Mueller's investigation found no collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is a key point, which Trump and his allies are using to attack Schiff and Democrats.

Schiff is continuing his investigation into Trump's links with Russia, including potential compromise by foreign powers. The hearing was marked by partisan divisions, with Republicans interrupting and comparing Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of advancing Putin's work, abusing power, and misrepresenting information. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP's actions an ambush and cheap shot.

Now, I need to create a concise summary using as many of the provided moral words as possible. I should focus on the key events, the moral framing, and include the necessary details without exceeding 200 words.

I'll start by stating Schiff's defense against calls to step down, mention his criticism of Trump's campaign contacts with Russia, and the use of the morally framed words. I'll include Conaway's criticism about the false narrative and damaged integrity. Then, I'll note Barr's report and Trump's exoneration claims. Schiff's continuation of the investigation, the hearing's flashpoints, and the comparisons to McCarthy. Finally, the Republican accusations and Democratic defense.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral language intact. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence incorporates the necessary terms without being too verbose.
