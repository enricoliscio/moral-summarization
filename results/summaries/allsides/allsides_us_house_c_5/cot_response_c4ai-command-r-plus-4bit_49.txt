SUMMARY:
The House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff faced calls to step down from his position due to his past comments and actions related to the Trump-Russia investigation. Schiff defended himself by listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deemed "not OK," suggesting potential collusion. He argued that his GOP colleagues may find it acceptable for the President's son to be offered dirt as part of a campaign, but he does not. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, accused Schiff of promoting a false narrative that has *damaged* the integrity of their committee. Other Republicans, including Rep. Michael Turner, likened Schiff to Joseph McCarthy and accused him of advancing Russian President Vladimir Putin's agenda. Schiff has stated his intention to continue the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, causing dissatisfaction among GOP members. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP's attack an *ambush* and a *cheap-shot*. The hearing, meant to focus on expert testimony about Putin, became another partisan flashpoint for the committee.
END OF SUMMARY.
