Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about a hearing where Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is under pressure from Republicans to step down. He's defending his position and the investigation into Trump's links with Russia. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used. The author uses words like "not OK," "help," "promoting," "damaged," "lying," "leaking," "forced," "investigation," "links," "compromised," "divisions," "interference," "prematurely," "revived," "expanded," "meddling," "interrupted," "dissatisfaction," "advancing," "abused," "misrepresenting," "defense," "scorned," "ambush," and "cheapshot." 

I need to make sure that my summary includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the essence of the conflict between Schiff and the Republicans, highlighting the moral stances each side is taking.

I'll start by identifying the main events: Schiff's defense of his investigation, the criticism from Republicans like Conaway and Turner, Trump's call for Schiff's resignation, and the Democrats' support for Schiff. 

I should structure the summary to show Schiff's determination to continue the investigation despite Republican accusations of promoting false narratives and abusing power. Also, include Trump's tweet about Schiff lying and leaking, and the Democrats' defense against the GOP's ambush.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is clear, using words like "not OK," "help," "promoting," "damaged," "lying," "leaking," "forced," "investigation," "links," "compromised," "divisions," "interference," "prematurely," "revived," "expanded," "meddling," "interrupted," "dissatisfaction," "advancing," "abused," "misrepresenting," "defense," "scorned," "ambush," and "cheapshot" where appropriate.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article while preserving the moral language. I'll need to be concise but comprehensive, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the necessary moral terms and the main events. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff faced calls to resign during a hearing on Russia, as Republicans criticized his investigation into Trump's links with Russia. Schiff defended his stance, labeling contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia as "not OK," and accused Republicans of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative. He rejected claims that Trump's son being offered "dirt" by Russia was acceptable, emphasizing his commitment to the investigation despite GOP accusations of "lying" and "leaking." Republicans like Rep. Mike Conaway argued Schiff had damaged the panel's integrity, while Rep. Michael Turner likened him to Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of advancing Putin's work and abusing his power. Trump tweeted for Schiff's resignation, calling him a liar. Democrats defended Schiff, with Rep. Mike Quigley denouncing the GOP's actions as a "cheap-shot" and "ambush." Schiff plans to continue the investigation, revived and expanded after the midterms, despite GOP claims of interference and premature conclusions. END OF SUMMARY.
