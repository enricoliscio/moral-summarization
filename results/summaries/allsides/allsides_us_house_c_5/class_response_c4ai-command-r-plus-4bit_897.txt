SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls for his resignation from President Trump and other Republicans, accusing them of advancing false narratives and damaging the integrity of the committee. Schiff listed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and signaling his intention to continue investigating potential collusion and compromising situations involving the President. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, alleging that he promoted demonstrably false information. The hearing was interrupted by Republican members expressing dissatisfaction with Schiff, with Rep. Michael Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive investigations. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and standing by Schiff's investigation into Russian meddling and Trump's potential compromised position. Schiff's refusal to step down and his defense of his actions highlight the partisan divisions and dramatic flashpoints within the committee.
