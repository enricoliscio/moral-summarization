SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls for his resignation from President Trump and other Republicans, accusing him of promoting a false narrative of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff listed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and that the President's son was offered dirt as part of a Russian effort to help Trump. He argued that his investigation into Trump's links to Russia and potential compromise by foreign powers would continue. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner, criticized Schiff for damaging the integrity of the committee and advancing Russian President Putin's agenda, comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and standing by Schiff's commitment to uncovering the truth about Trump's ties to Russia.
