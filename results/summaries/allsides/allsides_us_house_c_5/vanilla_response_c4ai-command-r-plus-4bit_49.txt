SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls from President Trump and Republicans for him to step down, citing his past comments about Trump's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and signaling his intention to continue the committee's investigation into Trump's links to Russia. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a false narrative and damaging the integrity of the committee. Other Republican members also voiced their dissatisfaction with Schiff during the hearing, with Rep. Michael Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead became another partisan flashpoint for the committee. 

END OF SUMMARY.
