SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans, citing his concerns over the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several instances of these contacts, which he deemed "not OK." Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the integrity of the panel. President Trump also called for Schiff's resignation, claiming he lied and leaked information. However, Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The controversy comes after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that the Mueller investigation did not find evidence of Trump campaign coordination with Russia. Despite this, Schiff plans to continue the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia and potential compromise by foreign powers.

END OF SUMMARY.
