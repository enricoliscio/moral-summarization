Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully. It's about Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, facing calls to step down from Republicans and President Trump. He's defending his position by criticizing Trump's connections with Russia. 

Schiff mentioned that contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia were "not OK," showing he'll defend his role. He criticized the idea that it's acceptable for Trump's son to be offered dirt, indicating his strong stance. 

Rep. Mike Conaway called for Schiff to resign, accusing him of promoting a false narrative that harms the committee's integrity. This tension is high, especially since Mueller's report didn't find collusion, which Trump and Republicans are using to attack Schiff. 

Schiff plans to continue the investigation, which is causing friction within the committee. Republicans, like Michael Turner, likened him to McCarthy, suggesting he's advancing Putin's interests. Democrats, like Mike Quigley, defended Schiff, calling the attacks an ambush. 

I need to capture the moral framing: Schiff as a defender of truth vs. Republicans as partisans trying to undermine him. The summary should highlight the conflict, key accusations, and the ongoing investigation. Keep it under 200 words, concise but covering all main points.
