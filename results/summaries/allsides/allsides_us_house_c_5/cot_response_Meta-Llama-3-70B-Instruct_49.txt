SUMMARY:
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively pushed back against calls for him to step down, defending his past comments about President Trump's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed "not OK" contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, signaling he'll fiercely defend himself. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, called for Schiff's resignation, claiming he promoted a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the "integrity" of the panel. President Trump also demanded Schiff's resignation, accusing him of "knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking." Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing was another dramatic flashpoint for the House Intelligence Committee, known for its partisan divisions. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, alleging the president could be potentially "compromised" by the Kremlin. END OF SUMMARY.
