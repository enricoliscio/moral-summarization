SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and Republicans, citing his past comments about the president's family and campaign's contacts with Russia as "not OK". Schiff listed several contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, which he believed were not acceptable. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, accused Schiff of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the "integrity" of the panel. Trump and his allies have seized on the revelation that Mueller's investigation did not find evidence of collusion, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, financial and otherwise, and allegations the president could be potentially "compromised" by the Kremlin or another foreign power. Republicans, including Rep. Michael Turner, interrupted the hearing, accusing Schiff of "advancing Putin's work" and "abusing" his power.

END OF SUMMARY.
