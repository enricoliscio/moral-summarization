SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively defended himself against calls from President Trump and Republicans for him to step down, citing his past comments about the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed instances of contacts between the campaign and Russia, stating that he found them morally unacceptable and that they potentially compromised the president. He argued that his investigation into Trump's links with Russia, financial or otherwise, is justified and necessary. This stance was met with criticism from some panel members, including Rep. Mike Conaway, who claimed Schiff promoted a false narrative that damaged the panel's integrity. Republicans have accused Schiff of lying and leaking information, while Democrats have defended him, calling the GOP's attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, meant to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead highlighted partisan divisions and dissatisfaction with Schiff's chairmanship. Schiff's refusal to resign and his commitment to continue the investigation signal his determination to uncover the truth and hold those involved accountable for their potentially compromising actions. 

END OF SUMMARY.
