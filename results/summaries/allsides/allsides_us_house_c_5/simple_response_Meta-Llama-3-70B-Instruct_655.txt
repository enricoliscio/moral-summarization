SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from Republicans, citing concerns over the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed several instances of contact, calling them "not OK." Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed Schiff had lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative, damaging the panel's integrity. President Trump and GOP allies seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of Trump campaign coordination with Russia, attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff vowed to continue the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, despite Trump's call for his resignation. The hearing was marked by partisan divisions, with Republicans likening Schiff to Joseph McCarthy and Democrats defending him against what they called a "cheap-shot" attack.

END OF SUMMARY.
