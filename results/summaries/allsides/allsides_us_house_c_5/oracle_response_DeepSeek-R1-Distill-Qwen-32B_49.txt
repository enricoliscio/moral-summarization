Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words, and I should use as many of them as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff, facing calls to step down from Republicans. They're accusing him of promoting a false narrative about Russia and the Trump campaign. Schiff is defending his actions, stating that contacts with Russia were "not OK." There's mention of the Mueller report, which didn't find collusion, and Trump and his allies using this to attack Schiff. Schiff is continuing his investigation, and there's a lot of tension and partisanship in the committee.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided and incorporate them into the summary. Words like "ok," "help," "promoting," "damaged," "lying," "leaking," "forced," "investigation," "links," "compromised," "divisions," "interference," "prematurely," "revived," "expanded," "meddling," "interrupted," "dissatisfaction," "advancing," "abused," "misrepresenting," "defense," "scorned," "ambush," "cheapshot."

I'll start by stating that Schiff is defending his position against calls for his resignation. He's accusing Republicans of thinking it's "ok" for Trump's son to have contacts with Russia, which he deems "not OK." He's promoting the idea that these contacts were problematic, which has damaged the committee's integrity according to Republicans. They're accusing him of lying and leaking information, which Schiff denies.

The Mueller report found no collusion, which Trump and Republicans are using to force Schiff to resign. Schiff is continuing his investigation, which he revived and expanded after taking over the committee. The hearing was interrupted by Republicans expressing dissatisfaction, with one likening Schiff to McCarthy, suggesting he's advancing Putin's work. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the Republican attack an ambush and cheap shot.

I need to make sure to include as many of the moral words as possible without making the summary too long. I'll structure it to highlight the conflict, the accusations, and the ongoing investigation, using the provided terms to frame the moral aspects.

SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is facing calls to resign from President Trump and Republicans, who accuse him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative about the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff defended his stance, stating that such contacts were "not OK," and criticized Republicans for thinking it was "OK" for Trump's son to be offered "dirt" from Russia. He emphasized that he does not view these actions as acceptable, signaling his intent to fiercely defend his leadership. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, argue that Schiff has damaged the committee's integrity by advancing a false narrative. Trump and his allies have seized on Attorney General William Barr's notification that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff for "lying" and "leaking." Schiff, however, plans to continue his investigation into Trump's links to Russia and potential compromise by foreign powers. The hearing was interrupted by Republican members expressing dissatisfaction, with Rep. Michael Turner likening Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, accusing him of advancing Putin's work and misrepresenting classified information. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the Republican attack an "ambush" and "cheap shot." END OF SUMMARY.
