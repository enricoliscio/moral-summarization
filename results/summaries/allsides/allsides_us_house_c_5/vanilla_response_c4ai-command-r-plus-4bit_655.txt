SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff pushed back against calls from President Trump and Republicans for him to step down over his comments on Trump's links to Russia. Schiff listed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, stating that he found them unacceptable and signaling his intent to continue the committee's investigation. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the panel, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a false narrative that damaged the committee's integrity. Republicans criticized Schiff for his conduct, with Rep. Michael Turner comparing him to Joseph McCarthy. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony on Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead became a partisan clash over Schiff's chairmanship.
