SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans, citing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia as "not OK." Schiff's comments came during a committee hearing on Russia, where he listed examples of Trump's campaign contacts with Russia. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, called for Schiff's resignation, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that has damaged the panel's integrity. President Trump also tweeted that Schiff should resign from Congress. Democrats, however, defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing was a dramatic flashpoint for the committee, which has been known for its partisan divisions.

END OF SUMMARY.
