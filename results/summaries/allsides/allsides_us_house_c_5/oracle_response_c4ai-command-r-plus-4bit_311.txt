SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has come under fire from Republicans, including President Trump, who have called for his resignation over his comments regarding the Trump campaign's links to Russia. Schiff aggressively defended himself, listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia that he deemed "not OK." He criticized the president's son for accepting dirt on political opponents from Russia, suggesting that such actions could compromise the president and his administration. Schiff's defense came after Rep. Mike Conaway accused him of promoting a false narrative that damaged the integrity of their panel. Other Republicans, such as Rep. Michael Turner, compared Schiff to Joseph McCarthy, claiming he was advancing Putin's agenda and abusing his power. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." Schiff has vowed to continue the investigation into Trump's links to Russia and potential compromising situations, despite Republican efforts to end the probe prematurely. The hearing highlighted the partisan divisions within the committee, with Republicans interrupting and expressing dissatisfaction with Schiff's chairmanship.
END OF SUMMARY.
