SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively pushed back against calls for his resignation from President Trump and other Republicans, defending his past comments by denouncing the president's son's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed these contacts and described them as "not OK," signaling that he will fiercely defend himself from calls to resign. He justified his stance by claiming that his colleagues might think it is acceptable for the President's son to be offered dirt as part of a campaign, but he does not. 

Schiff's comments came after Rep. Mike Conaway called for his resignation, accusing him of promoting a demonstrably false narrative that has damaged the integrity of the committee. The calls for Schiff's resignation came in the wake of Attorney General William Barr's notification to Congress that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump and his allies have seized on this revelation, claiming exoneration and attacking Schiff for his previous statements. 

Schiff, however, has stood firm, stating his intention to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia and allegations that the President could be compromised by foreign powers. The hearing was marked by partisan divisions, with Republicans interrupting to express dissatisfaction with Schiff and likening him to Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive promotion of investigations. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot."
