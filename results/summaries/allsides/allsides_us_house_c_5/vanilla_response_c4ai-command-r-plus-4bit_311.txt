SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff faced calls to resign from his post by President Trump and Republican members of the committee, including Rep. Mike Conaway and Rep. Michael Turner, who accused Schiff of promoting a false narrative about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff aggressively pushed back at these calls, defending his past comments and criticizing the president and his family for their contacts with Russia. He listed instances of the Trump campaign's interactions with Russia, stating that he believed they were not acceptable and that the president could be compromised by a foreign power. Schiff also signaled his intention to continue the committee's investigation into Trump's links to Russia. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." The hearing, which was supposed to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead became another partisan flashpoint for the committee, highlighting the ongoing divisions between Republicans and Democrats.
