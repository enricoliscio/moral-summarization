SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff faced intense criticism and calls for his resignation from President Trump and Republicans following Attorney General Barr's notification that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Rep. Mike Conaway, a senior member of the committee, stated that Schiff damaged the integrity of the panel by promoting a false narrative. Schiff defended himself by listing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, implying that he would continue the investigation into Trump's potential "compromise" by foreign powers. He accused the President's son of being offered dirt as part of a Russian effort to help Trump. Republicans, including Rep. Michael Turner, likened Schiff's actions to those of Joseph McCarthy, claiming that Schiff was advancing Putin's agenda and abusing his power. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap-shot." The hearing, intended to focus on expert testimony about Russian President Vladimir Putin, instead highlighted partisan divisions and accusations of misrepresenting information.
