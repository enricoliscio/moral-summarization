SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans, citing contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia as "not OK." Schiff's comments came after Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) called for him to resign, accusing him of promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the panel's integrity. Trump and GOP allies have seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff plans to continue the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia and allegations of potential compromise. The hearing was marked by partisan divisions, with Republicans interrupting to voice dissatisfaction with Schiff and Democrats defending him.

END OF SUMMARY.
