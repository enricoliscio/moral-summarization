Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, defending his position against calls for his resignation from Republicans. They criticize his handling of the Russia investigation. I notice words like "not OK," "help," "promoting," "damaged," etc., which are part of the moral framing.

I should start by identifying the key events: Schiff's defense, Republican criticism, the Mueller report's findings, and the partisanship within the committee. I'll need to include the morally charged terms without making the summary too long.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Schiff's stance, the Republican accusations, the Mueller report, and the ongoing investigation. I'll make sure to use words like "not OK," "help," "promoting," "damaged," "lying," "leaking," etc., as they are crucial for the moral framing.

I should also mention the partisanship and the heated exchanges, including the comparison to McCarthy. This adds depth to the moral critique. I'll keep each point concise to stay under 200 words.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Schiff's defense, moving to Republican accusations, the Mueller report, and the ongoing conflict in the committee. I'll end with the implications of the investigation and the partisanship involved.

SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended his leadership against calls for his resignation, accusing Republicans of thinking it's "not OK" that the Trump campaign had contacts with Russia. Schiff emphasized that such actions were "not OK," signaling his intent to fiercely defend his chairmanship. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, criticized Schiff for promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative, claiming it has damaged the panel's integrity. This came after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump and his allies seized on this, attacking Schiff and other Democrats for "lying" and "leaking." Schiff plans to continue the investigation into Trump's links to Russia, while Republicans, like Rep. Michael Turner, accused him of "abusing" his power and "misrepresenting" information. Democrats defended Schiff, with Rep. Mike Quigley calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and "cheap-shot." The hearing highlighted the committee's partisan divisions, with Republicans expressing dissatisfaction and even likening Schiff to Joseph McCarthy. The investigation into Russian interference and potential compromises of the president continues amid accusations of partisanship and misrepresentation. END OF SUMMARY.
