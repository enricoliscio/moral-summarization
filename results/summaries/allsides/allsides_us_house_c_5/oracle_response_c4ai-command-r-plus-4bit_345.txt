SUMMARY: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff aggressively pushed back at calls for his resignation from President Trump and other Republicans, defending his past comments by highlighting the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Schiff listed instances of the campaign's interactions with Russia, which he described as "not OK," suggesting that such actions may have helped Trump and damaged the integrity of the committee. The calls for Schiff's resignation came after Attorney General William Barr notified Congress that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff, however, plans to continue the investigation into Trump's links with Russia, believing the president could be potentially compromised by foreign powers. The hearing was marked by partisan divisions, with Republicans interrupting to express their dissatisfaction with Schiff, accusing him of advancing Putin's interests and abusing his power. Democrats defended Schiff, calling the GOP attack an "ambush" and a "cheap shot." Schiff's defense of his actions and his commitment to continuing the investigation signal his determination to uncover the truth behind the Trump campaign's links to Russia, despite intense pressure and criticism from the president and his allies.
END OF SUMMARY.
