Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, defending his position against calls from Republicans to step down. He's pushing back against claims that he should resign, especially after the Mueller report didn't find collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. 

Schiff is criticizing Trump and his family for their contacts with Russia, saying it's "not OK." He's facing criticism from Republicans like Mike Conaway and Michael Turner, who think he's promoting a false narrative and abusing his power. Turner even compared him to McCarthy, which is a strong criticism. 

On the other side, Democrats are supporting Schiff, with Mike Quigley calling the GOP's moves an ambush. The hearing was supposed to focus on Putin, but Republicans used it to attack Schiff instead. Schiff plans to continue his investigation into Trump's ties with Russia, despite the backlash.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: Schiff's defense, the criticism from Republicans, the comparison to McCarthy, Democratic support, and the ongoing investigation. Also, mention that the hearing was disrupted and the context of the Mueller report.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise. Let me structure it by mentioning Schiff's actions, the Republican criticism, the Mueller report context, and the ongoing investigation. Also, include the part where Democrats defended him and the comparison to McCarthy.

Wait, I should make sure to include that the hearing was supposed to focus on Putin but was interrupted. That shows the partisanship. Also, Trump's tweet calling for Schiff's resignation is important.

Let me try to outline the main points:

1. Schiff defends his role, criticizing Trump's Russia contacts.
2. Republicans, including Conaway and Turner, criticize him, with Turner comparing him to McCarthy.
3. Mueller report found no collusion, which Trump and Republicans use against Schiff.
4. Democrats support Schiff, calling the criticism an ambush.
5. Schiff plans to continue his investigation despite the backlash.

Now, I'll need to write this concisely, making sure each point is covered without going over the word limit.
