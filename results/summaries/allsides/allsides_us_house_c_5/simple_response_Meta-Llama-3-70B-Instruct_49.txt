SUMMARY:

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended himself against calls to step down from President Trump and other Republicans, citing the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia as "not OK." Schiff listed these contacts, including the offer of dirt to Trump's son, and emphasized that he would fiercely defend himself against accusations. Republicans, including Rep. Mike Conaway, claimed that Schiff had lost confidence in the panel by promoting a "demonstrably false" narrative that damaged the panel's integrity. Trump and his allies seized on the recent revelation that Mueller's investigation did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, claiming it exonerates Trump and attacking Schiff and other Democrats. Schiff plans to move forward with the panel's investigation into Trump's links to Russia, despite Republican attacks.

The moral framing of this article emphasizes the importance of accountability and integrity in politics. Schiff's defense of himself and his investigation highlights the need for elected officials to stand up for what they believe in, even in the face of intense criticism. The article also implies that Republicans' attacks on Schiff are motivated by a desire to protect Trump and undermine the investigation, rather than a genuine concern for the integrity of the panel.

END OF SUMMARY.
