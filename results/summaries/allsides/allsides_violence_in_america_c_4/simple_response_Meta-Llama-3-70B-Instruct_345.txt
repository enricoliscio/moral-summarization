SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, as demonstrators continued to express outrage over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest, a small group of agitators defied police orders, smashed windows, and attempted to block a highway. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with officers tackling protesters who refused to disperse. The mayor and police commissioner blamed the violence on a small group of agitators, while protesters argued that the police response was excessive and failed to address the underlying issue of institutional racism. The protests, organized by the Ferguson frontline, are part of the Black Lives Matter movement, which seeks to highlight the systemic injustices faced by black Americans. As one protester poignantly noted, "Windows can be replaced. Lives can't."
