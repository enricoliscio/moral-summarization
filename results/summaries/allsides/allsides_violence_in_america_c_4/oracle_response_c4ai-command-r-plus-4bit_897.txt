SUMMARY: More than 80 people were arrested on Sunday night as protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white policeman who had shot a black man turned violent for a third night in a row. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse after a peaceful protest. Protesters smashed windows and attempted to block a ramp to an interstate highway, leading to officers tackling and arresting them. The protests followed the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who was charged with the first-degree murder of Anthony Lamar Smith, a black man, in 2011. The violence evoked memories of the riots in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Police confiscated weapons and reported that officers were hit with an unknown chemical. Protesters also broke flowerpots and threw chunks at storefront windows. The gathering was the largest of the three nights, with more than 1,000 protesters, and police deployed their largest force yet. A photographer working for Reuters was placed in handcuffs and detained for about 30 minutes. The protests began on Friday after the acquittal, with 33 arrests made and 10 officers injured. Violence continued on Saturday and Sunday nights, with protesters smashing windows and skirmishing with police in riot gear. The protests highlight ongoing concerns about institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men.
