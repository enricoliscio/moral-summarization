SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, following the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest earlier, a small group of demonstrators defied police orders and clashed with officers in riot gear. Protesters smashed windows and attempted to block a highway, leading to the use of pepper spray and mass arrests. The mayor and police commissioner blamed a small group of "agitators" for the violence. The protests, which began on Friday, have resulted in over 120 arrests and 10 injured officers. The acquittal has sparked outrage and comparisons to the 2014 Ferguson riots, with protesters citing institutional racism and demanding justice for unarmed black men killed by police.
