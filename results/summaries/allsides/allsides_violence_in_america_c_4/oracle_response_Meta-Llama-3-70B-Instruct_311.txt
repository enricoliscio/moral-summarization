SUMMARY: 

More than 80 people were arrested on Sunday night as protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man turned violent for a third night running. The protests, sparked by the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who was charged with the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24, followed a pattern of violence, with protesters smashing windows, attempting to block a highway, and defying police orders. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators, with officers tackling some protesters who refused to disperse. The mayor blamed the trouble on "a group of agitators," while the acting police commissioner struck a hard stance, saying, "We're in control, this is our city and we're going to protect it." The violence evoked memories of the 2014 riots in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Protesters fear for their lives, with one mother saying, "Windows can be replaced. Lives can't."
