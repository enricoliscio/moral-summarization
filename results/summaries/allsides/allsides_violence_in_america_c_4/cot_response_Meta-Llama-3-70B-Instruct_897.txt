SUMMARY:
In St. Louis, protests over the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested. Despite a larger, peaceful protest, a small group of agitators sparked disorder, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with officers tackling protesters who defied orders. The mayor blamed the trouble on a group of agitators, while the acting police commissioner took a hard stance, saying "We're in control, this is our city and we're going to protect it." The protests, which have been largely non-violent, are a response to the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who was cleared of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence has evoked memories of the 2014 riots in Ferguson, with protesters arguing that the acquittal is a result of institutional racism that allows police to avoid accountability for shootings of unarmed black men.
