SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, as demonstrators continued to express outrage over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest earlier, a small group of agitators sparked violence, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway. Police responded with pepper spray and mass arrests. The mayor and police commissioner blamed the trouble on a small group of agitators, while protesters argued that the police response was excessive. The protests have drawn comparisons to the 2014 Ferguson riots, with many arguing that the acquittal is a symptom of institutional racism that allows police to avoid accountability for shooting unarmed black men. The Ferguson frontline, an informal group, has organized the protests, emphasizing that "windows can be replaced, lives can't." The violence has sparked concerns about safety and the need for justice.

END OF SUMMARY.
