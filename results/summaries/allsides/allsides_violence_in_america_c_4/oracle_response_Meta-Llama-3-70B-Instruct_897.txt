SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, as demonstrators defied orders to disperse following a peaceful protest over the acquittal of a white policeman who shot and killed a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, in 2011. The protests, which began on Friday, have been marked by violence, with protesters smashing windows, attempting to block a highway, and throwing objects at police. Police, in riot gear, used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with some officers injured. The mayor blamed a small group of "agitators" for the trouble, while the acting police commissioner vowed to "protect" the city. The protests evoke memories of the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. The demonstrations, organized by the Ferguson frontline, focus on institutional racism and police violence against unarmed black men. END OF SUMMARY.
