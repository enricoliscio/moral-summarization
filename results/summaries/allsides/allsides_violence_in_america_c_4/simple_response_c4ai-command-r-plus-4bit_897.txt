SUMMARY: Protests turned violent in St. Louis for the third night in a row after the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man. More than 80 people were arrested as police in riot gear used pepper spray and force to disperse the demonstrators. The protests, which followed the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley for the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, reflect a deep moral concern over racial injustice and the value of black lives. The violence mirrored the riots in nearby Ferguson in 2014, following the shooting of another black teenager by a white officer. Despite the presence of peaceful protesters, a small group of agitators caused disorder, smashing windows and blocking highways. Police responded with force, arresting those who defied orders to disperse. The St. Louis police commissioner, Lawrence O'Toole, vowed to protect the city, stating that "we're in control." The protests are a moral outcry against institutional racism and the unjustified use of deadly force by police against unarmed black individuals. The actions of a few agitators do not diminish the validity of the moral concerns raised by the peaceful protesters, who continue to demand justice and accountability for the loss of black lives. END OF SUMMARY.
