SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis, Missouri, over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, resulting in the arrest of over 80 people. Demonstrators defied orders to disperse, smashed windows, and blocked highways. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and made mass arrests. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, who was charged with the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots. Police confiscated weapons and reported being hit by an unknown chemical. Protesters expressed anger and fear over the acquittal, blaming institutional racism for allowing police to be cleared in shootings of unarmed black men. The protests, organized by a group called Ferguson frontline, attracted more than 1,000 people, resulting in a large police presence. A handful of demonstrators threw bottles, while police drove through crowds in unmarked cars. The protests began on Friday, with arrests and injuries reported each night.
