SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested as demonstrators clashed with police in riot gear. The protests followed the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who was found not guilty of murdering Anthony Lamar Smith, a black man, in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest earlier, a small group of protesters remained and the scene turned violent, with windows smashed and attempts to block a highway ramp. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests. The mayor and police commissioner blamed a small group of "agitators" for the trouble. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots. The protests, organized by the Ferguson frontline, focus on institutional racism and police accountability.
