SUMMARY: Peaceful protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man turned violent for a third night, resulting in the arrest of over 80 people. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, a former police officer, who was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence mirrored the riots in nearby Ferguson in 2014 after a similar incident and has brought to light the issue of institutional racism and police accountability in the shooting of unarmed black men. Protesters smashed windows and blocked highways, leading to mass arrests. Despite the majority of protesters being peaceful, the situation escalated due to a small group of agitators. The police commissioner vowed to protect the city and maintain control. The incident has sparked discussions about racial injustice and the Black Lives Matter movement, with many fearing for the safety of their loved ones. The protests highlight the ongoing struggle for justice and accountability in police shootings involving people of color.
