SUMMARY: 

Over 80 people were arrested in St. Louis on Sunday night as protests turned violent for a third consecutive night following the acquittal of a white policeman who shot and killed a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, in 2011. The protests, which began on Friday, have seen violence and clashes between demonstrators and police, with protesters smashing windows, attempting to block highways, and throwing objects at officers. Police, in riot gear, used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with some officers injured. Authorities blamed a small group of "agitators" for the trouble, while protesters argued that the violence was a result of institutional racism and a lack of accountability for police shootings of unarmed black men. The protests have drawn comparisons to the 2014 riots in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, which followed the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer.
