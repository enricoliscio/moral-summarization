SUMMARY:
Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, following the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man. The protests, which began peacefully, descended into disorder, with protesters smashing windows and attempting to block a highway. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and made mass arrests, blaming a group of "agitators" for the trouble. The mayor noted that the "vast majority of protesters are non-violent," but the acting police commissioner took a hard stance, saying "We're in control, this is our city and we're going to protect it." The protests evoke memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots, with demonstrators decrying "institutional racism" that allows police to be cleared of criminal wrongdoing in shootings of unarmed black men.
