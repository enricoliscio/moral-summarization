SUMMARY:

Over 80 people were arrested in St. Louis on Sunday night as protests turned violent for the third consecutive night following the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. The protests began peacefully but turned violent after nightfall, with demonstrators smashing windows and attempting to block a highway ramp. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with some officers tackling protesters who defied orders to disperse. The mayor and police commissioner blamed a small group of "agitators" for the violence. The protests are the latest in a series of demonstrations across the US, sparked by the Black Lives Matter movement, which began in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. The acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley has reignited tensions in the city.
