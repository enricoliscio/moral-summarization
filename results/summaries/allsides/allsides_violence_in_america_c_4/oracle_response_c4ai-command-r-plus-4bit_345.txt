SUMMARY: More than 80 people were arrested in St. Louis as protests over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man turned violent for the third night in a row. Despite the peaceful nature of the larger protest, a small group of agitators remained after nightfall and caused disorder, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, a former officer charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence mirrored the riots in nearby Ferguson in 2014 after a similar incident. Police confiscated weapons and reported being hit with an unknown chemical. Protesters threw chunks of ceramic at storefront windows and broke flowerpots. The gathering was the largest of the three nights of protests, with over 1,000 demonstrators. Police deployed a large force in response, with officers in riot gear marching through the streets. The protests began after Stockley's acquittal on Friday, with 33 arrests and 10 officers injured. Violence continued on Saturday and Sunday, with arrests and clashes each night. The protests highlight fears of institutional racism and the unjustified shooting of unarmed black men by police.
END OF SUMMARY.
