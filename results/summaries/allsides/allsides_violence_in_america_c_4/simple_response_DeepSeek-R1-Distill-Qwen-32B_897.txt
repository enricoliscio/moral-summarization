Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about protests in St. Louis after a white police officer was acquitted for shooting a black man. The protests turned violent over three nights, with many arrests. The mayor and police commissioner are addressing the situation, and there's a mention of the Black Lives Matter movement. 

I should focus on the key events: the acquittal, the violent protests, the arrests, the authorities' responses, and the underlying issues like institutional racism. I need to maintain the moral perspective, so I'll highlight the clash between peaceful protest and violent actions, the authorities' tough stance, and the community's fear and activism.

I'll structure the summary to include the main points without getting too detailed. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral elements as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white police officer, Jason Stockley, who shot a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, turned violent for three consecutive nights, with over 80 arrests on Sunday. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests after demonstrators defied dispersal orders. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the violence, while Acting Police Commissioner Lawrence Oâ€™Toole emphasized control and protection of the city. The protests, which began after Stockley's acquittal, saw peaceful gatherings turn chaotic, with windows smashed and attempts to block highways. Police confiscated weapons and decontaminated officers hit by an unknown chemical. The violence recalled the 2014 Ferguson riots, which gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters, including members of the Ferguson frontline, criticized institutional racism and police impunity in shootings of unarmed black men. The protests highlighted tensions between non-violent activism and disruptive actions, with some fearing for their safety amid ongoing clashes. END OF SUMMARY.
