Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about protests in St. Louis after a white policeman was acquitted for shooting a black man. Over 80 people were arrested when the protests turned violent. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests. The mayor blamed agitators, while the police took a hard stance. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, which reminds people of the Ferguson riots in 2014. There were clashes, property damage, and some arrests. The movement Black Lives Matter is mentioned, focusing on institutional racism.

I need to capture the key points: the protests, the violence, the arrests, the officials' responses, the connection to past events, and the underlying issues like institutional racism. Also, the moral aspect is about systemic issues and the impact on the community.

I should structure the summary to include the main events, the officials' statements, the historical context, and the broader implications. Keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me start drafting: Protests in St. Louis after a police acquittal led to violence, arrests, and comparisons to Ferguson. Highlight the officials' tough stance, the majority being peaceful, and the underlying issues of systemic racism. Mention the impact on the community and the movement's goals.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all necessary points without being too detailed. Also, maintain the moral perspective by emphasizing the systemic issues and community fears.
