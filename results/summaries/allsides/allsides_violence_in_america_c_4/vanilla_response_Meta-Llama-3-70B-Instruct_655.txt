SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, resulting in over 80 arrests, as demonstrators continued to express outrage over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest earlier, a smaller group of protesters remained and clashed with police, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway ramp. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with some officers reporting being hit with an unknown chemical. The protests, which have drawn comparisons to the 2014 Ferguson riots, were sparked by the acquittal of former officer Jason Stockley, who was charged with murdering Anthony Lamar Smith. The demonstrations have been organized by an informal group known as the Ferguson frontline, which focuses on institutional racism and police accountability.
