SUMMARY:
Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, following the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man. Despite a larger, peaceful protest, a small group of agitators defied police orders, leading to disorder and violence. Police used pepper spray and tackled protesters, with some attempting to block a highway ramp and smashing windows. The mayor blamed the trouble on a group of agitators, while the police commissioner took a hard stance, saying "we're in control, this is our city and we're going to protect it." The protests, sparked by the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, have raised concerns about institutional racism and police wrongdoing in the shooting of unarmed black men.
