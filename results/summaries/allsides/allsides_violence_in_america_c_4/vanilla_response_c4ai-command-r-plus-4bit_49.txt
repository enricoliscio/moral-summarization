SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis, Missouri, over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, resulting in the arrest of over 80 people. Demonstrators defied orders to disperse, smashed windows, and attempted to block a highway. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested protesters, with the acting police commissioner taking a hard stance against the violence. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The incident evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Police confiscated weapons and reported being hit by plastic spray bottles containing an unknown chemical. The protests, organized by an informal group called Ferguson frontline, focused on institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men. One protester, Missy Gunn, expressed fear for her college-age son. The article also mentions the Ferguson protests giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.
