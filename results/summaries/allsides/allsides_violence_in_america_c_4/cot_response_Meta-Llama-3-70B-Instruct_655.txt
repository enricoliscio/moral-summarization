SUMMARY:
Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, following the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man. The protests began peacefully, but a small group of agitators sparked trouble, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with officers tackling protesters who defied orders. The mayor blamed the trouble on "a group of agitators," while the acting police commissioner struck a hard stance, saying "We're in control, this is our city and we're going to protect it." The protests are a response to the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who was cleared of murder charges in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence has evoked memories of the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri, with protesters citing institutional racism and demanding justice for unarmed black men who have been victims of police wrongdoing.
