SUMMARY: 

Over 80 people were arrested in St. Louis as protests turned violent for a third night, following the acquittal of a white policeman who shot and killed a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, in 2011. The protests, which began peacefully, descended into violence as a small group of demonstrators defied police orders, smashed windows, and attempted to block a highway ramp. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and tackled protesters, making mass arrests. The mayor blamed the trouble on "a group of agitators," while the acting police commissioner vowed to "protect" the city. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Protesters fear that the acquittal will lead to more shootings of unarmed black men, perpetuating institutional racism. The protests, organized by the Ferguson frontline, aim to highlight the need for accountability and justice in police shootings.
