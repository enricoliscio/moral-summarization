SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, resulting in the arrest of over 80 people. The violence followed a larger, peaceful protest during the day, but after nightfall, a small group remained and clashed with police. Officers used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with police blaming agitators for the disorder. The protests were sparked by the acquittal of Jason Stockley, who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. During the protests, police confiscated weapons and reported being hit by an unknown chemical. The protests in St. Louis have been the largest of the three nights, with over 1,000 protesters and a heavy police presence. The protests have been organized by an informal group known as Ferguson frontline, focusing on institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men.
