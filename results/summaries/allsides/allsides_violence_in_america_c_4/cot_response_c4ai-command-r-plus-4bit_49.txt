SUMMARY: Riots in St. Louis following the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, with more than 80 people arrested. Despite initial peaceful protests, a small group turned to disorder, smashing windows and blocking highways. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and mass arrests to control the agitators. The protests followed the acquittal of officer Jason Stockley, who shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots following the shooting of a black teenager. Police confiscated weapons and defended themselves against unknown chemicals. Protesters expressed their anger and fear, breaking flowerpots and throwing chunks at storefront windows. The protests, organized by Ferguson frontline, highlighted institutional racism and police wrongdoing in shootings of unarmed black men. The officer claimed Smith was shot after a drug deal, but prosecutors argued the weapon was planted. END OF SUMMARY.
