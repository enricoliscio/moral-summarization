SUMMARY: Over 80 people were arrested in St. Louis on Sunday night as protests against the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man turned violent for the third night in a row. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, 36, who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse. Protesters smashed windows, attempted to block a highway, and threw chunks of ceramic at storefront windows. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Police confiscated weapons and reported being hit by an unknown chemical. Sunday's gathering was the largest of the three nights, with more than 1,000 protesters. The protests began on Friday after the acquittal, with 33 arrests and 10 officers injured. Violence flared again on Saturday and Sunday nights, with more arrests and clashes between protesters and police. The protests have been organized by an informal group focused on institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men.
END OF SUMMARY.
