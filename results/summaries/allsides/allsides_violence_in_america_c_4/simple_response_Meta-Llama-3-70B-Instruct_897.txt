SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for the third night in a row, with over 80 people arrested, following the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest earlier, a small group of demonstrators defied police orders and turned violent, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with some protesters carrying weapons and throwing objects at officers. The mayor and police commissioner blamed a small group of "agitators" for the violence, while protesters argued that the police response was excessive. The protests are a response to the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who was found not guilty of murdering Anthony Lamar Smith, a 24-year-old black man. The incident has sparked outrage and fears of institutional racism, with many protesters arguing that the justice system is failing black communities.
