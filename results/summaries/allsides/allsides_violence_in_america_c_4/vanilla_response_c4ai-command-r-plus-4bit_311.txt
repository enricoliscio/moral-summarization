SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, with more than 80 people arrested. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse. The protests followed the acquittal of former officer Jason Stockley, who was charged with the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence evoked memories of the riots in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Protesters smashed windows and attempted to block a highway, leading to mass arrests. The protests were organized by an informal group known as Ferguson frontline, focusing on institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men. Police reported confiscating weapons and unknown chemicals that hit officers. The protests began on Friday with 33 arrests and continued through the weekend with more arrests and clashes. The violence in St. Louis follows a pattern of protests across the U.S. by the Black Lives Matter movement.
