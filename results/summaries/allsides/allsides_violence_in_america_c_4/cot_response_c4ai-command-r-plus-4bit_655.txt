SUMMARY: 
In the wake of the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man, St. Louis experienced its third night of violent protests. More than 80 demonstrators were arrested by riot police after windows were smashed and attempts were made to block a highway. Despite the majority of protesters being peaceful, a small group caused disorder and police responded with pepper spray and mass arrests. The protests follow the acquittal of Jason Stockley, who was charged with the murder of Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. The incident has brought to light issues of institutional racism and police wrongdoing, with protesters fearing for the lives of innocent black men. Police confiscated weapons from protesters and reported injuries and unknown chemicals used against officers. The violence echoes the 2014 Ferguson riots and has been organized by the Ferguson frontline group, who protest institutional racism and police being cleared of wrongdoing in shootings of unarmed black men. The protesters argue that windows can be replaced, but lives cannot, highlighting the moral imperative to address racism and police violence.
