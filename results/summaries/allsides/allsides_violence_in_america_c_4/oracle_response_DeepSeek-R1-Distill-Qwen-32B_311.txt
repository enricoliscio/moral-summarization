Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points and the author's tone.

The article is about protests in St. Louis following the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man. The protests turned violent over three nights, with many arrests. The author uses words like "acquittal," "shot," "arrested," "defied," "orders," etc., which have strong moral connotations.

I should focus on including as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of the events while highlighting the moral aspects.

I'll start by identifying the main events: the acquittal leading to protests, the violence, arrests, the police's response, and the underlying issues like institutional racism. I'll make sure to mention the comparison to the Ferguson riots and the Black Lives Matter movement to show the context.

I'll structure the summary to first state the acquittal and the resulting protests, then describe the violent actions, police response, and the statements from officials and protesters. I'll end by tying it back to broader issues of racism and the impact on the community.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring I include the key morally charged words and keep it within the word limit. I'll check that the summary flows logically and maintains the moral framing from the original article.

SUMMARY: Over 80 people were arrested in St. Louis as protests over the acquittal of a white police officer, Jason Stockley, who shot a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, turned violent for a third night. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and made mass arrests after demonstrators defied orders to disperse. The protests, which began peacefully, escalated into chaos, with windows smashed, an interstate highway blocked, and clashes between protesters and police. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed the violence on "agitators," while Acting Police Commissioner Lawrence Oâ€™Toole vowed to "protect" the city. The acquittal of Stockley, who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting, reignited tensions reminiscent of the 2014 Ferguson riots. Protesters, some armed with bats or hammers, clashed with police, leading to injuries and arrests. The protests, organized by the Ferguson frontline, highlight concerns over institutional racism and police accountability. The violence overshadowed the peaceful protests, as demonstrators expressed fears for their safety and the impact of systemic injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
