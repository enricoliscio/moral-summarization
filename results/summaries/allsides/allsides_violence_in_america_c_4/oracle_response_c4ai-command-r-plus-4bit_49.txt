SUMMARY: More than 80 people were arrested in St. Louis on Sunday night as protests over the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man turned violent for the third night in a row. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse after a peaceful protest. Protesters smashed windows and attempted to block a highway, and officers used pepper spray and tackled protesters before making mass arrests. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, a former police officer, of first-degree murder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, a 24-year-old black man, in 2011. The violence evoked memories of the riots in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Police confiscated weapons and reported being hit by an unknown chemical. Protesters threw chunks of ceramic at storefront windows and broke flowerpots. The protests began on Friday after the acquittal, with 33 arrests and 10 officers injured. Violence flared again on Saturday and Sunday, with more arrests and clashes between protesters and police. The protests were organized by an informal group called Ferguson frontline, focusing on institutional racism that has allowed police to be cleared in several shootings of unarmed black men.
END OF SUMMARY.
