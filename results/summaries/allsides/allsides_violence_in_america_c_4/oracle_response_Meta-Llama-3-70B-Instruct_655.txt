SUMMARY: 
In St. Louis, protests over the acquittal of a white policeman who shot and killed a black man turned violent for a third night, resulting in over 80 arrests. The protests, sparked by the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, followed a pattern of violence, with protesters smashing windows, attempting to block a highway, and defying police orders. Police in riot gear responded with pepper spray and mass arrests. The mayor blamed a small group of "agitators" for the trouble, while the acting police commissioner vowed to "protect" the city. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots, also sparked by a white police officer's shooting of a black teenager. Protesters, including members of the Ferguson frontline, decried institutional racism and police impunity in shootings of unarmed black men. The protests began peacefully, but turned violent as the night wore on, with police reporting confiscation of weapons and injuries. END OF SUMMARY.
