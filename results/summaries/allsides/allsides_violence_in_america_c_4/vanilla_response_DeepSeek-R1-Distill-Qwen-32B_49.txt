Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article about protests in St. Louis. They provided the full article and an example of a summary. My job is to create a new summary based on the article, making sure it's under 200 words and follows the specified format.

First, I need to read the article thoroughly to understand the key points. The protests are happening because a white policeman was acquitted in the shooting death of a black man. This has led to three nights of protests, with the third night being the largest. On Sunday, over 80 people were arrested, and the situation turned violent. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests after the peaceful protest turned disorderly.

I should note the main events: the acquittal of Jason Stockley, the violent protests, the number of arrests, the police response, and the comparison to past riots in Ferguson. Also, the mention of the Black Lives Matter movement and the underlying issues of institutional racism are important context.

I need to condense all this information into a concise summary. I should start by stating the acquittal and the resulting protests, then mention the arrests and police actions. Including the comparison to Ferguson and the broader movement adds context. I'll need to ensure that each sentence is clear and sticks to the main points without getting bogged down in details.

I should also watch the word count to stay under 200 words. I'll structure the summary to flow logically: starting with the event, the protests, the violence, police response, and then the context of previous events and the movement.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence adds value and doesn't repeat information unnecessarily. I'll check for clarity and conciseness, ensuring that all key elements are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Protests in St. Louis escalated on Sunday night after the acquittal of former police officer Jason Stockley, who was charged with the 2011 killing of Anthony Lamar Smith, a black man. Over 80 people were arrested as demonstrations turned violent for the third consecutive night. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and made mass arrests after protesters defied orders to disperse. The unrest included window-smashing and attempts to block highways, with police confiscating weapons and chemical-filled bottles. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the violence, while police emphasized control of the situation. The protests, which began Friday, followed the acquittal and mirrored the 2014 Ferguson riots after the killing of Michael Brown. The Ferguson Frontline group organized the protests, citing institutional racism. Sundayâ€™s gathering was the largest, with over 1,000 protesters. Police deployed their strongest force, and some journalists were briefly detained. The violence highlighted ongoing tensions over police accountability and racial justice in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
