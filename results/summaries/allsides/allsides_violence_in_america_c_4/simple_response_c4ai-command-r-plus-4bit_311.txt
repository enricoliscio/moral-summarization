SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, resulting in the arrest of over 80 people. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, a former police officer, of first-degree murder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. The violence evoked memories of the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. The St. Louis protests began on Friday after the acquittal, with 33 arrests made and 10 officers injured. Violence flared again on Saturday and Sunday nights, with protesters smashing windows and police using pepper spray and mass arrests. The protests have been organized by an informal group called Ferguson frontline, focusing on institutional racism that has allowed police to be cleared of wrongdoing in shootings of unarmed black men. The violence and destruction of property are troubling, but the protesters' anger and frustration are understandable given the systemic racism that persists in the US criminal justice system. It is crucial that these issues are addressed and that steps are taken to ensure equal justice and protection for all citizens, regardless of race or ethnicity.
