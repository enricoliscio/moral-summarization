Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. It's about protests in St. Louis after a police officer was acquitted for shooting a black man. The protests turned violent over three nights, with many arrests and clashes between police and demonstrators.

The author uses words like "acquittal," "shot," "arrested," "defied," "smashed," "riots," "violence," "racism," and "feared." I need to include these terms in the summary. 

I should start by mentioning the acquittal and the resulting protests. Then, describe the violence, arrests, and the police response. It's important to highlight the moral issues like institutional racism and the fear expressed by the community. I'll also note the comparison to the Ferguson riots and the Black Lives Matter movement.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the key moral points without adding my own opinions. I'll structure it to flow from the event to the reactions and the broader context. Let me make sure to include all the required moral terms naturally in the summary.

SUMMARY:  
Protests in St. Louis erupted after the acquittal of a white police officer, Jason Stockley, who was charged with the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, a black man. Over three nights, tensions escalated as peaceful protests turned violent, with more than 80 people arrested. Police, in riot gear, used pepper spray and made mass arrests after demonstrators defied orders to disperse. Violence included smashed windows, blocked highways, and clashes with officers. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the trouble, while police emphasized their control and commitment to protect the city. The protests evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots, which gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Demonstrators, some fearing for their lives, accused institutions of racism, as police confiscated weapons and faced projectiles thrown by protesters. The violence overshadowed the initial peaceful gatherings, highlighting ongoing tensions over police accountability and racial justice. END OF SUMMARY.
