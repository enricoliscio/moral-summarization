Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the protests in St. Louis. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article talks about protests turning violent after a white policeman was acquitted for shooting a black man. The summary should highlight the key events, the reactions from the authorities, and the underlying issues like institutional racism.

First, I should note the number of arrests and the violent actions, like window-smashing and blocking highways. It's important to mention the police response with pepper spray and mass arrests. Also, the mayor's statement about non-violent protesters and blaming agitators adds a moral angle, showing a divide in the protest groups.

The article also connects this to past events in Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing systemic issues. I should include that context to show the broader implications. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the protests, violence, police response, the mayor's comments, and the historical context.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing, which includes the frustration of the community and the police's firm stance. Including quotes like "Windows can be replaced. Lives can’t" adds that emotional and moral perspective. I'll structure the summary to flow from the events to the reactions and then to the broader context.

SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third consecutive night after the acquittal of a white police officer accused of killing a black man. Over 80 people were arrested as police used pepper spray and riot gear to disperse demonstrators. While most protesters remained non-violent, a small group engaged in vandalism, including smashing windows and blocking highways. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed the violence on "agitators," while police Commissioner Lawrence O’Toole emphasized control and protection of the city. The protests followed the acquittal of former officer Jason Stockley, who shot Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. The violence echoed past unrest in Ferguson, where the 2014 killing of Michael Brown sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters, including members of the Ferguson frontline, criticized systemic racism and police impunity. Police confiscated weapons and chemicals used against them, and journalists were briefly detained. The protests highlighted ongoing tensions over racial justice and police accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
