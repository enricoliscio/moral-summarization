SUMMARY: More than 80 people were arrested in St. Louis on Sunday night as protests over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for the third night in a row. The protests began after former officer Jason Stockley was acquitted of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. Demonstrators smashed windows and attempted to block a highway ramp, leading to clashes with police in riot gear. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests. The violence evoked memories of the 2014 Ferguson riots following the shooting of another black man by a white officer. Police confiscated weapons and reported being hit by plastic spray bottles containing an unknown chemical. Protesters expressed anger and fear over the acquittal, with one mother stating, "Windows can be replaced. Lives can't." The protests were organized by an informal group known as Ferguson frontline, which focuses on institutional racism in policing.
