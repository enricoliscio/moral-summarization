Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. I need to make sure I capture the key points and the underlying moral perspective the author presented. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. It's about protests in St. Louis after a white policeman was acquitted for shooting a black man. The protests turned violent over three nights, with arrests and clashes between police and demonstrators. The article mentions the acquittal of Jason Stockley and the comparison to the 2014 Ferguson riots, which ties into the Black Lives Matter movement. 

I should note the moral framing here. The author seems to highlight the frustration and systemic issues, as seen through the protesters' actions and the response from authorities. The mention of "agitators" by the mayor and the police's hard stance suggests a divide between non-violent protesters and those causing chaos. 

I need to summarize this in under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event: the acquittal leading to protests. Then, mention the violence, arrests, and the comparison to Ferguson. It's important to include the systemic racism angle and the protesters' perspective, as well as the police's response. I should also touch on the confiscated weapons and the photographers' incident to show the tensions. 

I'll make sure to keep the summary concise but comprehensive, highlighting both the actions of the protesters and the authorities, as well as the underlying moral issues related to racial justice and police accountability. 

Let me structure this step by step: start with the acquittal, then the protests and violence, mention the arrests and police response, include the systemic racism angle, and conclude with the broader implications of the protests. That should cover all the key points while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis erupted after the acquittal of a white police officer who fatally shot a black man in 2011. Over three nights, tensions escalated, with more than 80 arrests made as violent clashes occurred. Police used pepper spray and riot gear to disperse demonstrators, while some protesters smashed windows and blocked highways. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the violence, though many remained peaceful. The protests mirrored the 2014 Ferguson riots, highlighting systemic racism and police accountability. Protesters, including members of the Ferguson frontline, criticized the justice system, emphasizing that "lives canâ€™t be replaced" like broken windows. Police confiscated weapons and decontaminated officers after being hit with unknown chemicals. The protests reflect ongoing tensions over racial injustice and police violence. END OF SUMMARY.
