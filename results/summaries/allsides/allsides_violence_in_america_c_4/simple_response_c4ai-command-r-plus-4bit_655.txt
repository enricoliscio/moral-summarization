SUMMARY: More than 80 people were arrested in St. Louis on Sunday night as protests over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for the third night in a row. The protests began after Jason Stockley, a former police officer, was acquitted of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. Despite the presence of peaceful protesters, a small group of agitators caused disorder by smashing windows, blocking highways, and throwing objects at police officers. The police responded with pepper spray and mass arrests, with officers tackling and decontaminating protesters. This violence echoed the riots in nearby Ferguson in 2014, following the shooting of another black teenager by a white officer. Protesters expressed their outrage at the institutional racism that allows police officers to be cleared of wrongdoing in shootings of unarmed black men. The police commissioner, Lawrence O'Toole, vowed to protect the city and maintain control. The protests were organized by an informal group, Ferguson Frontline, who fear for the lives of their black sons and demand justice.
