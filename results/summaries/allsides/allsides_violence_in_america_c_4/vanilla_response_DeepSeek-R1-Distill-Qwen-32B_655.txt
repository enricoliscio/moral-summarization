Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the protests in St. Louis. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that over 80 people were arrested on Sunday night due to violent protests in St. Louis. The protests are about the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man. The protests turned violent for the third night in a row. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests after the demonstrators didn't disperse after a peaceful protest.

It mentions that the scene turned disorderly after nightfall, similar to the previous two nights. Protesters smashed windows and tried to block a highway. The police confiscated weapons and dealt with chemical sprays. The mayor noted that most protesters were non-violent, blaming a few agitators. The police took a hard stance, saying they're in control.

The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley, a former police officer, in the 2011 shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith. This reminded people of the 2014 Ferguson riots. The article also talks about the police's large deployment and some incidents involving journalists and photographers.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main events: the number of arrests, the reason for protests, the violent actions, police response, the mayor and police statements, the context of the acquittal, and the comparison to Ferguson riots. I should also mention the confiscated weapons and the impact on the community.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the arrest and the reason. Then describe the violent actions and police response. Mention the mayor's comments and the police's stance. Include the context of the trial and the comparison to Ferguson. Finally, note the confiscated weapons and the community's reaction.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going into too much detail. Also, keep the language clear and straightforward.
