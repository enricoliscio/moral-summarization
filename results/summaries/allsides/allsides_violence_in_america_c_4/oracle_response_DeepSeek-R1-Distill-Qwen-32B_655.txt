Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about protests in St. Louis after a white policeman was acquitted for shooting a black man. The protests turned violent over three nights, with many arrests. The author uses words like "acquittal," "shot," "arrested," and "violence," which have moral connotations.

I should focus on the main events: the acquittal leading to protests, the violent actions, the police response, and the context of past riots. I need to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll start by mentioning the acquittal and the resulting protests. Then, I'll note the violence, smashed windows, and blockades. Include the police's use of pepper spray and mass arrests. The mayor's statement about non-violent protesters and the blame on agitators is important. Also, the comparison to Ferguson riots and the Black Lives Matter movement adds context.

I should also mention the confiscated weapons and the clash between protesters and police. The fear expressed by the mother and the broader issue of institutional racism are key points. Finally, I'll touch on the initial drug deal and the acquitted officer's actions.

Now, I'll structure this into a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the moral terms.

SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis erupted after the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man in 2011, turning violent for three nights. Over 80 people were arrested as demonstrators defied orders to disperse, smashing windows and attempting to block highways. Police, in riot gear, used pepper spray and made mass arrests. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the trouble, while police emphasized their control and duty to protect the city. The violence echoed past riots in Ferguson, linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters clashed with officers, and weapons were confiscated. The protests began peacefully but escalated, with some throwing objects and breaking storefronts. The acquittal followed a trial where the officer was accused of planting a weapon, but the judge ruled the gun belonged to the victim. The protests highlight ongoing tensions over institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men. END OF SUMMARY.
