SUMMARY:
Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, as demonstrators defied orders to disperse following a larger, peaceful protest. The protests were sparked by the acquittal of a white policeman, Jason Stockley, who shot and killed a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, in 2011. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed the trouble on "a group of agitators," while Acting Police Commissioner Lawrence O'Toole struck a hard stance, saying, "We're in control, this is our city and we're going to protect it." The violence evoked memories of the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Protesters, including members of the Ferguson frontline, are demanding an end to institutional racism and police wrongdoing, with one protester saying, "Windows can be replaced. Lives can't."
