SUMMARY: More than 80 protesters were arrested in St. Louis on Sunday night as demonstrations against the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man turned violent for the third night in a row. The protests, which followed a larger peaceful gathering, saw demonstrators smashing windows and blocking highways. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and tackled protesters who defied orders to disperse. The violence mirrored the riots in nearby Ferguson in 2014 after a similar incident. The protests began after the acquittal of former officer Jason Stockley, who shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. Police confiscated weapons and reported injuries from unknown chemicals. The mayor blamed a small group of agitators for the trouble, while police vowed to protect the city. The St. Louis protests are the latest in a series of demonstrations against institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men. The movement, known as Black Lives Matter, has staged protests across the U.S. following several controversial acquittals.
