Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about protests in St. Louis after a white police officer, Jason Stockley, was acquitted for shooting Anthony Lamar Smith, a black man. The protests turned violent over three nights, leading to arrests and clashes with police. The author uses words like "acquittal," "shot," "arrested," "defied," "orders," "smashed," "block," "trouble," "protect," "death," "violence," "riots," "shooting," "hit," "protest," "broke," "threw," "arrests," "injured," "shattered," "skirmished," "clashes," "killing," "racism," "shootings," "feared," and "deal."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the main events and the moral implications. I'll start by mentioning the acquittal and the resulting protests. Then, I'll note the violent actions, arrests, and the police response. Including the mayor's and police commissioner's statements adds context about the blame on agitators and the protection of the city. I should also mention the historical context with the Ferguson protests and the Black Lives Matter movement to highlight the ongoing issues with racism and police shootings.

I'll structure the summary to flow from the initial event (acquittal) to the protests, the violence, police actions, and the underlying issues. I'll make sure to use the specified moral words without adding any new ones. Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together, making sure each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis erupted after the acquittal of white police officer Jason Stockley, who was charged with the 2011 shooting death of black man Anthony Lamar Smith. Over three nights, violent clashes occurred, with more than 80 people arrested as demonstrators defied orders to disperse. Protesters smashed windows, blocked highways, and clashed with police in riot gear, who used pepper spray and made mass arrests. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the trouble, while Acting Police Commissioner Lawrence O’Toole vowed to "protect" the city. The violence echoed the 2014 Ferguson riots following the killing of Michael Brown. Police confiscated weapons and chemicals used against officers, as protests turned chaotic. While the majority remained non-violent, the clashes highlighted ongoing tensions over institutional racism and police shootings of unarmed black men. The protests, organized by the Ferguson frontline, focused on systemic issues, with one organizer stating, "Windows can be replaced. Lives can’t." The acquittal reignited fears and anger, as the community grappled with the legacy of racial injustice. END OF SUMMARY.
