Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. They specified that the summary should be after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about protests in St. Louis after a police officer was acquitted for shooting a black man. Over 80 people were arrested, and there was violence for three nights. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests. The mayor mentioned that most protesters were peaceful but blamed agitators. The protests followed the acquittal of Jason Stockley in 2017, which reminds people of the Ferguson riots in 2014. The article also mentions the Black Lives Matter movement and the context of the shooting, where the officer was accused of planting a weapon.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by stating the number of arrests and the reason for the protests. Then mention the police response, the mayor's comments, the comparison to Ferguson, and the underlying issues like institutional racism. I'll keep it under 200 words, making sure each sentence is clear and to the point. I'll avoid unnecessary details and focus on the key events and implications.

Let me structure it: start with the arrests, the cause of the protests, the police action, the mayor's statement, the comparison to Ferguson, the involvement of Black Lives Matter, and the broader context of the shooting and the movement's goals. That should cover all the essential points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Over 80 people were arrested in St. Louis as protests over the acquittal of a white police officer, Jason Stockley, who shot a black man in 2011, turned violent for a third night. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests after demonstrators defied orders to disperse. The mayor acknowledged the majority of protesters were non-violent but blamed "agitators" for the chaos. The protests, which began after Stockley's acquittal on Friday, saw peaceful gatherings followed by violent clashes, including window-smashing and attempts to block highways. Police confiscated weapons and decontaminated officers after being hit with an unknown chemical. The violence echoed the 2014 Ferguson riots following the killing of Michael Brown. The protests, organized by the Ferguson frontline, focus on institutional racism and police accountability. The movement highlights the broader issue of unarmed black men being shot by police, with some fearing for their lives despite the destruction of property. END OF SUMMARY.
