SUMMARY: 
In St. Louis, more than 80 people were arrested as protests against the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man turned violent for the third night in a row. Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse after a larger, peaceful protest. The violence mirrored the riots in nearby Ferguson in 2014, following the wrongful shooting of a black teenager by a white officer. Protesters smashed windows, blocked highways, and skirmished with police, resulting in mass arrests. The St. Louis protests began after the acquittal of officer Jason Stockley, who shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. Police confiscated weapons and faced chemical sprays, blaming agitators for the violent disorder. The protests were organized by an informal group focusing on institutional racism and wrongful police shootings of innocent, unarmed black men. One protester, Missy Gunn, expressed her fear for her son's safety. The article also mentions a judge's controversial belief that a gun planted by Stockley belonged to Smith, raising questions about wrongful accusations and police misconduct.
