Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about protests in St. Louis after a white policeman was acquitted for shooting a black man. There were three nights of protests, with the third night being the largest. The protests turned violent, leading to over 80 arrests. The police used pepper spray and riot gear. The mayor blamed a small group of agitators, while the police commissioner took a hard stance, emphasizing control and protection of the city.

I need to capture the key events: the acquittal leading to protests, the escalation into violence, the police response, and the context of previous protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. Also, the moral framing is important. The article highlights the divide between peaceful protesters and violent agitators, and the systemic issues of racism and police violence.

I should make sure the summary includes the number of arrests, the police actions, the mayor's and commissioner's statements, the reference to past riots in Ferguson, and the underlying issues of institutional racism. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me structure it: start with the acquittal and the protests, mention the violence and arrests, the officials' responses, the comparison to Ferguson, and the broader context of systemic issues. Make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the contrast between non-violent and violent protesters, and the systemic racism the movement addresses.

I should avoid getting bogged down in too many details, focusing on the main moral points and the key events. Also, ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting the events and their implications.

Now, putting it all together, making sure to include all necessary elements without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200.

SUMMARY: Protests in St. Louis over the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man turned violent for a third night, leading to over 80 arrests. Police used pepper spray and riot gear as demonstrators defied orders to disperse. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the violence, while Acting Police Commissioner Lawrence Oâ€™Toole emphasized control and protection of the city. The protests, the largest on Sunday with over 1,000 participants, followed the acquittal of former officer Jason Stockley in the 2011 killing of Anthony Lamar Smith. Violence included window-smashing and highway blockades, reminiscent of the 2014 Ferguson riots. Police confiscated weapons and chemicals used against officers. The protests highlight systemic racism and police violence, with organizers focusing on institutional issues. The moral framing underscores the contrast between peaceful protesters and violent acts, reflecting broader concerns over racial justice. END OF SUMMARY.
