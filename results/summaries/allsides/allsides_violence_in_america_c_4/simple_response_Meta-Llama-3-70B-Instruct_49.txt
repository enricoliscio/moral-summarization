SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for the third night in a row, with over 80 people arrested, as demonstrators continued to express outrage over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest earlier, a small group of agitators sparked violence, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway. Police used pepper spray and arrested demonstrators who defied orders to disperse. The mayor and police commissioner blamed the trouble on a small group of agitators, while protesters argued that the police response was excessive. The protests, which began on Friday, have been fueled by concerns over institutional racism and police brutality, echoing the 2014 Ferguson riots. The acquittal of the police officer has sparked widespread outrage and fear among the black community, with many seeing it as a miscarriage of justice.
