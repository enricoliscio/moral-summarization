SUMMARY:

Protests in St. Louis turned violent for a third night, with over 80 people arrested, as demonstrators continued to express outrage over the acquittal of a white police officer who shot and killed a black man in 2011. Despite a larger, peaceful protest earlier, a smaller group of protesters remained and clashed with police, smashing windows and attempting to block a highway ramp. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests, with some protesters tackled to the ground. Authorities reported confiscating weapons and recovering plastic spray bottles containing an unknown chemical. The protests, which began on Friday, have resulted in over 120 arrests and at least 10 officers injured. The demonstrations have drawn parallels to the 2014 Ferguson riots, with protesters citing institutional racism and police brutality.
