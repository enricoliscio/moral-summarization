Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about protests in St. Louis after a white policeman, Jason Stockley, was acquitted for shooting a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, in 2011. The protests turned violent over three nights, leading to mass arrests. The police used pepper spray and made arrests when people defied orders to disperse. The mayor blamed agitators, while the police took a hard stance. There were clashes, window-smashing, and blocking highways. The protests were compared to the 2014 Ferguson riots, which led to the Black Lives Matter movement. The article mentions the acquittal, violence, arrests, defying orders, smashing windows, blocking, trouble, protecting, death, and other moral terms.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should structure it to include the key events: the acquittal, the violent protests, police response, arrests, the mayor's statement, comparison to Ferguson, and the underlying issues like racism and fear for safety.

I should start by stating the acquittal and the resulting protests. Then mention the violence, police actions, arrests, and the mayor's and police statements. Include the comparison to Ferguson and the broader movement against police violence. Finally, touch on the fear expressed by the mother and the underlying issues like drug deals and planted weapons.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and includes all the main points without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure it's concise.

SUMMARY:  
Protests in St. Louis erupted after the acquittal of white police officer Jason Stockley, who was accused of murdering black man Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. Over three nights, tensions escalated as violent clashes occurred, with more than 80 arrests made after demonstrators defied orders to disperse. Police used pepper spray and made mass arrests as protesters smashed windows, blocked highways, and clashed with officers. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the trouble, while police Commissioner Lawrence Oâ€™Toole vowed to "protect" the city. The violence echoed the 2014 Ferguson riots, which gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters, some armed with bats or hammers, shattered windows and skirmished with police, leading to injuries and arrests. The protests highlighted fears of institutional racism and police violence, with one mother expressing dread for her college-age son's safety. The acquittal reignited debates over justice and systemic inequality in policing. END OF SUMMARY.
