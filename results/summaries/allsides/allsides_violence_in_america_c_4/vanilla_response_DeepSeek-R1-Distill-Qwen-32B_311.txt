Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant. They provided a detailed news article about protests in St. Louis after a police officer's acquittal. My job is to summarize this article concisely, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the protests over the acquittal of Jason Stockley, the violence that ensued, the number of arrests, the police response, and the historical context with Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement.

I need to identify the essential information: more than 80 arrests, the violent protests on three consecutive nights, the police using riot gear and pepper spray, the mayor's statement, the confiscation of weapons, and the comparison to past events in Ferguson. Also, the context of the trial and the acquittal of Stockley in the 2011 shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith is important.

I should structure the summary to include the main events, the number of arrests, the police's response, the mayor's comments, and the historical significance. I need to keep it clear and concise, making sure not to include unnecessary details.

I should also be cautious about the word count, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the protests, the violence, the arrests, the police actions, the mayor's statement, and then tie it to the Ferguson protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. I'll also include the fact that the protests started after the acquittal and the context of the trial.

I should avoid getting too deep into the trial details unless it's crucial. The main focus should be on the protests, their scale, the police response, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to mention the confiscated weapons and the comparison to the 2014 Ferguson riots to highlight the significance.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by noting the ongoing tensions and the impact on the community. This should give a comprehensive yet concise summary of the article.

The protests, organized by the Ferguson frontline, highlight concerns about institutional racism and police accountability. The acquittal of Stockley, who faced charges for the death of Anthony Lamar Smith, sparked widespread anger, with clashes involving rocks, bottles, and broken windows. The situation reflects ongoing tensions over racial justice in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
