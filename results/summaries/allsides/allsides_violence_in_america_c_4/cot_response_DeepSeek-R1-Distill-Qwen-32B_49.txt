Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about protests in St. Louis and outlined specific steps to follow. 

First, I need to understand the task. They want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to write a summary preserving those moral words. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the morally framed terms.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each paragraph to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "arrested," "protests," "violent," "acquittal," "riot gear," "pepper spray," "disperse," "disorder," "smashed," "block," "aggravators," "hard stance," "control," "protect," "acquitted," "murder," "shooting," "evoked," "riots," "confiscating," "weapons," "chemical," "decontaminated," "peaceful," "force," "riot gear," "hands in the air," "safe," "ordered," "wall," "assignment," "Facebook," "handcuffs," "released," "injuries," "arrested," "violence," "flared," "bats," "hammers," "shattered," "skirmished," "protests," "acquittal," "peaceful," "clashes," "Ferguson," "killing," "indicted," "Black Lives Matter," "protests," "institutional racism," "cleared," "criminal wrongdoing," "unarmed," "planted," "weapon," "car," "drug deal," "believed," "gun."

Now, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these morally charged words. I should focus on the key events: the protests, arrests, police response, the acquittal, the comparison to Ferguson, the use of force, and the underlying issues like institutional racism and the Black Lives Matter movement.

I'll start by mentioning the acquittal leading to protests, the violent actions, police response, the mayor's and police commissioner's statements, the confiscation of weapons, the peaceful majority vs. agitators, and the historical context of Ferguson. I'll also touch on the concerns about safety and justice, tying it back to the broader movement.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include as many moral terms as possible without making it too verbose. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the event, the reactions, the context, and the implications.

**SUMMARY:**  
Protests in St. Louis escalated after the acquittal of a white police officer who shot a black man, leading to violent clashes for three consecutive nights. Over 80 people were arrested as police used pepper spray and riot gear to disperse demonstrators. While most protesters were peaceful, a small group caused disorder, smashing windows and blocking highways. Mayor Lyda Krewson blamed "agitators" for the violence, while police Commissioner Lawrence Oâ€™Toole emphasized control and protection of the city. The protests mirrored the 2014 Ferguson riots, reigniting tensions over institutional racism and police accountability. Police confiscated weapons and chemicals used against them, and journalists were briefly detained. The violence highlighted fears for black lives and the struggle for justice, echoing the Black Lives Matter movement. The acquittal of the officer, charged with planting a weapon, sparked widespread outrage and demands for accountability.
