SUMMARY: Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell indicating that he is open to hearing witnesses but has not made a final decision. McConnell suggested following the precedent set in President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a fair trial must include witnesses and relevant documents, or it will be perceived as a sham. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and it is unlikely he will be convicted by the Republican-controlled Senate. The process has been delayed as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, aiming to pressure Republicans to agree to trial rules that include witnesses. Schumer has requested subpoenas for key witnesses, but the White House previously blocked their testimony during House proceedings. The debate continues over how to conduct a fair trial, with Democrats pushing for transparency and Republicans seeking a swift conclusion to the impeachment hunt.
END OF SUMMARY.
