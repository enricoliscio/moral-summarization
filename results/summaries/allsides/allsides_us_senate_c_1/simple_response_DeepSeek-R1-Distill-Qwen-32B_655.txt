Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about the U.S. Senate's discussions regarding the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Republican leader Mitch McConnell is mentioned as saying they haven't ruled out hearing witnesses, but he's using the 1999 Clinton trial as a model. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that witnesses and documents are essential for a fair trial. Trump's impeachment by the House is over pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and Trump is unlikely to be removed by the Republican Senate. Pelosi hasn't sent the articles yet, possibly to pressure the Senate into agreeing on trial rules.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. The original text has a neutral tone but includes quotes that have moral implications, like Schumer calling it a "sham trial" and Trump calling it a "witch hunt." I need to capture these moral elements without adding my own bias.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: McConnell's stance, the comparison to the Clinton trial, Schumer's arguments, the charges against Trump, the likelihood of conviction, Pelosi's strategy, and Trump's tweets. I'll make sure to include the moral language from the quotes to reflect the framing.

I'll start by stating the Senate's debate, mention McConnell's position and the Clinton trial reference. Then, I'll note Schumer's emphasis on witnesses and documents, followed by the charges against Trump. I'll mention the low chance of conviction, Pelosi's delay, McConnell's response, and Trump's accusations. I'll end with the political stakes and the requested witnesses blocked by the White House.

I need to keep it concise, around 200 words, so I'll make sure each sentence is clear and to the point without unnecessary details. I'll avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts and quotes provided.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting they follow the 1999 Bill Clinton trial model, which included limited witness testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that witnesses and documents are essential for a fair trial, warning that without them, the process could appear " sham." Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a potential Democratic candidate. With a Republican-controlled Senate unlikely to convict Trump, the trial's fairness is under scrutiny. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed sending the impeachment articles to the Senate, possibly to negotiate trial rules. Trump accused Democrats of a "witch hunt" and demanded a swift resolution. Schumer has requested subpoenaing four witnesses, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton, but the White House has blocked their testimony. The trial's moral stakes highlight the tension between political strategy and the pursuit of justice. END OF SUMMARY.
