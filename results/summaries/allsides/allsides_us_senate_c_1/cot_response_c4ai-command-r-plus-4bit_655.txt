SUMMARY: 
Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating that the possibility of hearing witnesses has not been ruled out. McConnell suggested following the precedent set by the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that refusing to call witnesses and release relevant documents would make the trial appear as a "sham trial, a show trial" to the American people. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, stemming from his dealings with Ukraine. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the impeachment a "Witch Hunt" and a "Scam." The trial is expected to begin in early 2020, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of the articles of impeachment to pressure Senate Republicans into agreeing to Schumer's demands for trial rules. McConnell insists the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles. Schumer has requested subpoenas for key witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, both of whom were blocked by the White House from testifying in the House proceedings. The outcome of the trial is uncertain, but Trump is unlikely to be convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate.
