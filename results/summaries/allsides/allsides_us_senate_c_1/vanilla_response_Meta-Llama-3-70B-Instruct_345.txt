SUMMARY:

US Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting he may allow witnesses to testify, but only after opening arguments and a written question period. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are demanding witnesses and documents be included in the trial, arguing that without them, the trial would be seen as a "sham". The impeachment trial is expected to begin in early 2020, but has been delayed as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Trump has accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the process. The Senate cannot take action until it receives the articles, and McConnell has cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model.

END OF SUMMARY.
