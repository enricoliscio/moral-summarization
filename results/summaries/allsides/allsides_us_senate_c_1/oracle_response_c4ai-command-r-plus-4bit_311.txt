SUMMARY: Senators are currently debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he is open to hearing witnesses, but has not committed to a Democratic request to agree on taking testimony ahead of time. McConnell has instead suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. The inclusion of witnesses is likely to prolong the trial and could bring forth new damaging evidence against Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. The trial is expected to begin in early 2020, and there is little chance that Trump will be convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is currently withholding the articles of impeachment to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an agreement on trial rules with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who has requested the subpoena of four witnesses. The debate over witness testimony and document release is shaping the moral framework of the trial, with Democrats arguing that a refusal to allow witnesses and documents would make the trial seem like a "sham" and a "show."
END OF SUMMARY.
