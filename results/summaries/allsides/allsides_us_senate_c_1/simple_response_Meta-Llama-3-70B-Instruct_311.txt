SUMMARY:

The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is expected to begin in early 2020, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell hinting that he may allow witnesses to testify, as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided which witnesses to call after opening arguments and a written question period. However, Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are pushing for the release of relevant Trump administration documents and witness testimony, arguing that without them, the trial would seem like a "sham trial" to the American people. Trump, meanwhile, has accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Democrats are fighting for transparency and accountability, while Republicans are trying to rush through a trial without considering all the evidence. The American people deserve a fair and thorough trial, not a "witch hunt" or a "show trial".
