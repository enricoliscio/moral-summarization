SUMMARY: Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell indicating that witness testimony may be considered. McConnell suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. McConnell's comments come in response to Democratic requests for the Senate to agree ahead of time to hear witnesses. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, argued that a trial without documents and witnesses would be perceived as a "sham trial" by the American people. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, stemming from his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, has delayed transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, hoping to pressure Republicans to agree to fair trial rules. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, who were blocked from testifying in the House proceedings. Trump has called for a quick end to the impeachment process, which he deems a "Witch Hunt."
END OF SUMMARY.
