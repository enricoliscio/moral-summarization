Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of President Trump. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that Senate Republicans, led by McConnell, haven't ruled out witnesses but are using the Clinton trial as a model. I should note that McConnell is open to witnesses but not committing to it upfront.

Then, Democrats like Schumer are insisting on witnesses and documents, arguing it's essential for a fair trial. I need to highlight their stance and why they think it's necessary.

The article also talks about the House's impeachment vote and the charges against Trump, so I should include that briefly. Trump's response, dismissing the charges and criticizing Democrats, is important too.

Lastly, the process is stalled because Pelosi hasn't sent the articles to the Senate yet, which is a tactic to pressure Republicans. I'll make sure to mention that and the blocked witnesses.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll structure it to cover McConnell's position, Democratic demands, the charges, Trump's reaction, and the current procedural impasse. That should cover the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell indicating openness to hearing witnesses, though not committing to it beforehand. McConnell referenced the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton as a model, suggesting a similar process with opening arguments and potential witnesses. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without documents and witnesses would appear sham-like. Trump was impeached by the House for abuse of power and obstructing Congress, with charges stemming from his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Trump denies wrongdoing and criticizes Democrats for stalling. The trial is unlikely to result in conviction due to Republican control of the Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed sending impeachment articles to the Senate, seeking procedural concessions. Schumer wants to subpoena four witnesses, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton, but the White House has blocked their testimony. Trump accuses Democrats of a "witch hunt" and calls for a swift resolution. END OF SUMMARY.
