SUMMARY: U.S. senators engaged in a moral debate over the impending impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell hinted at the possibility of hearing witnesses, but stopped short of committing to Democratic demands. McConnell drew a parallel to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, suggesting a similar approach that included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. The inclusion of witnesses, especially current and former administration officials, could prolong the trial and potentially uncover further damaging evidence against Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argued that a refusal to call witnesses and release relevant documents would render the trial a shameful sham. The House impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Despite Trump's claims of doing nothing wrong, the Witch Hunt label, and his urging for a swift end to the impeachment process, the Senate trial is expected to commence in early 2020. The timing is contingent on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a tactic to pressure Senate Republicans into agreeing on trial rules with Schumer. McConnell emphasized the Senate's inability to act until it receives the articles, while Trump denounced Pelosi's delay as an attempt to hide a weak case. Schumer has requested subpoenas for key witnesses, but the White House previously blocked their testimony during House proceedings.
END OF SUMMARY.
