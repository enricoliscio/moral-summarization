SUMMARY:

US Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting he may consider hearing from witnesses, as demanded by Democrats. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insists that witnesses and documents are necessary for a fair trial, warning that without them, the trial would seem like a "sham." Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives last week, has urged a quick conclusion to the process, accusing Democrats of delaying tactics. The Senate cannot take action until it receives the articles of impeachment from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is holding back to pressure Senate Republicans to agree on trial rules.
