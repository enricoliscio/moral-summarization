SUMMARY:
US Senators are at odds over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided what witnesses to call after opening arguments and a written question period. Democrats, however, are pushing for a "fair" trial that includes witnesses and documents, arguing that without them, the trial would seem like a "sham" to the American people. Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, has denied doing anything "wrong" and accused Democrats of delaying tactics. He urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, calling it a "Witch Hunt" and a "Scam". The trial is expected to begin in early 2020. END OF SUMMARY.
