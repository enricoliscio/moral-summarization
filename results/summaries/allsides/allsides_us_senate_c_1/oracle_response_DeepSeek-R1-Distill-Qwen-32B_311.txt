Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The words to keep are: fair, trial, pressuring, abuse, obstructing, hold, hunt, impeachment.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. Senate discussing the impeachment trial of President Trump. Republicans led by McConnell are considering whether to allow witnesses, similar to Clinton's trial. Democrats like Schumer want witnesses and documents, arguing it's necessary for a fair trial. Trump was impeached by the House for pressuring Ukraine and obstructing Congress. The Senate trial is expected to begin in 2020, but Pelosi hasn't sent the articles yet, possibly to negotiate trial rules. Trump accused Democrats of a witch hunt on Twitter.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the Senate's debate, McConnell's stance, Schumer's demands, the charges against Trump, Pelosi's delay, and Trump's accusations. I'll make sure to include the moral words: fair, trial, pressuring, abuse, obstructing, hold, hunt, impeachment.

I should structure it to highlight the conflict between Republicans and Democrats, the procedural aspects, and the implications. I'll ensure each moral word is used appropriately in context.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure it's concise and includes all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Trump's impeachment trial, with Republicans led by Mitch McConnell considering allowing witnesses, as Democrats demand. McConnell referenced the 1999 Clinton trial, emphasizing fairness and procedural similarity. Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without witnesses or documents would appear sham-like, essential for a fair process. Trump was impeached by the House for pressuring Ukraine and obstructing Congress, with little chance of conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate. Pelosi has delayed sending the impeachment articles to pressure Republicans into agreeing on trial rules. Trump accused Democrats of a witch hunt on Twitter, urging a swift end to the impeachment process. Schumer requested subpoenaing four witnesses, all blocked by the White House, including Bolton and Mulvaney. The trial's fairness and procedural integrity remain central to the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
