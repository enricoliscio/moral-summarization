Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Republicans and Democrats are sparring over the process. McConnell, the Republican leader, is considering allowing witnesses but hasn't committed yet. He's using the Clinton impeachment as a model, which had limited testimony. Democrats, led by Schumer, argue that witnesses and documents are essential for a fair trial, otherwise, it would seem like a sham. Trump was impeached by the House for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, which could affect the 2020 election. The Senate trial is expected to begin in early 2020, but Trump is unlikely to be convicted. Pelosi hasn't sent the articles to the Senate yet, possibly to negotiate trial rules. Trump accuses Democrats of delaying tactics and calls it a witch hunt. Schumer wants specific witnesses, but the White House has blocked them.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing. The author seems critical of both sides, but perhaps leans towards the Democratic perspective, emphasizing the need for a fair trial with witnesses. I should highlight the conflict between Republicans wanting a limited trial and Democrats pushing for a thorough one. Also, mention the political implications and the partisanship involved.

I should structure it by stating the main issue, the positions of both parties, the reasons behind their stances, and the implications. Make sure to include key details like the Clinton trial reference, the witnesses blocked, Pelosi's strategy, and Trump's accusations.

Let me start drafting:

"U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Trump's impeachment trial, with Republicans led by McConnell considering allowing witnesses but not committing, while Democrats, led by Schumer, argue for a fair trial with documents and testimony. McConnell referenced the Clinton trial, which had limited testimony, but Democrats warn without witnesses, the trial would seem sham-like. Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine, targeting Biden, a potential 2020 candidate. Pelosi hasn't sent articles to the Senate, possibly to negotiate rules. Trump accuses Democrats of delay and witch hunt. Schumer seeks witnesses blocked by the White House, highlighting the partisan divide and the high stakes of the trial."

Wait, that's a bit over. Let me trim it down.

"U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Trump's impeachment trial. Republicans, led by McConnell, have not ruled out witnesses but are following the Clinton trial model, which had limited testimony. Democrats, led by Schumer, argue that a trial without documents and witnesses would seem like a sham. Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, a potential 2020 candidate. Pelosi hasn't sent the articles to the Senate, possibly to negotiate trial rules. Trump accuses Democrats of delaying tactics and calls it a witch hunt. Schumer seeks witnesses blocked by the White House, highlighting the partisan divide and the high stakes of the trial."

That's 155 words. Maybe add a bit more detail about the charges and the political implications.

Still around 150 words. Maybe include that the trial is unlikely to convict Trump, emphasizing the political nature.

Trump accuses Democrats of delay and witch hunt. Schumer seeks witnesses blocked by the White House, highlighting the partisan divide and the high stakes of the trial, which is unlikely to convict Trump given the Republican majority."

That's 170 words. I think that captures the main points and the moral framing from the article.
