SUMMARY:

US Senators are at odds over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell hinting that he may allow witnesses, as Democrats have demanded, but only if the trial follows the "fair" model of President Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, insist that the trial must include witnesses and documents, warning that without them, the trial would be a "sham" and appear unfair to the American people. The House voted to impeach Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation, but Trump claims he did nothing wrong and has accused Democrats of delaying tactics. Trump has urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, calling it a "Witch Hunt" and an "Impeachment Scam". The Senate cannot take action until it receives the articles of impeachment from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is holding out to pressure Senate Republicans to agree on trial rules.
