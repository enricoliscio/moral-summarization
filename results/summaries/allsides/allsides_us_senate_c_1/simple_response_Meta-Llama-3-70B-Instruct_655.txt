SUMMARY:

The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is expected to begin in early 2020, but senators are at odds over the inclusion of witnesses. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has not ruled out hearing from witnesses, citing the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model. However, Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are demanding that witnesses be allowed to testify, arguing that a trial without witnesses would be a "sham trial" and appear unfair to the American people. The White House has blocked four key witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, from testifying. Trump has accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process. The moral framing of this issue is clear: allowing witnesses to testify is essential for a fair and transparent trial, while blocking them would undermine the integrity of the process and potentially conceal wrongdoing.

END OF SUMMARY.
