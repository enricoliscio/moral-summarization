Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of President Trump. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article mentions that U.S. senators are debating the structure of the impeachment trial. Republican leader Mitch McConnell hasn't ruled out hearing witnesses, but he's not committing to it yet. He referenced the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial as a model, which involved opening arguments, written questions, and limited video testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are pushing for witnesses and documents, arguing that without them, the trial would seem like a sham. 

The article also explains that the House impeached Trump on charges related to pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, which is a political rival. Trump's defense is that he did nothing wrong, and there's little chance he'll be convicted by the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump is criticizing Democrats for delays and wants a quick trial. Pelosi hasn't sent the impeachment articles to the Senate yet, possibly to pressure Republicans into agreeing on trial rules. McConnell says the Senate can't act until they receive the articles. Schumer wants four witnesses, but the White House blocked them from testifying in the House.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the debate over witnesses, McConnell's stance, Schumer's demands, the nature of the impeachment charges, the political implications, and the procedural delays.

Let me structure this: Start with the debate in the Senate, mention McConnell's position and the Clinton trial reference. Then, note Schumer's insistence on witnesses and documents. Explain the impeachment charges and Trump's situation. Mention Pelosi's delay and Trump's criticism. Finally, note the blocked witnesses and the political context.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all essential elements without getting too detailed. Also, keep the language clear and concise.
