SUMMARY: Senators are currently debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell refusing to rule out the possibility of hearing witnesses, but not committing to it either. McConnell suggested following the precedent set by the impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. The inclusion of witnesses, particularly those blocked by the White House during the House impeachment proceedings, could reveal new damaging evidence against Trump. 

Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, emphasized the importance of including witnesses and documents in the trial, arguing that without them, the American people would view it as a sham. The House impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, stemming from his dealings with Ukraine and the Bidens. Despite the efforts of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to pressure Senate Republicans by withholding the articles of impeachment, Trump is pushing for a swift end to the process, claiming it is a "Witch Hunt." Schumer has requested subpoenas for key witnesses, but their testimony could be blocked again by the White House. 

McConnell maintains that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles of impeachment, while Trump continues to denounce the process as a "scam." The trial is expected to begin in early 2020, and there is little expectation that Trump will be convicted and removed from office. 

END OF SUMMARY.
