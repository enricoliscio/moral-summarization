SUMMARY:
U.S. senators are at odds over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, saying "fair is fair." However, Democrats argue that a trial without witnesses and documents would be a "sham trial" and a "show trial." Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, has accused Democrats of "delaying tactics" and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, calling it a "Witch Hunt" and an "Impeachment Scam." The White House blocked four witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, from testifying during impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.
