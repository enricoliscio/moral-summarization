SUMMARY: Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell indicating that witness testimony may be considered, but stopping short of committing to Democrats' demands. McConnell suggested following the precedent set in the impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, argued that refusing to call witnesses and release relevant documents would make the trial seem like a sham. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation into his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The debate over the trial format reflects the partisan divide, with Democrats pushing for a thorough trial with witnesses and Republicans seeking to avoid prolonging the process. The ball is currently in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's court, as she has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Trump has accused Pelosi of delaying tactics and called for a swift end to the impeachment "witch hunt." 

END OF SUMMARY.
