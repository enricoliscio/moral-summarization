Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of President Trump. The key points are that Republican leader McConnell hasn't ruled out witnesses but is following the Clinton trial model, which limited testimony. Democrats like Schumer want witnesses and documents, arguing it's essential for a fair trial. Trump is impeached on charges of pressuring Ukraine, and the Senate trial is expected to begin in early 2020. The moral framing here is about fairness and the integrity of the trial process. McConnell is portrayed as trying to maintain a balanced approach, while Democrats see the process as potentially biased without witnesses. Trump's side is depicted as dismissive, calling it a witch hunt. I need to capture these perspectives concisely in the summary, highlighting the conflict over witnesses and the political implications. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll focus on the main arguments and the moral implications each side presents.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republicans led by Mitch McConnell suggesting they may allow witnesses, though not yet committing to it. McConnell referenced the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, which included limited testimony, as a model. Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without documents and witnesses would appear sham-like, emphasizing the need for transparency. Trump, impeached by the Democratic-controlled House, faces charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress over his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Schumer has requested four witnesses, but the White House has blocked their testimony. Trump accuses Democrats of a "witch hunt" and calls for a swift trial, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delays sending the articles to the Senate to negotiate trial rules. The trial, expected to begin in early 2020, is unlikely to result in Trump's conviction by the Republican-controlled Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
