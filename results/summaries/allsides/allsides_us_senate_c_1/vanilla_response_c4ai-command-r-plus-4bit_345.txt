SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating that hearing witnesses has not been ruled out, but stopping short of committing to Democrats' demands. McConnell suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, argued that a trial without documents and witnesses would be perceived as a sham trial by the American people. The House impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation into his dealings with Ukraine. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to convict him. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of impeachment articles to pressure Senate Republicans to agree on trial rules with Schumer. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four witnesses, but the White House blocked their testimony during House proceedings. McConnell stated that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles from the House.
END OF SUMMARY.
