SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating that hearing witnesses is still under consideration. McConnell suggests following the precedent set by the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. Allowing witnesses could prolong the trial and potentially reveal new damaging evidence against Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. 

Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, emphasizes the importance of witnesses and documents for a fair trial, arguing that excluding them would make the process seem like a sham to the American people. The House impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, stemming from his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a potential political rival. 

Trump has called for a swift end to the impeachment process, accusing Democrats of stalling. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, aiming to pressure Republicans to agree on trial rules with Schumer. McConnell acknowledges that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles. 

The trial's outcome remains uncertain, but there is little expectation that Trump will be convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate. The debate over witnesses and documents highlights the moral and ethical dimensions of the impeachment process, with both parties arguing for a fair and just resolution.
END OF SUMMARY.
