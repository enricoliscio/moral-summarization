SUMMARY:
U.S. senators are at odds over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided what witnesses to call after opening arguments and a written question period. Democrats, however, are pushing for a "fair" trial that includes witnesses and documents, arguing that without them, it would be a "sham trial, a show trial." Trump, meanwhile, accused Democrats of "delaying tactics" and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, calling it a "Witch Hunt" and a "scam." The trial is expected to begin in early 2020, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, in a bid to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an accord with Democrats on trial rules.
