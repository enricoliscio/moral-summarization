SUMMARY:

US Senators are at odds over the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting he may consider hearing from witnesses, as demanded by Democrats. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. However, allowing witness testimony could prolong the trial and bring up new evidence damaging to Trump. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insisted that the trial must include witnesses and urged the release of relevant Trump administration documents, warning that a trial without them would seem like a "sham trial, a show trial". Trump, who was impeached by the House on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, has denied wrongdoing and accused Democrats of delaying tactics. The impeachment process has been stalled as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, pressuring Senate Republicans to reach an accord with Schumer on trial rules.

END OF SUMMARY.
