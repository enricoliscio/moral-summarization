SUMMARY: Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating that hearing witnesses is still a possibility. McConnell suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a fair trial must include witnesses and relevant documents, or it will be perceived as a sham. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. With the Republican majority in the Senate, Trump's conviction and removal from office are unlikely. Meanwhile, Trump has criticized the Democrats' delay tactics and called for a swift end to the impeachment process. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment to pressure Senate Republicans to agree on trial rules with Schumer. McConnell maintains that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles. The debate revolves around the inclusion of witnesses and documents to ensure a fair trial and avoid a "witch hunt."
END OF SUMMARY.
