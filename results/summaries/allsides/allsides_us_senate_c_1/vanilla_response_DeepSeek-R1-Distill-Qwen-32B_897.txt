Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of President Trump. The user provided the article, and they want a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, ending with specific tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main topics are the Senate's debate over the trial's structure, McConnell's stance on witnesses, the comparison to Clinton's trial, Schumer's demands, and Trump's reactions.

I should identify the main actors: McConnell, Schumer, Trump, and Pelosi. The key points are McConnell not ruling out witnesses but wanting to follow the Clinton trial model, which had limited testimony. Schumer insists on witnesses and documents, fearing a sham trial without them. Trump was impeached by the House on two charges related to Ukraine and Biden, and there's little chance of conviction in the Senate. Trump accuses Democrats of delaying, and Pelosi hasn't sent the articles yet to pressure Republicans.

I need to condense this into a summary that includes these elements: the debate over witnesses, McConnell's approach, Schumer's demands, Trump's charges, Pelosi's strategy, and Trump's criticism. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essentials without too much detail.

Now, I'll structure the summary: start with the Senate debate, McConnell's position, Schumer's stance, mention the charges against Trump, Pelosi's move, and Trump's criticism. I'll make sure to include the comparison to the Clinton trial and the potential impact of witnesses on the trial's length and outcome.

I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, each sentence building on the previous one, and that it's clear and concise. I need to avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, ending with the specified tokens.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's within the word limit and accurately reflects the article's content without any unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting they follow the 1999 Bill Clinton trial model, which included limited witness testimony. McConnell has not ruled out witnesses but has not committed to Democrats' demands for testimony during the trial. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insists the trial must include witnesses and documents, warning that without them, it would appear sham-like. Trump, impeached by the House over pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, faces charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress. Senate Republicans are unlikely to convict him. Trump accused Democrats of delaying tactics, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, seeking trial rule concessions. McConnell said no action can occur until the Senate receives the articles. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four witnesses, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton, blocked by the White House. END OF SUMMARY.
