SUMMARY:

US Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insisted that the trial must include witnesses and urged the release of relevant Trump administration documents, warning that a trial without witnesses would seem like a "sham trial" to the public. Trump, meanwhile, accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process. The House has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, and McConnell said the Senate cannot take action until it receives them.
