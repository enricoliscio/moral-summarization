SUMMARY: 

US Senators are at odds over the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell hinting that he may allow witnesses, as demanded by Democrats. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. However, allowing witness testimony could prolong the trial and bring up new evidence damaging to Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. 

Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urged for a "fair" trial with witnesses and documents, warning that without them, the trial would seem like a "sham" to the American people. Trump, meanwhile, accused Democrats of "delaying tactics" and pressed for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, calling it a "Witch Hunt" that must end now. The Senate cannot take action until it receives the articles of impeachment from the House.

END OF SUMMARY.
