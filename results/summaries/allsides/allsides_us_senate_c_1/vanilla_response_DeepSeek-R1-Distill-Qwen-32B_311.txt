Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of President Trump. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that U.S. senators are debating the structure of the impeachment trial. Republican leader Mitch McConnell says they haven't ruled out hearing witnesses, but he's not committing to it yet. He's using the 1999 Clinton trial as a model, which involved opening arguments, written questions, and limited video testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are pushing for witnesses and documents, arguing that without them, the trial would seem like a sham.

The article also mentions that Trump was impeached by the House on charges related to pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, who is a potential Democratic candidate. Trump hasn't been convicted yet, and there's little chance he will be, given the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump is accusing Democrats of delaying tactics and wants a quick resolution. House Speaker Pelosi hasn't sent the articles of impeachment to the Senate yet, possibly to negotiate trial rules. McConnell says the Senate can't act until they receive the articles.

Schumer wants four witnesses, but the White House blocked them from testifying in the House proceedings. Trump is also tweeting about this, calling it a witch hunt and a scam.

So, the key points are:
- Senate debates over impeachment trial structure.
- McConnell open to witnesses but not yet committed.
- Democrats demand witnesses and documents, else trial seems fake.
- Trump's impeachment charges related to Ukraine and Biden.
- Little chance of conviction, Senate needs articles to proceed.
- Pelosi's delay tactic, Trump's accusations, and blocked witnesses.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main actors, their positions, the charges, and the current state of the trial process.

Let me structure it: Start with the Senate debate, McConnell's stance, Democrats' demands, the charges against Trump, the likelihood of conviction, Pelosi's actions, and Trump's reactions. Keep it concise, making sure each point is clear but brief.

I should also mention the potential impact of witnesses and documents, as that's a significant point of contention. And note that the trial hasn't started yet because Pelosi hasn't sent the articles.

I think that covers all the essential elements without going into too much detail. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting they could hear witnesses, though not committing to it. McConnell referenced the 1999 Bill Clinton trial, which involved limited testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that without witnesses and documents, the trial would appear sham-like. Trump faces charges tied to pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a potential Democratic candidate. With a Republican-controlled Senate, conviction is unlikely. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hasn't sent the impeachment articles to the Senate, possibly to negotiate trial rules. Trump accuses Democrats of delaying tactics and calls the process a witch hunt. Schumer seeks to subpoena four witnesses blocked by the White House, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton. The trial hasn't begun as the Senate awaits the articles. END OF SUMMARY.
