SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying that hearing witnesses has not been ruled out. McConnell suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. Allowing witnesses could prolong the trial and potentially reveal new evidence damaging to Trump. Democrat Chuck Schumer argued that a trial without documents and witnesses would be perceived as a sham by the American people. The House impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, but the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to convict and remove him from office. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of impeachment articles to pressure Senate Republicans to agree on trial rules with Schumer. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. Trump has called for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, accusing Democrats of delaying tactics.
END OF SUMMARY.
