SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell indicating that witness testimony may be considered. McConnell suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have demanded witness testimony and the release of relevant documents, arguing that a trial without them would be perceived as a sham. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation into his dealings with Ukraine. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of impeachment articles to the Senate to pressure Republicans to agree to trial rules. McConnell stated that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles. Trump has called for a quick trial, accusing Democrats of delaying tactics. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four key witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton.
END OF SUMMARY.
