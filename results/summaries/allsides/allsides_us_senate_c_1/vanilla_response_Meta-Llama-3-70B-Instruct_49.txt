SUMMARY:

US Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are pushing for witnesses, including current and former administration officials, and the release of relevant documents. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, is unlikely to convict Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, seeking to pressure Senate Republicans to agree on trial rules. Trump has accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process.

END OF SUMMARY.
