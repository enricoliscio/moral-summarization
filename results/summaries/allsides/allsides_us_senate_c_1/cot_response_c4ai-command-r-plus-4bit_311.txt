SUMMARY: Senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has not ruled out hearing witnesses, but has not agreed to Democrats' demands for the Senate to commit to taking testimony ahead of time. McConnell cites the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which ended in acquittal, as a model for the current process. Democrats argue that a trial without documents or witnesses would seem like a sham trial to the American people. The House impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and accused Democrats of a Witch Hunt. The trial in the Republican-controlled Senate is expected to begin in early 2020, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of impeachment articles to pressure Republicans to agree to trial rules. Schumer has requested subpoenas for key witnesses blocked by the White House during the House investigation. The outcome of the trial will determine if Trump is guilty and should be removed from office, or if he will default and remain in power.
END OF SUMMARY.
