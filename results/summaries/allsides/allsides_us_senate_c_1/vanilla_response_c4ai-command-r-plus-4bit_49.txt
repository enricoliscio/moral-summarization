SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating that hearing witnesses is still under consideration. McConnell suggested following the precedent set in President Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, which included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. Allowing witnesses could prolong the trial and potentially uncover new evidence damaging to Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without witnesses and documents would be perceived as a sham by the American people. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of impeachment articles to pressure Senate Republicans to negotiate trial rules with Schumer. Trump has accused Pelosi of stalling and demanded a swift conclusion to the impeachment process. McConnell maintains that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four key witnesses, but the White House previously blocked their testimony during House impeachment proceedings.
END OF SUMMARY.
