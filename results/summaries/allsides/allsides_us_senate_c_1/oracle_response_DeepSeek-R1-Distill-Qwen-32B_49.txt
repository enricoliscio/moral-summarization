Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the query again. They provided a Reuters article about the U.S. Senate's impeachment trial discussions. The author used specific morally charged words like "fair," "trial," "pressuring," "abuse," "obstructing," "hold," "hunt," and "impeachment." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read the article to understand the key points. The main issue is the Senate's debate over whether to allow witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial. McConnell, the Republican leader, is referencing the Clinton trial as a model, which was similar but had limited witnesses. Democrats, led by Schumer, argue that without witnesses and documents, the trial would seem like a sham. Trump was impeached by the House for pressuring Ukraine and obstructing Congress. The trial is unlikely to remove him, but Democrats want a fair process. Pelosi hasn't sent the articles yet, possibly to negotiate trial rules. Trump is calling it a witch hunt on Twitter.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the Senate's debate, McConnell's stance, the Clinton trial reference, and the moral implications. Then, I'll include Schumer's arguments about fairness and the necessity of witnesses. I should highlight Trump's charges and his defense. Also, note Pelosi's delay and Trump's accusations. Make sure to use the specified moral words.

Let me structure it: Start with the Senate debate, McConnell's position, the Clinton trial as a model, the moral framing of fairness. Then, Schumer's points about the trial needing witnesses and documents, the perception of it being a sham. Mention Trump's charges, his denial, and the low chance of conviction. Pelosi's delay and Trump's witch hunt accusation. End with the trial's fairness and integrity.

I need to keep it concise, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft. Okay, that should cover all necessary points while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting they follow the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, emphasizing "fairness." Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without witnesses and documents would appear like a "sham" or "show trial." Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House for "pressuring" Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and "abusing" power, charges he denies. Schumer has requested four witnesses, but the White House has blocked their testimony. McConnell has not ruled out witnesses but wants to proceed cautiously, while Trump accuses Democrats of a "witch hunt" and urges a swift conclusion. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, possibly to negotiate trial rules. The trial's fairness and integrity remain central to the debate, with Trump unlikely to be removed by the Republican-controlled Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
