Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using as many of those words as possible. 

Starting with the article, I'll read through it to find the morally charged terms. Words like "impeachment," "abuse of power," "witnesses," "fair," " sham," "witch hunt," "scam," "delaying tactics," and "pressure" stand out. These words carry moral connotations, indicating blame, fairness, deceit, etc.

Next, I need to craft a summary that's under 200 words. I should include the key points: the Senate's debate over the impeachment trial, McConnell's stance, Schumer's demands, the potential witnesses, Trump's accusations, Pelosi's strategy, and the overall political dynamics. I'll make sure to incorporate the identified moral terms to maintain the original framing.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Republicans and Democrats, the procedural issues, and the implications of the trial. Using the morally framed words will help convey the tension and accusations present in the article.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary is clear and concise, covering all essential aspects without exceeding the word limit. I'll check that all the key points are included and that the moral framing is preserved as per the instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  

U.S. senators debated the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating he hasn't ruled out witness testimony, though he referenced the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a precedent. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argued that the trial must include witnesses and documents, warning that excluding them would make the process appear as a "sham trial." Trump, impeached by the Democratic-controlled House for abuse of power and obstructing Congress, accused Democrats of "delaying tactics" and demanded a swift resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate to pressure Republicans into agreeing to trial rules. McConnell emphasized that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles, while Trump criticized Pelosi, calling the process a "witch hunt" and "scam." Schumer requested subpoenaing four witnesses, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton, but the White House blocked their testimony. The trial's outcome is unlikely to remove Trump from office, given the Republican-controlled Senate.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
