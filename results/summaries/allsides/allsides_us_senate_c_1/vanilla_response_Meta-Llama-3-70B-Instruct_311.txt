SUMMARY:

US Senators are at odds over the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses, as demanded by Democrats. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insisted that the trial must include witnesses and urged the release of relevant Trump administration documents, warning that a trial without them would seem like a "sham trial". Trump, meanwhile, accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process. The House has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seeking to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an accord on trial rules.

END OF SUMMARY.
