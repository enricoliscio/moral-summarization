SUMMARY:

US Senators are at odds over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell hinting that he may consider hearing from witnesses, as demanded by Democrats. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a fair model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. However, Democrats argue that a trial without witnesses and documents would be a "sham trial" and "show trial". The impeachment process has been accused of being a "witch hunt" by Trump, who has been charged with abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. Trump has urged for a quick conclusion, accusing Democrats of delaying tactics. The Senate cannot take action until it receives the articles of impeachment from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is pressuring Senate Republicans to reach an accord on trial rules. Schumer has requested four witnesses to be subpoenaed, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, who were blocked from testifying during House proceedings.

END OF SUMMARY.
