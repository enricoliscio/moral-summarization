Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and specified certain morally charged words to include. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Key players are McConnell and Schumer, with differing views on whether to include witnesses. The author uses words like "fair," "trial," "pressuring," "abuse," "obstructing," "hold," "hunt," and "impeachment." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main conflict: Republicans, led by McConnell, are hesitant to allow witnesses, citing the Clinton trial as a model. Democrats, including Schumer, argue that without witnesses and documents, the trial would be seen as a sham. The article mentions that Trump was impeached by the House on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress. The Senate is unlikely to convict him, but the process is still contentious.

I'll structure the summary to include the key points: McConnell's stance, Schumer's demand, the comparison to the Clinton trial, the potential prolongation of the trial, and Trump's accusations. I'll make sure to use the specified moral words where appropriate. Also, I need to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft a concise version, ensuring all important elements are covered without losing the moral framing. I'll check that each of the author's words is included naturally in the summary. Finally, I'll review to ensure clarity and that the summary flows well within the word limit.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating that witness testimony has not been ruled out, though he wants to follow the 1999 Bill Clinton trial model. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without witnesses and documents would appear "sham" or "show," undermining its fairness. Trump faces charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, stemming from his pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to convict Trump, but Democrats seek to ensure a fair trial process. McConnell insists the Senate cannot act until the House delivers the articles of impeachment, while Trump accuses Democrats of delaying tactics and calls the process a "witch hunt." Schumer has requested subpoenaing four witnesses, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton, but the White House has blocked their testimony. The trial's fairness and integrity remain central to the debate. END OF SUMMARY.
