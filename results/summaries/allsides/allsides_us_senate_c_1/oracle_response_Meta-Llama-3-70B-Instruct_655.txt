SUMMARY: 

US Senators are at odds over the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting he may consider hearing from witnesses, as demanded by Democrats. McConnell cited the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. However, Democrats argue that a fair trial must include witnesses and relevant documents, or it would be seen as a "sham trial" by the American people. Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, has urged for a quick conclusion to the process, accusing Democrats of delaying tactics. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has withheld transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, pressuring Republicans to agree on trial rules. Trump has labeled the impeachment process a "Witch Hunt" and an "Impeachment Scam".
