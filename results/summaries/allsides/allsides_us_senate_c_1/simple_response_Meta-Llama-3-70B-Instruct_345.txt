SUMMARY:

The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is expected to begin in early 2020, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded. However, McConnell's approach is criticized as unfair and potentially damaging to Trump, as it may prolong the trial and bring up new evidence. Democrats, on the other hand, are pushing for a fair trial that includes witnesses and documents, arguing that without them, the trial would be a "sham" and lack credibility. The moral framing of this issue is clear: fairness, transparency, and accountability are at stake. The American people deserve a thorough and impartial trial, not a rushed or manipulated process that prioritizes partisan interests over the truth. By blocking witnesses and documents, the Trump administration and its allies are undermining the integrity of the impeachment process and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
