SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell stating that hearing witnesses, as Democrats have demanded, has not been ruled out. McConnell suggested following the precedent set by the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period before deciding on witnesses. Allowing witnesses, particularly from the administration, may lengthen the trial and potentially reveal damaging information about Trump, who was recently impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, insist on the necessity of witnesses and documents for a fair trial, arguing that without them, the process will appear as a sham to the American people. The impeachment stems from Trump's pressuring of Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, calling the impeachment a "Witch Hunt" and a "Scam." The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is delaying the transmission of impeachment articles to pressure Senate Republicans into agreeing on trial rules with Schumer. McConnell, however, maintains that the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles. END OF SUMMARY.
