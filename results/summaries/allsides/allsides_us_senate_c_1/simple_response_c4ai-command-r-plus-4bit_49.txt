SUMMARY: U.S. senators are currently debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell indicating that he is open to hearing witnesses, but has not yet committed to a Democratic request to agree on taking testimony in advance. McConnell suggested following the precedent set by the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. Allowing witnesses could prolong the trial and potentially reveal new damaging evidence against Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress. Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without documents and witnesses would be perceived as a sham by the American people. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of the articles of impeachment to pressure Senate Republicans to agree to trial rules, a tactic criticized by Trump as a delay. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, who were blocked by the White House from testifying in the House impeachment proceedings. The Senate trial is expected to begin in early 2020, and while Trump is unlikely to be convicted and removed from office, the debate over witness testimony could impact the length and outcome of the trial.
END OF SUMMARY.
