SUMMARY:

The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is set to begin in early 2020, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell hinting that he may allow witnesses to testify, as Democrats have demanded. However, McConnell's approach is seen as a stalling tactic, as he wants to follow the same process as the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which ended in acquittal. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are adamant that the trial must include witnesses and relevant documents, or it will be seen as a "sham trial". Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, has accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the process. The moral framing of this issue is clear: fairness and transparency are essential in a trial, and attempts to block witnesses and evidence are unjust and undermine the integrity of the process. McConnell's approach is seen as unfair and partisan, while Democrats are fighting for a fair and thorough trial.

END OF SUMMARY.
