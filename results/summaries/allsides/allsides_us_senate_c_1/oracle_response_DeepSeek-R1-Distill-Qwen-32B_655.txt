Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used, and they provided a list of morally framed words to include. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the debate between Republicans and Democrats over whether to include witnesses in the trial, McConnell's reference to the Clinton impeachment, the potential impact of witness testimony, and the political implications of the trial.

I need to make sure I include the morally charged words like "fair," "trial," "pressuring," "abuse," "obstructing," "hold," "hunt," and "impeachment." These words carry specific connotations that the author used, so I should use them appropriately in the summary.

I should start by mentioning the Senate's debate, then McConnell's stance and reference to the Clinton trial. Then, I'll note the Democrats' demand for witnesses and documents, the potential consequences of that, and Trump's accusations. Finally, I'll touch on Pelosi's strategy and the political dynamics.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I should avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to the facts presented in the article while maintaining the moral framing.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the debate, McConnell's position, Democrat's demands, implications, Trump's response, Pelosi's actions, and the overall political context. I'll make sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms where appropriate.

I also need to ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial.

Let me draft a version and check if it meets all the criteria. I'll make sure to include all the key points and the moral words without making it too lengthy. Once done, I'll review it to ensure it's accurate and maintains the author's framing.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting they follow the 1999 Bill Clinton trial model, which included limited witness testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that the trial must include witnesses and documents to avoid appearing as a "sham." Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and obstructing Congress. Schumer wants to subpoena key witnesses, but the White House has blocked their testimony. McConnell has not ruled out witnesses but emphasizes fairness, citing the Clinton trial. Trump accuses Democrats of delaying tactics and calls the process a "witch hunt." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the impeachment articles to the Senate, seeking Republican agreement on trial rules. The trial's outcome is unlikely to remove Trump, as the Senate is Republican-controlled. END OF SUMMARY.
