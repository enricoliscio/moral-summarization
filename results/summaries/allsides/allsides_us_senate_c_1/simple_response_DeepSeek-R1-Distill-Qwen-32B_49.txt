Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. The article is about the U.S. Senate's debate over the impeachment trial of President Trump. The key points are the conflict between Republicans and Democrats regarding witness testimony and the structure of the trial.

First, I'll identify the main elements: McConnell's stance on witnesses, comparison to Clinton's trial, Schumer's arguments, Pelosi's actions, Trump's accusations, and the blocked witnesses. I should highlight the tension between fairness and partisanship, as that's the moral angle.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the essence without losing the moral perspective. I'll structure it to show both sides' arguments, emphasizing the fairness aspect as McConnell mentions and the potential for a sham trial as Schumer warns.

Also, I should note the political implications, like the low chance of conviction and Trump's campaign rhetoric. Keeping it balanced but highlighting the moral framing is crucial. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, covering each point without getting bogged down in details.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning the blocked witnesses and Pelosi's strategy, tying it back to the overall debate's fairness. That should cover all necessary points while maintaining the moral context.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republicans and Democrats clashing over whether to allow witness testimony. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has not ruled out witnesses but wants to follow the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment model, which included limited testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that excluding witnesses and documents would make the trial appear sham-like, while Trump accuses Democrats of delaying tactics. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate to pressure Republicans into agreeing on trial rules. Trump, who faces charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, has denied wrongdoing. The trial's fairness and transparency are central to the debate, with Schumer requesting four witnesses, all blocked by the White House, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton. END OF SUMMARY.
