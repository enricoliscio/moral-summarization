SUMMARY: 
There is debate among senators about the format of U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republicans and Democrats disagreeing on whether to include witnesses. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has not ruled out witnesses but has suggested following the format of President Clinton's impeachment trial, which included limited testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without witnesses and documents would be a "sham trial" and a "show trial." The House of Representatives has impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, stemming from his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate Biden, his political rival. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and referred to the impeachment as a "Witch Hunt" and a "Scam." The trial is expected to begin in early 2020, and there is little chance of Trump being convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate. The debate continues over whether witnesses with potentially damaging testimony will be included in the trial.
END OF SUMMARY.
