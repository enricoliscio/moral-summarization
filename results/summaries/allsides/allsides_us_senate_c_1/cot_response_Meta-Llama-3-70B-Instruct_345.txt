SUMMARY:
US Senators are at odds over the format of President Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell suggesting he may consider hearing from witnesses, as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after opening arguments and a written question period. Democrats, however, are pushing for witnesses to be subpoenaed, including current and former administration officials, which could prolong the trial and bring up new evidence damaging to Trump. Senator Chuck Schumer warned that a trial without witnesses and documents would seem like a "sham trial" to the American people. Trump, meanwhile, accused Democrats of "delaying tactics" and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, calling it a "Witch Hunt" and an "Impeachment Scam". END OF SUMMARY.
