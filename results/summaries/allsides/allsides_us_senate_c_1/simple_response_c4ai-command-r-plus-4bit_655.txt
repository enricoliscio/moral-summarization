SUMMARY: The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is shaping up to be a contentious battle in the Senate, with Republicans and Democrats sparring over the inclusion of witnesses and documents. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has not ruled out witnesses but has suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited video testimony. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without documents and witnesses would be perceived as a "sham trial" by the American people. The House of Representatives has impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress, but the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to convict and remove him from office. Trump has called for a quick trial, accusing Democrats of delaying tactics, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has withheld the articles of impeachment to pressure Senate Republicans into agreeing to trial rules with Schumer. Schumer has requested subpoenas for key witnesses, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, both of whom were blocked by the White House from testifying in the House impeachment proceedings. The debate over witnesses and documents highlights the moral imperative of a fair and transparent trial, with Democrats arguing that a trial without them would be unjust and a disservice to the American people.
