SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the format of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell indicating that he is open to hearing witnesses but has not made a final decision. McConnell suggested following the model of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which included a written question period and limited witness testimony. Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, argued that a trial without witnesses and documents would be perceived as a sham by the American people. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation into his dealings with Ukraine. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and it is unlikely that he will be convicted and removed from office by the Republican-controlled Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is delaying the transmission of the articles of impeachment to pressure Senate Republicans to agree to trial rules with Schumer. Schumer has requested subpoenas for four key witnesses, but the White House previously blocked their testimony during House impeachment proceedings.
END OF SUMMARY.
