SUMMARY:
U.S. senators are at odds over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell saying he hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses as Democrats have demanded. McConnell cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, saying "Fair is fair." However, Democrats argue that a trial without witnesses and documents would be a "sham trial, a show trial." Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, accused Democrats of "delaying tactics" and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process, calling it a "Witch Hunt" and a "Scam." Trump also lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling her "Crazy Nancy" and saying she has a "bad case." The trial is expected to begin in early 2020, but Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, seeking to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an accord with Democrats on trial rules.
