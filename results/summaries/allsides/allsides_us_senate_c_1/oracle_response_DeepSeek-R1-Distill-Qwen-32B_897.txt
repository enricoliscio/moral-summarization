Okay, I need to summarize the provided news article while preserving the moral framing words used by the author. The article is about the U.S. Senate's discussions on the impeachment trial of President Trump. The key points are the debate between Republicans and Democrats on whether to include witnesses, McConnell's reference to the Clinton trial, Schumer's emphasis on documents and witnesses, the charges against Trump, and the political implications.

I should start by identifying the main elements: the Senate's arguments, McConnell's stance, Schumer's demands, the Clinton trial precedent, the potential impact of witnesses, Trump's accusations, Pelosi's strategy, and the blocked witnesses. I need to include the moral terms like "fair," "trial," "pressuring," "abuse," "obstructing," "hunt," and "impeachment."

I'll structure the summary to first mention the senators' debate, McConnell's position referencing the Clinton trial, Schumer's call for witnesses and documents, the charges against Trump, Pelosi's actions, Trump's criticism, and the blocked witnesses. I'll ensure each moral term is included naturally within the summary without exceeding 200 words.

SUMMARY: U.S. senators are debating the structure of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, with Republicans and Democrats clashing over whether to include witness testimony. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has not ruled out witnesses but referenced the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a precedent, emphasizing fairness. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, argue that a trial without documents and witnesses would appear sham-like, urging the release of relevant Trump administration documents. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and obstructing Congress, charges he denies. McConnell insists the Senate cannot act until it receives the articles of impeachment, while Trump accuses Democrats of delaying tactics and calls the process a witch hunt. Schumer wants to subpoena four witnesses, including Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton, but the White House has blocked their testimony. The trial's outcome is unlikely to remove Trump from office, given the Republican-controlled Senate. END OF SUMMARY.
