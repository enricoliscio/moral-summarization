SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "false and untrue," and has accused the newspaper of a politically motivated attack. The Washington Post report was based on interviews with over 30 people and included allegations of sexual contact with a minor, which could have been considered sexual offenses at the time. Moore has denied the claims and called the allegations "fake news," promising "revelations" about the story in the coming days. Several Republicans have withdrawn their support for Moore following the article, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which severed a joint fundraising agreement with Moore's campaign. The Washington Post has declined to comment on Moore's threat of legal action.

END OF SUMMARY.
