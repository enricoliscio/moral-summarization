Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points. The article is about Roy Moore suing The Washington Post over allegations of pursuing teenagers when he was in his 30s. The author uses several morally charged words like "pursued," "attacks," "false," and "misconduct." My task is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without losing the moral tone.

I should start by identifying the main events: Moore's threat to sue, the content of the Washington Post's report, his denials, and the reactions from others. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the morally framed terms. 

I'll structure the summary by first mentioning Moore's decision to sue, then the allegations made by the Post, his denial, and the impact on his campaign. I'll also include his claims about the attacks on his character and the ongoing investigations. I need to ensure that words like "pursued," "attacks," "false," and "misconduct" are included to maintain the moral framing.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions or additional information beyond what's in the article. Keeping it factual but highlighting the moral language is crucial. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically, covering the threat, the allegations, denials, and consequences. Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has vowed to sue The Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the claims "false" and "untrue," accusing the Post of launching an "attack" on his character to derail his campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, includes allegations of sexual contact with a 14-year-old and three other women when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and emphasizing his "highest regard for the protection of young children." He also claimed the incidents occurred nearly 40 years ago and accused the media of "very hurtful" attacks. Despite the allegations, Moore stated he has never provided alcohol to minors or engaged in sexual misconduct. Several Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, withdrew their endorsements following the report. Moore hinted at ongoing "investigations" into the article's motivations, promising future "revelations." END OF SUMMARY.
