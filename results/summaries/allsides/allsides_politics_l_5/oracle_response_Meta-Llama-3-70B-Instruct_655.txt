SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s, calling them "completely false" and "fake news". The Washington Post report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleges that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. The 14-year-old claimed Moore took her to his house, undressed her, and touched her, which could have been sexual offenses due to her age. Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post, calling the allegations "attacks" on his character and reputation. He has also claimed that there are ongoing "investigations" into the motivations behind the article and promised "revelations" to come. Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the report, citing concerns over his alleged misconduct.
