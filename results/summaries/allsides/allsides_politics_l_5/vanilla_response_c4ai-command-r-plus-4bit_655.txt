SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore announced his intention to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "false and untrue," and claimed they were an attempt to discredit his political campaign. The Washington Post's report was based on interviews with over 30 people and included allegations of sexual contact with a minor and pursuit of relationships with teenagers. Moore has denied the claims, calling them "fake news" and "attacks on his character." He also suggested that there would be "revelations" about the motivations behind the article. Following the report, several Republicans withdrew their endorsements of Moore, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
