SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue The Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the allegations "completely false" and "fake news" and claimed they were a desperate attempt to stop his political campaign. The Washington Post report was based on interviews with over 30 people, including four women who alleged Moore pursued them when they were between 16 and 18 years old. One woman claimed Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14, which could have been a sexual offense due to her age, but the statute of limitations has passed. Moore has denied the allegations and claimed there are ongoing "investigations" into the motivations behind the Post article, promising "revelations" to come in the next few days.

END OF SUMMARY.
