SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report that he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "false and untrue attacks" on his character and reputation. The Washington Post report, based on interviews with over 30 people, claimed that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. While Moore has denied any wrongdoing and called the allegations "fake news," several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements, citing the serious nature of the claims. The story has sparked a debate about the protection of young people and the ethical conduct expected of public figures. Moore has promised "revelations" about the story and investigations into the motivations behind it. It remains to be seen whether Moore will follow through with legal action, but the allegations have already had a significant impact on his campaign and public image. END OF SUMMARY.
