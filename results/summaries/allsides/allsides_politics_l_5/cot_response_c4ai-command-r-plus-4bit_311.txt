SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore plans to sue the Washington Post over an article that claimed he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Moore calls the article a desperate attack on his character and reputation, denying the allegations as completely false and untrue. The Washington Post has declined to comment. While it is common for public figures to threaten legal action against news organizations, they often fail to follow through. The article, based on allegations of sexual misconduct, claims that Moore committed sexual offenses due to the girl's age, but the statutes of limitations have passed. Moore has denied the accusations, calling them fake news and expressing his regard for the protection of young children. He also denied any guilt of sexual misconduct and promised to reveal the motivations behind the article. Following the publication, several Republicans withdrew their endorsements of Moore and severed their fundraising agreement with his campaign.
END OF SUMMARY.
