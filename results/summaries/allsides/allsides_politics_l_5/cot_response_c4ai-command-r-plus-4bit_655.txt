SUMMARY: Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the US Senate in Alabama, has vowed to sue the Washington Post over allegations of sexual misconduct. Moore claims that the Post's report, which includes accounts from four women, is a desperate attack on his character and reputation, and that the allegations are false and untrue. The Washington Post report details accounts from four women, one of whom was 14 years old at the time, alleging that Moore pursued sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them fake news and expressing his highest regard for the protection of young children. He has also promised that there will be investigations and revelations about the motivations behind the story. In the wake of the allegations, several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which severed a joint fundraising agreement with his campaign.
