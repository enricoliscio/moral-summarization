Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore suing The Washington Post. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article says that Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, is suing The Washington Post over their report alleging he had sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old when he was 32. Moore claims these allegations are false and part of an attempt to derail his campaign. The Post hasn't commented yet, but it's noted that public figures often threaten lawsuits but don't follow through, like Trump and Weinstein.

The article details the Post's report, which is based on over 30 interviews. It mentions the 14-year-old incident, which could be a sexual offense but is past the statute of limitations. The other three women didn't claim harassment or assault, just that Moore pursued them when they were 16-18. Alabama's legal age is 16, so the 14-year-old case is more serious.

Moore denies all allegations, calls them "fake news," and mentions that the incidents were 40 years ago. He claims he's never provided alcohol to minors or engaged in sexual misconduct. He also says there are ongoing investigations into the Post's motivations and promises more revelations soon. Some Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements after the article.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with Moore suing the Post, the allegations, his denial, the age of consent, and the consequences like endorsements being withdrawn. I should also mention that while he threatens legal action, such cases often don't result in lawsuits.

Let me structure it: Moore's threat to sue, the nature of the allegations, his response, the age of consent, the lack of harassment claims from others, and the political fallout. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
