SUMMARY:
Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the US Senate in Alabama, has vowed to sue the Washington Post over allegations of sexual misconduct. Moore claims the newspaper is launching a desperate attack on his character and reputation with false accusations. The Washington Post report alleges that Moore pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Moore has vehemently denied the claims, calling them completely false and untrue. He characterizes the allegations as fake news and maintains that he has never been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone. Moore also promises revelations about the motivations behind the article. This story has caused a moral panic among Republicans, with some withdrawing their endorsements of Moore. The party seems to be concerned about the moral implications of the allegations and their potential impact on Moore's campaign and the party's reputation.
