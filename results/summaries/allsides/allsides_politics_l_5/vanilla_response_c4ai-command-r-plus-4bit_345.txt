SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore plans to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations since they were published, calling them "completely false" and "fake news." He also claimed that the alleged incidents happened nearly 40 years ago and that he has never been guilty of sexual misconduct. The Washington Post report was based on interviews with over 30 people, including four women who claimed Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 14 and 18. Moore has faced backlash from Republicans, with some withdrawing their endorsements and severing fundraising agreements. It remains to be seen if Moore will follow through with legal action, as public figures often threaten but don't always sue.
END OF SUMMARY.
