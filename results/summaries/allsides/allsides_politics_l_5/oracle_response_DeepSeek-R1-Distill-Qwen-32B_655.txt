Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally charged words, and I should make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, is suing The Washington Post over their report alleging he had sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. The article mentions that Moore called the report an attack on his character and reputation, which are strong moral words. He claims the allegations are false and untrue, which are also from the list. 

The Post's report is based on interviews with over 30 people, including a 14-year-old and three others who were between 16 and 18. The 14-year-old's allegations could have been sexual offenses, but the statute of limitations has passed. The other women didn't claim harassment or assault. Moore denies everything, calling the claims fake news and part of a desperate attempt to stop his campaign. He emphasizes that the incidents were 40 years ago and expresses concern for the protection of children. 

Some Republicans withdrew their endorsements after the article. Moore is promising revelations soon but hasn't provided details. 

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes words like "pursued," "attack," "attacks," "false," "untrue," "touched," "misconduct," "contact," "took," "undressed," "moved," "touch," "offenses," "harassed," "assaulted," "forced," "protection." 

I should structure the summary to include Moore's accusations against the Post, the nature of the allegations, his denials, and the consequences like endorsements being withdrawn. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including the moral terms.

I'll start by mentioning Moore suing the Post, then the allegations, his response, the lack of legal action from others, the details of the report, his denial, the use of "fake news," the time frame, his claims about protection, the other women's accounts, and the endorsements being withdrawn. I'll make sure to include all the necessary moral terms without making it sound forced.
