Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore suing The Washington Post. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by saying that Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, plans to sue The Washington Post for their report about him pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old when he was in his 30s. Moore claims these allegations are false and part of a desperate attempt to stop his campaign.

I should note that The Washington Post hasn't commented yet. It's mentioned that public figures often threaten lawsuits but don't follow through, like Trump and Weinstein. The Post's report is based on over 30 interviews, including three women who were 16-18 when Moore allegedly pursued them. One woman was 14, and the actions described could have been sexual offenses, but the statute of limitations has passed. The other women didn't claim harassment or assault.

Moore denies all allegations, calling them fake news and part of a campaign to stop him. He mentioned that the incidents were 40 years ago and that he respects children's protection. He also says he hasn't provided alcohol to minors or engaged in sexual misconduct. He's talking about ongoing investigations and promises more revelations, but hasn't provided specifics.

Additionally, several Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, withdrew their endorsements after the article, ending a joint fundraising agreement.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Moore suing The Post, the nature of the allegations, his denial, the context of other public figures not following through on lawsuits, the details of the Post's report, and the political fallout with endorsements being withdrawn.

Let me structure this clearly, ensuring each main point is covered concisely.
