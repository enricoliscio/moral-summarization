SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s, calling them "completely false" and "fake news". Moore claims the Washington Post's report is an "attack" on his character and reputation, and has threatened to sue the publication. The report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleges that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. The 14-year-old alleged that Moore took her to his house, undressed her, and touched her, which could have been sexual offenses due to her age. Moore has denied all allegations, calling them "very hurtful" and stating that he has the "highest regard for the protection of young children". Despite his denials, several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
