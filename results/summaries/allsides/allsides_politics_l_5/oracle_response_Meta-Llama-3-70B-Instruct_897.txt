SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore claims the attacks on his character and reputation are "false and untrue" and vows to take legal action. The Washington Post report, based on interviews with over 30 people, details allegations of Moore's sexual misconduct, including touching a 14-year-old girl and pursuing relationships with three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and "completely false". He claims the alleged incidents happened nearly 40 years ago and are "very hurtful to me personally". Moore has promised "revelations" about the story to come in the next few days, but did not provide further specifics. Following the report, several Republicans withdrew their endorsements of Moore, citing concerns over his protection of young children.
