SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s, calling the claims "completely false" and "fake news". He accused The Washington Post of launching a "desperate attack" on his character and reputation to stop his political campaign. Moore threatened to sue the Post, but the newspaper declined to comment. The allegations, based on interviews with over 30 people, include a claim that Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old, which could have been a sexual offense due to her age. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "very hurtful" and stating that he has the "highest regard for the protection of young children". Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the report. END OF SUMMARY.
