Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore suing the Washington Post. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, says he'll sue the Washington Post for their report about him having sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. The Post's report included claims that he was involved with a 14-year-old and others when they were 16-18. Moore denies all these allegations, calling them fake news and part of a campaign to stop his political efforts.

The article also mentions that while public figures often threaten lawsuits, they rarely follow through. Examples include Trump and Weinstein, who both threatened but didn't sue. The Post's report was based on over 30 interviews, but none of the women accused Moore of harassment or assault, just that he pursued them. Alabama's legal age is 16, so some actions might have been illegal, but the statutes of limitations have passed.

Moore has denied everything, emphasizing his respect for children and that he's never had inappropriate conduct. He also mentioned ongoing investigations into the article's motives and promised more revelations soon. Some Republicans withdrew their support after the article.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Moore's threat to sue, the allegations, his denials, the context of past threats, the basis of the Post's report, the legal aspects, and the political fallout.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Moore's threat, then the allegations, his response, the rarity of such lawsuits, the details of the Post's report, the legal age and implications, his denials, and the consequences like endorsements being withdrawn.

I should make sure the summary is concise, hitting each main point without going into too much detail. Also, keep it in the user's requested format, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me put it all together, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows logically.
