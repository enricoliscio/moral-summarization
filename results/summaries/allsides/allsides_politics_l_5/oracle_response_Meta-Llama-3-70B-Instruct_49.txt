SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore claims the allegations are "false and untrue" and an "attack" on his character and reputation. The report, based on interviews with over 30 people, details how Moore allegedly took a 14-year-old to his house, undressed her, and touched her, which could have been sexual offenses due to her age. Three other women also accused Moore of pursuing them when they were between 16 and 18. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and "fake news." He claims to have the "highest regard for the protection of young children" and has never been "guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone." Despite his denials, several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore, citing the seriousness of the allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
