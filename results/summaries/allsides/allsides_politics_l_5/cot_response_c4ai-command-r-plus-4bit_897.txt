SUMMARY: 
Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the US Senate in Alabama, has vowed to sue the Washington Post over allegations of sexual misconduct. Moore claims the Post is desperate to stop his campaign by publishing false accusations that he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. He denies the allegations, calling them "completely false," "untrue," and "fake news." Moore insists he has done nothing inappropriate, and that these incidents, which allegedly took place nearly 40 years ago, are very hurtful to him personally. He also asserts his innocence regarding any sexual misconduct and providing alcohol to minors. Moore promises that ongoing investigations will reveal the truth behind the Post's article. Some Republicans have withdrawn their support for Moore in light of these serious allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
