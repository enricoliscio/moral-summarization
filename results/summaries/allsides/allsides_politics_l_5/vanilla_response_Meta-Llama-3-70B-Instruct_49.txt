SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore claims the allegations are "false and untrue" and an attack on his character and reputation. The Washington Post report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleges that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women when they were between 16 and 18 years old. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and claiming they are a desperate attempt to stop his political campaign. Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the report. Moore has promised "revelations" about the story to come in the next few days, but did not provide further specifics.
