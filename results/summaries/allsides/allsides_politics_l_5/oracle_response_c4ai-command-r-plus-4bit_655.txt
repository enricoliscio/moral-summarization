SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over an article alleging that he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "false and untrue attacks" on his character and reputation. The article included interviews with more than 30 people and claimed that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued relationships with three other women aged 16 to 18. While Moore has denied any wrongdoing and called the allegations "fake news," several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of him. The Washington Post declined to comment on Moore's threat of legal action. This incident adds to a growing list of public figures threatening to sue media organizations over allegations of sexual misconduct, including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein, though often these lawsuits never materialize.
