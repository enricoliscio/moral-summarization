SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and "fake news." He claimed that the allegations were made to stop his political campaign and damage his character and reputation. The Washington Post report was based on interviews with over 30 people and included allegations of sexual contact with a minor, which could have been considered sexual offenses at the time. Moore has denied any wrongdoing and promised "revelations" about the story in the coming days. Following the article's publication, several Republicans withdrew their endorsements of Moore, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
