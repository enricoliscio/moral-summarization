Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, is suing the Washington Post over their report that he had sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. He claims the allegations are false and part of an attempt to stop his campaign. The Post's report is based on interviews with over 30 people, including a 14-year-old and three other women who were 16-18. Moore denies everything, calls it fake news, and says he's never done anything wrong. Some Republicans have withdrawn their support.

Now, the user wants a summary that's under 200 words, preserving the moral framing. So I need to highlight the key points: Moore suing, the allegations, his denial, the impact on his campaign, and the moral implications.

I should mention that the allegations involve minors, which is a serious moral issue. Also, Moore's response and the fact that he's suing despite the statute of limitations. The fact that some Republicans withdrew support shows the political fallout.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll structure it by stating Moore's legal action, the nature of the allegations, his denial, the source of the report, the legal age context, his campaign's response, and the political consequences.

Let me make sure I don't include any extra details beyond what's necessary for the summary. Also, ensure that the moral framing is clear, emphasizing the allegations against minors and Moore's denial.

Putting it all together, I'll draft the summary, keeping each sentence focused on the main points without getting bogged down in specifics. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.
