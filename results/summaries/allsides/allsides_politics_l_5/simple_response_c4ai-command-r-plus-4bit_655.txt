SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over an article alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "false and untrue," and claiming that the story is a desperate attempt to stop his political campaign. The Washington Post report was based on interviews with over 30 people and included allegations of sexual contact with a minor, which could have been considered sexual offenses at the time. Moore has strongly refuted the claims, stating that he has never been guilty of sexual misconduct and has the highest regard for the protection of young children. He has also promised "revelations" about the story and ongoing investigations into the motivations behind the article. Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the allegations, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
END OF SUMMARY.
