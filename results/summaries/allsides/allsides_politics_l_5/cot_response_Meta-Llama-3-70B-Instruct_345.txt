SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s, calling the claims "completely false" and "fake news". Moore accused The Washington Post of launching a "desperate" attack on his character and reputation to stop his political campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleged that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. Moore has threatened to sue The Washington Post over the report, which he claims is "hurtful" to him personally. He emphasized his "highest regard for the protection of young children" and denied any "sexual misconduct" with anyone. Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the report. END OF SUMMARY.
