SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s, calling them "completely false" and "fake news". The Washington Post report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleges that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women between the ages of 16 and 18. The 14-year-old claimed Moore took her to his house, undressed her, and touched her, which could have been sexual offenses due to her age. Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post, claiming the report is an "attack" on his character and reputation. However, it's not uncommon for public figures to threaten legal action but ultimately fail to follow through. The allegations have led to several Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of Moore, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Moore has promised "revelations" about the story to come in the next few days, but has not provided further specifics. END OF SUMMARY.
