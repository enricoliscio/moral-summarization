SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has vowed to sue the Washington Post over its recent report accusing him of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl, decades ago. Moore vehemently denies these scandalous allegations, calling them "completely false," "fake news," and "hurtful." He refutes any wrongdoing, stating that he has never been guilty of sexual misconduct or providing alcohol to minors. The Washington Post's expos√©, based on interviews with over 30 individuals, details accounts of Moore's inappropriate behavior with underage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore has threatened legal action against the publication, yet it remains to be seen if he will follow through on his promise, as public figures often make similar threats without taking legal steps. The repercussions of these allegations have already been felt, with several Republicans withdrawing their support for Moore and ending fundraising agreements with his campaign. Moore, however, remains defiant, promising "revelations" about the story and "investigations" into the motivations behind it. END OF SUMMARY.
