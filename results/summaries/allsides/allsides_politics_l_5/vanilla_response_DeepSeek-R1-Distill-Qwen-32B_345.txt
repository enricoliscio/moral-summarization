Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. They want the summary to be concise, under 200 words, and they specified the format with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully. The main points are about Roy Moore threatening to sue The Washington Post for their report on his alleged past behavior with minors. The article also mentions how other public figures have made similar threats but didn't follow through, which is a good context to include.

I should identify the key elements: who, what, when, where, why. Roy Moore is the candidate, he's suing over the Post's report, the allegations involve minors, and he's denying the claims. Also, some Republicans have withdrawn their support, which is an important consequence.

I need to make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the main facts without getting too detailed. I'll also check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. 

Putting it all together, the summary should mention Moore's threat, the nature of the allegations, his denial, the historical context of similar threats, and the impact on his campaign. I'll structure it in a logical flow, starting with the threat, the allegations, his response, and the consequences.

Finally, I'll make sure to end with the specified tokens as the user requested. Double-checking everything to ensure clarity and conciseness.

SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue The Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the claims "false and untrue," accusing the Post of attacking his character to derail his campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, includes allegations that Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old and pursued other women when they were minors. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and claiming the incidents, which occurred nearly 40 years ago, are hurtful but not indicative of his character. He also mentioned ongoing investigations into the motivations behind the article. Several Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the report. END OF SUMMARY.
