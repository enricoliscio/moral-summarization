SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the allegations "completely false" and "fake news" and claimed they were a desperate attempt to stop his political campaign. The Washington Post report was based on interviews with over 30 people and included allegations from four women who claimed Moore pursued them when they were between 16 and 18 years old. One of the women alleged Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14, but the statute of limitations has passed. Moore has denied the allegations and claimed there are ongoing "investigations" into the motivations behind the Post article. Following the report, several Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, withdrew their endorsements of Moore.
