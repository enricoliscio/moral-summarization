SUMMARY: Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate from Alabama, has vowed to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "completely false" and "fake news." He claimed that the Post published the story to stop his political campaign and damage his character and reputation. The Post's report was based on interviews with over 30 people and included allegations that Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old and pursued relationships with other underage girls. Moore has denied any wrongdoing and promised "revelations" about the story in the coming days. Following the report, several Republicans withdrew their endorsements of Moore, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which severed a joint fundraising agreement with Moore's campaign.
