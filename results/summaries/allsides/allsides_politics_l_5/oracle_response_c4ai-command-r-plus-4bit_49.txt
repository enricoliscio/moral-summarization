SUMMARY: Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the US Senate in Alabama, has vowed to sue the Washington Post over an article alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Moore claims the report is a desperate attack on his character and reputation by a newspaper attempting to derail his campaign. The article includes interviews with over 30 people and details allegations of sexual misconduct and offenses by Moore. Moore has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them completely false and untrue, and characterizing them as fake news. He has also promised "revelations" about the motivations behind the article. Despite Moore's denials, several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements, citing the seriousness of the accusations. The Washington Post has declined to comment on Moore's threat of legal action. This incident adds to a growing list of public figures threatening to sue media outlets over allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment, with varying outcomes.
END OF SUMMARY.
