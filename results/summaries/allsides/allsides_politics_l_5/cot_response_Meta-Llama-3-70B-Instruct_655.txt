SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. He claims the reports are "false" and "untrue" and vows to sue the Washington Post for attacking his "character" and "reputation". Moore's campaign has been marred by allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has repeatedly denied, calling them "fake news". Despite the allegations, Moore has maintained that he has the "highest regard" for the protection of young children and has never been "guilty" of sexual misconduct. The Washington Post report, based on interviews with over 30 people, has led to several Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of Moore. The scandal has sparked an investigation into the motivations behind the Post article, with Moore promising "revelations" to come. END OF SUMMARY.
