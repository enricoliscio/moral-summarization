Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore suing The Washington Post. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing, so I should focus on the words the author used like "pursued," "attack," "false," etc.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Roy Moore is suing because the Post accused him of having sexual contact with minors. He called the report an attack on his character and reputation. The Post's report is based on interviews with over 30 people, including a 14-year-old when he was 32. Three other women also said he pursued them when they were 16-18. The article mentions that none of the women claimed harassment or assault, but the age of consent in Alabama is 16. Moore denies everything, calls it fake news, and mentions past incidents 40 years ago. He's also talking about ongoing investigations and possible revelations. Some Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally charged words. I'll start by stating Moore's decision to sue, using "attack" and "false." I'll mention the allegations of pursuing minors, using "pursued," "contact," "undressed," etc. I'll note that Moore denies everything, calling the claims "false" and "untrue." Also, include that the allegations are 40 years old and he's talking about investigations. Finally, mention the loss of endorsements.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary framing words without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has vowed to sue The Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore accused the Post of launching an "attack" on his character and reputation to derail his campaign. The report, based on interviews with over 30 individuals, includes claims of sexual contact with minors, including undressing and touching. Moore denies the allegations, calling them "false" and "untrue," and emphasizes his commitment to the "protection" of children. He also claims the incidents occurred nearly 40 years ago and are "very hurtful." Moore has not been accused of harassment, assault, or forcing relationships, though the age of consent in Alabama is 16. He has dismissed the claims as "fake news" and hinted at ongoing "investigations" into the Post's motivations. Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements following the allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
