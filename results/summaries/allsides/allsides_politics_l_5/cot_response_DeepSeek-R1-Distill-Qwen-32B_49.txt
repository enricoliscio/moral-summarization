Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the context and the key points.

The article is about Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican Senate candidate, suing The Washington Post over their report alleging he had sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. The moral framing here is important, so I need to identify words that carry moral connotations.

In STEP 1, I have to list all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "attack," "false," "untrue," "desperate," "sued," "sexual," "harass," "assault," "force," "revelations," "endorsements," "severed," "benefits," "protect," "honesty," "transparency," and "credibility." These words carry moral weight and are crucial for the summary.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll start by stating Moore's decision to sue The Washington Post. Then, I'll mention the allegations and his denial, highlighting his claims of "false" and "untrue." I should also include his accusations against the Post, such as "attack" and "desperate." 

I'll note the details from the Post's report, including the age of the individuals involved and Moore's response about the statute of limitations. It's important to mention that none of the women accused him of harassment or assault, just that one reached the age of consent. 

I'll also touch on Moore's personal statements, his claims about protecting children, and the political fallout, like endorsements being withdrawn. Finally, I'll include his promise of "revelations" to come, which adds a layer of anticipation and his attempt to defend his reputation.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Moore's legal action, moving through the allegations and his denials, the political consequences, and ending with his future plans. Keeping the language concise while preserving the moral framing is key here.

**SUMMARY:**  
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has vowed to sue *The Washington Post* over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the claims "false" and "untrue," accusing the newspaper of launching a "desperate" attack on his character to derail his campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, includes allegations of sexual contact with a 14-year-old and three other women when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and emphasizing his "highest regard for the protection of young children." He also claimed that the alleged incidents occurred nearly 40 years ago and that the statute of limitations has expired. While none of the women accused him of harassment or assault, one reached the age of consent in Alabama (16). Moore promised "revelations" about the story soon but provided no details. Several Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore, citing the allegations.  
END OF SUMMARY.
