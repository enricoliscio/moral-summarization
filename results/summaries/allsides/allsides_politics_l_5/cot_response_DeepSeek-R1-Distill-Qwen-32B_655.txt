Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what moral framing means here. It refers to words that carry a moral judgment, like "false," "desperate," or "sexual misconduct." 

I'll start by reading the article carefully. It's about Roy Moore suing the Washington Post over allegations of pursuing teenagers. The article mentions several morally charged words. I'll list them out as per the user's instruction.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include those moral terms. I'll focus on the key points: Moore's lawsuit threat, the allegations, the responses from him and others, and the impact on his campaign. I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the moral aspects highlighted in the original text.

I should also check if I'm using the right words and if the summary flows logically. It's important to maintain the balance between factual reporting and the moral implications as presented by the author. I'll make sure each point is clear and that the summary doesn't omit any critical information.

**SUMMARY:**  
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has vowed to sue *The Washington Post* over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the claims "false and untrue," accusing the newspaper of launching a "desperate" attack on his character to derail his campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, included allegations of sexual contact with a 14-year-old and three other women when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denied the claims, labeling them "fake news" and emphasizing that the alleged incidents occurred nearly 40 years ago. He also stated he had "the highest regard for the protection of young children" and had never engaged in sexual misconduct. Moore claimed ongoing "investigations" would reveal the motivations behind the article. Meanwhile, several Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, withdrew their endorsements, severing a joint fundraising agreement that benefited his campaign. Moore has yet to file a lawsuit, as is common with such threats from public figures. END OF SUMMARY.
