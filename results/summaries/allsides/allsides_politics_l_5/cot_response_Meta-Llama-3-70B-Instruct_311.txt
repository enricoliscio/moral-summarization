SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s, calling the claims "completely false" and "fake news". Moore threatened to sue the Washington Post over the report, which he claimed was a "desperate" attempt to stop his political campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleged that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women when they were between 16 and 18. Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "very hurtful to me personally" and stating that he has the "highest regard for the protection of young children". Despite his denials, several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore, citing the "serious" nature of the allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
