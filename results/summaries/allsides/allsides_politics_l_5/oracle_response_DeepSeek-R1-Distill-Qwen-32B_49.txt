Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Roy Moore suing the Washington Post. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing, so I should use the same words the author used. Let me read through the article again.

Roy Moore threatens to sue the Post over their report about him pursuing teenagers when he was in his 30s. The report says he had sexual contact with a 14-year-old and others. Moore claims the allegations are false and part of an attack on his reputation. The Post hasn't commented yet. I should include words like "pursued," "attack," "false," "sexual contact," etc.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Moore's threat to sue. Then mention the allegations, using the specific terms. Include his denial and the impact on his campaign. Also, note that the Post hasn't responded and that similar threats from others haven't led to lawsuits. Finally, mention that some Republicans have withdrawn support.

I should structure it to flow logically: Moore's threat, the nature of the allegations, his response, the Post's stance, and the consequences. Make sure to include all the key moral terms without making it too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue the Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore claims the allegations are false and part of an attack on his character and reputation to derail his campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, includes claims of sexual contact with the 14-year-old and other women when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denies the allegations, calling them "completely false" and "fake news," and emphasizes his commitment to the protection of children. He also accuses the media of a "desperate attempt" to stop his campaign. While Moore has not been accused of harassment, assault, or forcing relationships, the allegations could constitute sexual offenses due to the victims' ages. The legal age of consent in Alabama is 16. Moore has accused the Post of bias and promised revelations about the story's origins. Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of him following the report. END OF SUMMARY.
