SUMMARY:
Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. He called the claims "completely false" and "fake news" and threatened to sue The Washington Post, accusing them of launching a "desperate" attack on his character and reputation to stop his political campaign. Moore claimed the allegations were "very hurtful to me personally" and emphasized his "highest regard for the protection of young children." However, several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore, citing the seriousness of the allegations. The Washington Post report was based on interviews with over 30 people, including four women who alleged Moore pursued them when they were between 16 and 18 years old. END OF SUMMARY.
