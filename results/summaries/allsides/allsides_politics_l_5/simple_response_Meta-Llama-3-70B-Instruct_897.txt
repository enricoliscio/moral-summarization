SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has denied allegations of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. He claims the Washington Post report is a "desperate" attempt to stop his political campaign and has threatened to sue the newspaper. However, it's common for public figures to make such threats without following through. The report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleges that Moore had sexual contact with the 14-year-old and pursued three other women when they were between 16 and 18. While Moore has denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and "completely false", several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of him. Moore's response raises concerns about his character and commitment to protecting young children, as he claims to have the "highest regard" for their protection. The incident has sparked outrage and raised questions about Moore's fitness for public office.
