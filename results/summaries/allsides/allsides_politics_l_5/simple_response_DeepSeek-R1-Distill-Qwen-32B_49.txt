Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Roy Moore suing The Washington Post for their report on his alleged sexual misconduct with minors. Moore claims the report is an attack on his character to stop his campaign. The Post's report is based on interviews with over 30 people, including a 14-year-old when he was 32. Moore denies all allegations, calls them fake news, and says he's never engaged in sexual misconduct. Some Republicans have withdrawn their support. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects. The article presents Moore as someone defending his reputation against false allegations, while also highlighting the serious nature of the accusations. I should include both sides: Moore's denial and the fact that the allegations involve minors, which is a significant moral issue. Also, mention the legal age in Alabama and that statutes of limitations have passed. 

I should structure the summary to first state Moore's decision to sue, then the allegations, his denial, the impact on his campaign, and the context of the legal age and statutes. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and neutral but includes the moral elements. I'll start with the key points and ensure each sentence adds necessary information without being redundant.

SUMMARY: Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has vowed to sue The Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the claims "false and untrue," accusing the newspaper of attacking his character to derail his campaign. The Post's report, based on interviews with over 30 people, includes allegations of Moore engaging in sexual contact with a 14-year-old and pursuing relationships with three other women when they were between 16 and 18. Moore denied the allegations, calling them "fake news" and emphasizing his "highest regard for the protection of young children." He also claimed that the alleged incidents occurred nearly 40 years ago and that no one has accused him of sexual harassment or assault. Moore added that he is investigating the motivations behind the report and promised future "revelations." Several Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the allegations. Alabama's legal age of consent is 16, and the statutes of limitations for the alleged incidents have expired. END OF SUMMARY.
