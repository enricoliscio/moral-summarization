Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, suing The Washington Post over their report about his past behavior. Moore claims the allegations are false and that the Post is trying to stop his campaign. The Post hasn't commented yet. 

I remember that other public figures, like Trump and Weinstein, have threatened lawsuits but didn't follow through. The article mentions that the Post's report is based on over 30 interviews. The key points are that Moore is accused of pursuing relationships with minors when he was in his 30s, including a 14-year-old. The legal age in Alabama is 16, so some of these actions could have been illegal at the time, but the statute of limitations has passed. 

Moore denies everything, calls it fake news, and says he's been falsely accused. Some Republicans have withdrawn their support because of this. I need to include all these points in the summary without exceeding 200 words. 

I should structure it to first mention Moore's threat to sue, the nature of the allegations, the response from the Post, historical context of similar threats, details of the allegations, Moore's denial, and the political fallout. Keep it concise and make sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too wordy. Also, ensure that the summary ends with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue The Washington Post over a report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore called the claims "false and untrue," accusing the Post of attacking his character to derail his campaign. The Post, which based its report on interviews with over 30 people, declined to comment. While Moore denies the allegations, he has faced criticism and withdrawal of endorsements from some Republicans. The allegations include claims of sexual misconduct with minors, though no criminal charges were filed due to statutes of limitations. Moore has repeatedly denied the claims, calling them "fake news" and emphasizing his "highest regard for the protection of young children." He also hinted at ongoing investigations into the motivations behind the Post's reporting. END OF SUMMARY.
