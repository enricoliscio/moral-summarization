SUMMARY:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has threatened to sue The Washington Post over its report alleging he pursued sexual relationships with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s. Moore denies the allegations, calling them "completely false" and "fake news." The Washington Post report, based on interviews with over 30 people, alleges that Moore had sexual contact with a 14-year-old and pursued three other women when they were between 16 and 18 years old. Moore has denied the allegations, saying they are an attack on his character and reputation to stop his political campaign. This is not the first time a public figure has threatened legal action against a news organization, with President Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein making similar threats in the past. Several Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the report.
