Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI. He's described as a "proactive cooperator," which suggests he might have worn a wire for Mueller's investigation. The key points are his cooperation, the plea deal, lying to the FBI, the investigation into Russian interference, and the potential wiretapping.

I need to make sure to include the moral words: lying, investigating, interference, undermine, activity, arrested, investigation, collusion, claimed, downplayed, laundering, conspiracy. I should structure the summary to cover Papadopoulos's role, his cooperation, the implications, and the White House's response.

I'll start by mentioning his role and the plea deal, then his cooperation, the arrest, the lying, the investigation into collusion, the White House's downplay, and the speculation about wiretapping. I'll end with the potential impact on the investigation.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key points are covered with the moral terms included. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been labeled a "proactive cooperator" by federal investigators, suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian nationals, claiming he knew them before joining the campaign, but evidence showed he was lying. His cooperation is seen as critical to the ongoing investigation, with speculation that he may have recorded conversations with Trump associates. The White House downplayed his role, stating he played a minor part and that there was no collusion with Russia. Papadopoulosâ€™ arrest and plea deal were kept secret until recently, coinciding with an indictment against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates for money laundering and conspiracy. Legal experts suggest his cooperation could significantly impact the investigation, potentially revealing new evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
