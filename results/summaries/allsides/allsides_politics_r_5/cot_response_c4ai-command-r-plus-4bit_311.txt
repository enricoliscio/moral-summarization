SUMMARY:
A former Trump campaign advisor, George Papadopoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and is now a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, according to court documents. The term suggests Papadopoulos may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos was arrested in July for lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian nationals, including discussions of arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. The revelation of Papadopoulos' cooperation has sparked speculation about the extent of his assistance to the Mueller investigation, with experts suggesting he may have worn a wire to record conversations with Trump associates. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, denying any collusion with Russia. The unsealed indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy, provides no evidence of collusion. However, Papadopoulos' secret plea deal and cooperation with investigators suggest that the Mueller probe may have entered a new phase, potentially uncovering new subjects, targets, and possibilities in the ongoing investigation.
