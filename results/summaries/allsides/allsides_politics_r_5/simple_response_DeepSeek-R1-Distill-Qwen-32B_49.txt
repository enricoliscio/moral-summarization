Alright, I need to summarize this news article about George Papadopoulos and his role as a "proactive cooperator" for the Mueller investigation. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It mentions that Papadopoulos accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. He's described as a "proactive cooperator," which implies he might have worn a wire to gather information. The court documents indicate that his cooperation is crucial, so the filings were sealed to protect his role. 

I should highlight the speculation about him wearing a wire and the implications for the investigation. Also, note that the White House downplayed his involvement and that there's no evidence of collusion in the Manafort indictment. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll structure the summary by introducing Papadopoulos, his plea deal, his cooperation status, the speculation on wiretapping, the White House's response, and the potential impact of his role. I'll make sure to keep the moral framing intact, emphasizing the potential significance of his actions in the investigation.

George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been described as a "proactive cooperator" in the Mueller investigation, suggesting he may have worn a wire to gather information.

His cooperation could involve secretly recording conversations with Trump associates, as legal analysts speculate. The White House has downplayed his involvement, stating no collusion occurred. The revelation raises questions about the extent of Papadopoulos' assistance and its implications for the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
