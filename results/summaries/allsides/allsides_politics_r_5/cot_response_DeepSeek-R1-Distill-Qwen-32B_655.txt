Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about George Papadopoulos and his cooperation with Mueller's investigation. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "lied," "collusion," "proactive cooperator," "wire," "secret," "conspiracy," "cover-up," and "betrayal" stand out as they imply deceit, cooperation under surveillance, and potential wrongdoing.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. I'll make sure to include these moral terms to maintain the original framing. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: Papadopoulos's plea deal, his role as a proactive cooperator, the speculation about wearing a wire, the White House's response, and the implications for the investigation.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Papadopoulos's arrest and plea deal, then his cooperation, the speculation, the White House's downplay, and the potential impact of his actions on the investigation. I'll ensure that each morally framed word is included where appropriate to reflect the author's perspective.

Finally, I'll double-check that the summary meets the word limit and accurately represents the article's content while preserving the moral elements.

### SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, accepted a plea deal after lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Court documents revealed that Papadopoulos is a "proactive cooperator," suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference. Prosecutors requested court filings be sealed to protect his role. Papadopoulos was arrested in July for lying about his interactions with Russian nationals, including discussing meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The White House dismissed his role, claiming no collusion occurred. Papadopoulos's cooperation, including potential wiretapping, has sparked speculation about Mueller's investigation. Legal experts suggest his recordings could implicate others. END OF SUMMARY.
