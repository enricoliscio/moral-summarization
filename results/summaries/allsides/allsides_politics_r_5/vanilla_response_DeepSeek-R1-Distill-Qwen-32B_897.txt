Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI. He's now a "proactive cooperator" with Mueller's team. 

Hmm, the key points are that he might be wearing a wire to help investigations. The court documents mention sealing filings because his cooperation could be undermined if disclosed early. Prosecutors want to keep it secret to protect his role. 

Also, Papadopoulos lied about his contacts with Russians, and his emails and social media showed he was lying. He discussed arranging meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, and one contact mentioned hacked emails of Hillary Clinton. 

The White House downplayed his role. His plea deal was kept secret until recently, after Mueller indicted Manafort and Gates. The speculation is that Papadopoulos might have been recording conversations, which could be a big deal for the investigation.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention Papadopoulos's role as a cooperator, the plea deal, his lies, the speculation about wearing a wire, and the implications. Make sure to include that Mueller's team might have used him to gather info, and the White House's response.

Let me structure it: start with Papadopoulos's status, his cooperation, the plea deal details, his lies, the speculation on wiretapping, and conclude with the potential impact on the investigation and the White House's dismissal.

SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has become a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, according to court documents. This suggests he may have worn a wire or engaged in undercover work for Robert Mueller's team, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian nationals, including discussions about arranging meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. His cooperation was kept secret to avoid undermining his role. Prosecutors noted his efforts to assist the government, contingent on continued collaboration. Papadopoulos's arrest and plea deal were disclosed just before Mueller's office indicted Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, though no collusion evidence was provided. Speculation surrounds whether Papadopoulos recorded conversations with Trump associates, potentially expanding Mueller's investigation. The White House dismissed Papadopoulos's role as minor.  
END OF SUMMARY.
