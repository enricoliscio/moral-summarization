The article is about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.

The White House downplays his involvement, and there's no evidence of collusion in the Manafort indictment. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main facts and the speculation about his role as a cooperator.
