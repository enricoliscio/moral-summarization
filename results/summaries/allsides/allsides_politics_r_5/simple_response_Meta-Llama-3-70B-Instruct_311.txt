SUMMARY:

In a significant development in the Russia investigation, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, suggesting that he may have worn a wire to help prosecutors gather evidence. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, has been cooperating with the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller since his arrest in July. Court documents indicate that Papadopoulos' cooperation has been ongoing, with prosecutors noting that his arrest should remain sealed to prevent "premature disclosure" that could undermine his ability to assist in the investigation. Legal experts believe that Papadopoulos may have recorded conversations with Trump associates, potentially opening up new avenues of investigation. The revelation has sparked widespread speculation about the extent of Papadopoulos' cooperation and its implications for the Trump campaign.
