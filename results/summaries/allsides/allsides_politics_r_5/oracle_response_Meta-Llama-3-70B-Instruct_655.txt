SUMMARY: 
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and has been cooperating with the government since his arrest on July 27. His cooperation includes meeting with and providing information to the government on request. The revelation has raised questions about the extent of his cooperation, with some experts suggesting that he may have worn a wire to record conversations with Trump associates. This could be a significant development in the investigation, potentially uncovering new evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. The White House has downplayed the revelations, but the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy, suggests that the investigation is ongoing.
