SUMMARY:

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been cooperating with federal investigators, according to court documents. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is referred to as a "proactive cooperator", sparking speculation that he may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Prosecutors have asked a federal judge to seal court filings in the case, citing that "premature disclosure" of his arrest would undermine his ability to cooperate. Papadopoulos' cooperation may have involved wearing a wire and recording conversations with Trump associates, potentially leading to new leads in the investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
