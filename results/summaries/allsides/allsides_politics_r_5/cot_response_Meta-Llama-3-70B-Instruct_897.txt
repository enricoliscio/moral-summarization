SUMMARY:
A former Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and acknowledged his dishonesty as part of his plea deal. The White House downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part in the campaign and that there was no collusion with the Russian government. However, the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy, suggests otherwise. The possibility that Papadopoulos wore a wire to record conversations with Trump associates has opened up a new chapter of possibilities in the investigation, potentially a very big deal.
