SUMMARY:
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and has since acknowledged his dishonest actions. As part of his plea deal, he has been cooperating with the government, providing information and meeting with investigators on request. The White House has downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part in the campaign and that there was no collusion with the Russian government. However, legal analysts believe that Papadopoulos' cooperation may have led to recordings of conversations with Trump associates, potentially uncovering new evidence of wrongdoing. This development has significant implications for the investigation, and could be a "very, very big deal."
END OF SUMMARY.
