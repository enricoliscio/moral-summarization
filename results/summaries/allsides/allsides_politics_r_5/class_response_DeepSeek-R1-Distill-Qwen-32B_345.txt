Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. I'll start by reading the article to understand the key points. 

The article is about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI. He's described as a "proactive cooperator," suggesting he might have worn a wire for Mueller's investigation. The court documents mention sealing filings to prevent premature disclosure, which could undermine his cooperation. 

I should include words like lying, disclosure, undermine, cooperate, wearing (wire), collusion, conspiracy, etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight Papadopoulos's role, his cooperation, and the implications for the investigation. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. 

Also, I should make sure the summary flows naturally and maintains the moral implications as presented in the article. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts while emphasizing the ethical terms.

SUMMARY: Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is described as a "proactive cooperator" in court documents. This suggests he may have worn a wire to assist federal investigators, including Robert Mueller's team, in their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors requested court filings be sealed to prevent premature disclosure, which could undermine his ability to cooperate. Papadopoulos, arrested in July for lying about his interactions with Russian nationals, has been providing information to the government. His cooperation could involve engaging in undercover work, such as recording conversations with potential subjects. Legal analysts speculate that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, potentially capturing conversations with Trump associates. The White House downplayed his role, denying collusion with Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
