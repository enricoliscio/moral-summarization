SUMMARY:

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. This term suggests that Papadopoulos has worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos' cooperation may have involved engaging in undercover work, such as wearing a wire and meeting with persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity. He lied to FBI agents about his interactions with three Russian nationals, including discussing arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. The White House downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government. However, Papadopoulos' cooperation may have led to significant disclosures, potentially undermining the Trump campaign's claims of innocence. His efforts to cooperate with the Government may have involved secretly recording conversations with Trump associates, which could be a very big deal in the investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
