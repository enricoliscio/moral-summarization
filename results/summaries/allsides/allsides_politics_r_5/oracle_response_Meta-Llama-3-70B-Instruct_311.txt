SUMMARY: 

George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and acknowledged that he lied about his interactions with three Russian nationals. He initially claimed to have known the Russians prior to joining the Trump campaign, but investigators obtained emails and social media exchanges that showed he was lying. Papadopoulos discussed arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign, and one of his contacts told him that the Russian government had obtained "thousands" of Hillary Clinton's emails. The White House downplayed the revelations, saying that Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government. However, legal analysts believe that Papadopoulos' cooperation may have led to recordings of conversations with Trump associates, potentially uncovering evidence of money laundering and conspiracy.
