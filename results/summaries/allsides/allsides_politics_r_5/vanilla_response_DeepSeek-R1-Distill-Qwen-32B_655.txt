Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George Papadopoulos and his role as a proactive cooperator in the Mueller investigation. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Papadopoulos accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. The term "proactive cooperator" is highlighted, suggesting he might have worn a wire. The court documents were released on Monday, and prosecutors wanted to keep filings sealed to protect his role. Hot Air looked into this term, referencing a 2001 case where it meant undercover work, like wearing a wire or meeting suspects.

At his plea hearing, prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky said Papadopoulos would cooperate by meeting and providing info on request. Papadopoulos was arrested in July for lying during an FBI interview in January about his interactions with three Russians. His emails and social media showed he lied about knowing them before joining the Trump campaign. He discussed arranging meetings between Russian officials and the campaign, and one contact mentioned the Russians had Hillary Clinton's emails.

The White House downplayed his role, saying he was minor and there was no collusion. His plea deal and arrest were secret until Monday, right after Mueller indicted Manafort and Gates, who are charged with money laundering, not collusion.

Experts like Ron Hosko and Jeffrey Toobin speculate that Papadopoulos might have worn a wire, recording conversations with Trump associates. This could mean Mueller has new evidence from these recordings, which is a big deal in the investigation.

So, the key points are: Papadopoulos's plea deal, his role as a proactive cooperator possibly wearing a wire, the implications for Mueller's investigation, and the White House's response. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include these elements without getting too detailed.
