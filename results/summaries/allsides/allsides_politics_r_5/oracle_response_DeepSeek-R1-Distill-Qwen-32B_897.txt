Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and the list of morally framed words. I need to make sure I include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long, just under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who lied to the FBI. He's now a proactive cooperator, which might mean he's wearing a wire for Mueller's investigation. The article mentions the sealed court filings, his plea deal, and the speculation about his role.

I should start by identifying the key events: Papadopoulos's arrest, his plea deal, his cooperation, the sealed filings, and the speculation about wiretapping. I need to use words like lying, investigating, interference, undermine, arrested, lied, collusion, claimed, downplayed, conspiracy, money laundering.

I'll structure the summary to mention each point concisely. Make sure to include that he lied about contacts with Russians, was arrested, and now is a cooperator. The sealed filings indicate his role is important. The White House downplayed his role, but Mueller's team might be using him to gather info.

I should also mention the speculation about wiretapping and how that could be a big part of the investigation. Keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all the key moral terms.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary moral framing words without being redundant. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has become a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, according to court documents. This designation suggests he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos was arrested in July for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian nationals during the campaign. His plea deal acknowledges his false claims about his interactions with Russians, including discussions about arranging meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The White House has downplayed his role, but legal experts speculate that Papadopoulos may have been recording conversations with Trump associates as part of his cooperation. This raises questions about the extent of his involvement in Mueller's investigation and whether it could lead to further evidence of collusion or conspiracy. END OF SUMMARY.
