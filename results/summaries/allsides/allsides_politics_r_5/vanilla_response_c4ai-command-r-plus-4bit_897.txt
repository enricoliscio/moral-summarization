SUMMARY: Court documents revealed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. This term suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and assisted in the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Prosecutors requested that court filings related to Papadopoulos' arrest be sealed to protect his ability to cooperate proactively. The revelation sparked speculation about the extent of Papadopoulos' cooperation and the possibility of recordings of conversations with Trump associates. Legal analysts interpreted the term "proactive cooperator" as indicating that Papadopoulos likely wore a wire and engaged in undercover work for the government. Papadopoulos' plea deal and arrest were kept secret until hours after Mueller's office unsealed an indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates on charges unrelated to collusion with Russia. The White House downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign and denied any collusion.
END OF SUMMARY.
