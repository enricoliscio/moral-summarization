Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. My first step is to understand the article thoroughly. It's about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who lied to the FBI and is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation. The key points are his plea deal, his role as a proactive cooperator, and the speculation about him wearing a wire.

I need to make sure I include all the morally charged words: lying, disclosure, undermine, engage, wearing, involvement, activity, efforts, cooperate, lied, collusion, laundering, conspiracy. I should structure the summary to highlight Papadopoulos's cooperation, his lying, and the implications for the investigation. I also need to mention Mueller's office and the speculation about him wearing a wire, which ties into the moral aspects like lying and collusion.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll start by introducing Papadopoulos and his plea deal, then move on to his cooperation, the court documents, and the implications. I'll make sure to use the moral words naturally within the summary without forcing them. Also, I should note the White House's response to downplay the situation, which adds context to the political implications.

I need to avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and factual, focusing on the moral elements as per the author's framing. I'll check each sentence to ensure it includes the necessary terms and that the summary is within the word limit. Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed.

SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, accepted a plea deal after lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Court documents reveal he is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's team. Prosecutors requested court filings be sealed to prevent premature disclosure, which could undermine his ability to cooperate. Papadopoulos lied about his interactions with Russian nationals during an FBI interview, claiming prior knowledge of them before joining the campaign, but evidence from his emails and social media proved otherwise. He discussed arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign, and one contact mentioned Russia had obtained Hillary Clinton’s emails. The White House downplayed his role, denying collusion. Papadopoulos’ cooperation, including potential wiretapping, has sparked speculation about his involvement in gathering evidence against other subjects. His efforts to cooperate with the government are contingent on continued assistance. Mueller’s office unsealed an indictment against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, though no collusion evidence was provided. Legal analysts suggest Papadopoulos may have been wearing a wire, adding a new dimension to the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
