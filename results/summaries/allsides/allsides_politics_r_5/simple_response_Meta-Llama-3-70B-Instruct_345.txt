SUMMARY:

In a significant development in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. This means that Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, has likely worn a wire to help prosecutors gather evidence against other suspects. The revelation has sparked widespread speculation about the extent of Papadopoulos' cooperation, with some experts suggesting that he may have recorded conversations with Trump associates. The news comes as a significant blow to the Trump administration, which has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, but the fact that he was able to arrange meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign raises serious questions about the campaign's ties to Russia.
