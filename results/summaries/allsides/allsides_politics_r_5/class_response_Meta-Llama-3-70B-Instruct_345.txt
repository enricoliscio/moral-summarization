SUMMARY:

George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and has since acknowledged his deception. As part of his plea deal, he has been cooperating with the government, providing information and meeting with investigators on request. His efforts to cooperate may have included engaging in undercover work, such as wearing a wire and meeting with persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity, including collusion and money laundering. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role, but the revelation has raised questions about the extent of his cooperation and the potential implications for the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
