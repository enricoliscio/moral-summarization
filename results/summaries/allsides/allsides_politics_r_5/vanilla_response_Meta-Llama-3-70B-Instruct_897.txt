SUMMARY:

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Court documents show that Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, has been cooperating with investigators since his arrest in July. Prosecutors have asked a federal judge to seal court filings in the case, citing that "premature disclosure" of his arrest would undermine his ability to serve as a cooperator. Experts believe that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire to record conversations with Trump associates, potentially uncovering new evidence in the investigation.
