Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about George Papadopoulos and his role in the Mueller investigation. They also listed specific morally framed words that need to be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who lied to the FBI. He's now a "proactive cooperator," which might mean he's wearing a wire. The article mentions court documents, Mueller's investigation, and the implications of Papadopoulos's cooperation.

Next, I need to identify the key morally charged words: lying, investigating, interference, undermine, activity, arrested, investigation, collusion, claimed, downplayed, laundering, conspiracy. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Papadopoulos's arrest, his plea deal, his cooperation, the speculation about wearing a wire, the White House's response, and the implications for the investigation.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to include each key point, using the morally framed words where appropriate. For example, mentioning that Papadopoulos was arrested for lying, the investigation into Russian interference, and the White House downplaying his role.

I should also highlight the speculation about him wearing a wire, as that's a significant moral implication. Including terms like "collusion" and "conspiracy" will maintain the framing.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting from his arrest, through his cooperation, the implications, and the White House's reaction. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, preserving the moral context as required.

SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been identified as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's team in their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, was arrested in July for misleading agents during an interview. His cooperation was revealed in court documents, which prosecutors sought to keep sealed to avoid undermining his ability to assist the investigation. Papadopoulos claimed he knew the Russians before joining the campaign, but evidence showed he lied about his interactions, including discussions about arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. The White House downplayed his role, stating the campaign did not collude with Russia. Legal analysts speculate that Papadopoulos may have been wearing a wire, potentially recording conversations with Trump associates, which could significantly impact the ongoing investigation into collusion and conspiracy. END OF SUMMARY.
