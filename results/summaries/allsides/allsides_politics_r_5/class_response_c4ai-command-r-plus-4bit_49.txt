SUMMARY: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has accepted a plea deal and is now proactively cooperating with federal investigators in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Court documents unveiled on Monday revealed that Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign. The term "proactive cooperator" suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and recorded conversations with individuals suspected of criminal involvement. Prosecutors are seeking to seal court filings related to Papadopoulos' arrest to protect his ability to cooperate effectively. Papadopoulos' plea deal and arrest were kept secret until hours after Mueller's office unsealed an indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy. The White House downplayed Papadopoulos' role, denying any collusion with the Russian government. Legal analysts speculate that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, recording conversations with Trump associates, which could be a significant development in the investigation. The revelation of Papadopoulos' proactive cooperation underscores his efforts to cooperate with authorities and expose potential wrongdoing.

END OF SUMMARY.
