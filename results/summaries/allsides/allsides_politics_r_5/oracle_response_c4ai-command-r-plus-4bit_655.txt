SUMMARY: Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is reportedly a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, according to recently unsealed court documents. This term suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and actively assisted in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied about his interactions with Russian nationals, claiming he knew them before joining the Trump campaign. Investigators obtained evidence to the contrary, revealing that Papadopoulos discussed arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign and was informed about Russia's possession of Hillary Clinton's emails. The revelation of Papadopoulos' proactive cooperation has sparked speculation about the extent of his assistance to the investigation and the possibility of recorded conversations with Trump associates. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role and denied any collusion with the Russian government. The unsealing of Papadopoulos' case occurred around the same time as the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy. These developments underscore the ongoing investigation's seriousness and potential for further revelations.
END OF SUMMARY.
