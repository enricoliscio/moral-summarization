SUMMARY:

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Court documents show that Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and has been cooperating with the government since his arrest in July. Prosecutors have asked a federal judge to seal court filings in the case, citing that "premature disclosure" of his arrest would "significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperator." Experts believe that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and recorded conversations with Trump associates, potentially leading to new leads in the investigation. The White House has downplayed the revelations, saying that Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government.

END OF SUMMARY.
