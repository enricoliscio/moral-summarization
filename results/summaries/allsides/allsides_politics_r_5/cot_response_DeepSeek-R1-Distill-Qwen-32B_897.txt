Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that carry moral implications in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who lied to the FBI and is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation. The key morally framed words here are things like "lied," "collusion," "proactive cooperator," "undercover work," "wire," "secrets," "downplayed," "secret," "indictment," "money laundering," "conspiracy," "evidence," "secrets," "collusion," "speculation," "potential," "big deal," "explanation," "secrets," "collusion," "speculation," "potential," "big deal," "explanation," "secrets," "collusion," "speculation," "potential," "big deal," "explanation."

Now, for the summary, I need to weave these words in a way that captures the essence of the article without exceeding the word limit. I should highlight Papadopoulos's cooperation, his lying, the potential wiretapping, and the implications for the investigation. I also need to mention the White House's response and the speculation about the impact on the case.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Papadopoulos, his plea deal, and cooperation. Then, explain how his role as a proactive cooperator led to speculation about wiretapping. Mention the White House's downplay and the ongoing investigation. Finally, touch on the potential significance of his cooperation.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key points without getting bogged down in too many details. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is appropriately included.

**SUMMARY:**  

George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and is now a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. This designation suggests he may have worn a wire or engaged in undercover work to assist Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos's cooperation was revealed in court filings, which prosecutors sought to keep secret to protect his role. His plea deal acknowledged his lies about interactions with Russian nationals, including discussions about arranging meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The White House downplayed his involvement, stating the campaign did not collude with Russia. Legal experts speculate that Papadopoulos may have recorded conversations with Trump associates, potentially providing significant evidence for Mueller's probe. This development has sparked widespread speculation about its implications for the investigation.
