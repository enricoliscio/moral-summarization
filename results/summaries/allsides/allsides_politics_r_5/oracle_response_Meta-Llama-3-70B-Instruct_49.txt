SUMMARY:

A former Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, according to court documents. This means he has likely worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians, and his arrest and plea deal were kept secret until recently. He acknowledged lying about his interactions with three Russian nationals, including discussions about arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. The White House downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government. However, Papadopoulos' cooperation has sparked speculation about how much he has helped the Mueller team, with some experts suggesting he may have recorded conversations with Trump associates, potentially uncovering evidence of money laundering and conspiracy.
