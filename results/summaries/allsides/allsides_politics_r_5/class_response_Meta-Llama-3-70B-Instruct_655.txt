SUMMARY:

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts, is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. This term suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos' cooperation could significantly undermine his ability to serve as a cooperator if disclosed prematurely. Prosecutors noted that Papadopoulos will continue to meet with and provide information to the government on request, as part of his plea deal. Papadopoulos initially lied to agents about his interactions with Russian nationals, including discussions about arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. The White House downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part in the campaign and that there was no collusion with the Russian government. However, the revelation of Papadopoulos' cooperation has sparked speculation about how much he has helped the Mueller team, with some experts suggesting he may have worn a wire to record conversations with Trump associates.
