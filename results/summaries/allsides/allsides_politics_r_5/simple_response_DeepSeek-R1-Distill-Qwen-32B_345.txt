Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main focus is on George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who has become a proactive cooperator with Mueller's team. He accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.

I should highlight that the term "proactive cooperator" suggests he might have worn a wire, which is a significant detail. The article mentions court documents and legal analysts speculating about this. It's important to note that the White House downplayed his role, emphasizing that the Trump campaign didn't collude with Russia.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential elements: Papadopoulos's cooperation, the implications of being a proactive cooperator, the potential use of wiretaps, and the White House's response. I'll ensure the moral framing is preserved, showing the ethical implications of his cooperation and the ongoing investigation.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce Papadopoulos, then explain his cooperation, the speculation about wiretaps, and the White House's stance. I'll end with the potential impact of his role on the investigation. This should cover all necessary points concisely.
