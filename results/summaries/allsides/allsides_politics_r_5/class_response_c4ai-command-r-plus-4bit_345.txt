SUMMARY: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is reportedly a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, according to recently unsealed court documents. The term suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and actively engaged in undercover work to aid prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. The disclosure of Papadopoulos' status as a proactive cooperator has sparked speculation about the extent of his cooperation and the potential implications for the investigation. Papadopoulos was arrested in July for lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian nationals and his efforts to arrange meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In his plea deal, he admitted to lying about his knowledge of the Russians prior to joining the Trump campaign. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign and denied any collusion with the Russian government. However, Papadopoulos' cooperation with investigators and the possibility of recorded conversations with Trump associates could potentially be a significant development in the ongoing investigation. 

END OF SUMMARY.
