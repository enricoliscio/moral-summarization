Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI. He's described as a "proactive cooperator," which suggests he might have worn a wire for Mueller's investigation. The court documents mention that premature disclosure of his arrest would undermine his ability to cooperate. The author uses words like lying, disclosure, undermine, cooperate, collusion, etc.

I should start by identifying the main elements: Papadopoulos's plea deal, his role as a cooperator, the potential wiretapping, and the implications for the investigation. Also, the White House's response downplaying his role and the timing of the indictment against Manafort and Gates.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words without making the summary too long. Let me structure it: mention Papadopoulos's actions, his cooperation, the speculation about wiretapping, the court's reasoning, his lies about Russian contacts, and the White House's statement. Also, include the experts' opinions on the wiretapping possibility.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key moral terms are included. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point flows logically and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been described as a "proactive cooperator" in federal investigations, suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's team. Court documents indicate that premature disclosure of his arrest could undermine his ability to cooperate, as he has allegedly lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Papadopoulos admitted to lying about his interactions with Russian nationals during an FBI interview, including discussing potential meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. His cooperation efforts, including providing information to investigators, were highlighted in court filings. Legal experts speculate that Papadopoulos may have been wearing a wire to gather evidence, which could significantly impact the ongoing investigation into Russian interference. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role, stating he played a minor part in the campaign and denying collusion with Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
