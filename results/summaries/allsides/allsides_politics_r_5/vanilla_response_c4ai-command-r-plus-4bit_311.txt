SUMMARY: Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, according to court documents. This term suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and recorded conversations with individuals suspected of criminal activity. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and is now cooperating with the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign. The revelation has sparked speculation about the extent of Papadopoulos' cooperation and the possibility of recorded conversations with Trump associates. At his plea hearing, prosecutors stated that they would acknowledge Papadopoulos' efforts to cooperate as long as he continued to meet with and provide information to the government. The White House downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign and denied any collusion with Russia. Legal analysts suggest that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, recording conversations with subjects and targets of the investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
