Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. So, I need to ensure that the summary not only condenses the information but also maintains the ethical implications presented in the original text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The article discusses how he's a "proactive cooperator" for federal investigators, possibly wearing a wire to gather information. There's speculation about his role in helping Robert Mueller's investigation, and the implications of his cooperation on the case.

I should identify the main elements: Papadopoulos's role, the plea deal, his cooperation, the potential wiretapping, and the reactions from the White House and experts. The moral framing here involves the ethical considerations of using a cooperator to gather evidence, the potential impact on the investigation, and the White House's dismissal of collusion.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Papadopoulos's plea deal and his role as a proactive cooperator. Then, mention the speculation about wearing a wire and the implications. Include the White House's response and the experts' opinions on the significance of his cooperation.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the key information, then the speculation, followed by reactions. I'll make sure to highlight the ethical aspects, like the use of a cooperator and the potential for new evidence.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions but stick to the facts and the ethical implications as presented in the article.

SUMMARY: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has become a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and acknowledged arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Prosecutors have sealed court filings to protect his role as a cooperator, and legal experts speculate that he may have recorded conversations with Trump associates. Papadopoulos's cooperation has sparked widespread speculation about its impact on the investigation. The White House dismissed his role, stating he played a minor part in the campaign and that no collusion occurred. Mueller's office recently unsealed an indictment against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, but it did not provide evidence of collusion. END OF SUMMARY.
