Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI. The court documents refer to him as a "proactive cooperator," which suggests he might have been wearing a wire for Mueller's investigation. The user wants a summary that keeps the moral words like lying, investigating, interference, etc.

First, I'll identify the main points: Papadopoulos lied to the FBI, he's cooperating actively, which might involve undercover work, Mueller's investigation into Russian interference, his arrest, the plea deal, the emails showing he lied, the professor mentioning Clinton's emails, the White House downplaying his role, Manafort and Gates indicted, and experts speculating about him wearing a wire.

I need to make sure to include all the morally charged words. Let me structure the summary to cover each of these points concisely, using those words where appropriate. I'll start by introducing Papadopoulos and his plea deal, mention the term "proactive cooperator," then explain what that implies about his role. Then, touch on the investigation, his arrest, the details of his lies, the emails, the professor's info, the White House's response, the Manafort indictment, and the speculation about the wire.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary elements. Let me make sure each sentence flows logically and includes the moral framing words. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the article's content with the specified words.

SUMMARY:  
The former Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Court documents describe him as a "proactive cooperator," suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist federal investigators in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors requested court filings be sealed to protect his ability to cooperate. Papadopoulos was arrested in July for lying about his interactions with Russian nationals during an FBI interview. His plea deal acknowledged his false statements, including claims about arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. A contact mentioned the Russian government had obtained thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails. The White House downplayed Papadopoulos’ role, denying collusion with Russia. Mueller’s office recently unsealed an indictment against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, charging them with money laundering and conspiracy, though no evidence of collusion was provided. Legal experts speculate Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, potentially recording conversations with Trump associates, which could significantly impact the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
