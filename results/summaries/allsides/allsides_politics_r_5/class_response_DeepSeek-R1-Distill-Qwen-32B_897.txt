Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI. He's now a "proactive cooperator" helping Robert Mueller's team. The term "proactive cooperator" suggests he might have worn a wire to gather information. The article also mentions that his cooperation could involve undercover work, which is a strong moral framing word. 

I need to include words like lying, disclosure, undermine, engage, wearing, involvement, activity, efforts, cooperate, collusion, money laundering, and conspiracy. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence without losing the moral implications. 

I'll start by stating that Papadopoulos lied to the FBI and is now a proactive cooperator. Mention the speculation about wearing a wire and the potential impact on the investigation. Include the court documents, Mueller's office, and the White House's response. Also, note the charges against Manafort and Gates, which don't involve collusion but show the scope of the investigation. 

I should structure it so each sentence includes the key moral terms. Make sure to highlight the cooperation efforts and the possible wiretapping, which adds a layer of intrigue and potential for more evidence. 

Let me draft a few sentences, making sure to weave in those words naturally. Check the word count to stay within limits. Maybe start with his plea deal, mention lying, then his role as a cooperator, the speculation, and the implications. Conclude with the White House's stance and the ongoing investigation. 

I think that covers all the main points and includes the necessary moral terms. Now, I'll put it together concisely.

SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, accepted a plea deal after lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Court documents reveal he is a "proactive cooperator," suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference. Prosecutors requested court filings be sealed to prevent premature disclosure, which could undermine his ability to cooperate. Papadopoulos admitted to lying about his interactions with Russian nationals, including discussions about arranging meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. His cooperation efforts could involve undercover work, such as wearing a wire, to engage with individuals suspected of involvement in criminal activity. Legal analysts speculate that recordings of his conversations may have been used to target additional subjects. The White House downplayed his role, denying collusion, while Mueller's office continues to investigate without evidence of collusion. The case highlights the moral implications of lying, cooperation, and potential money laundering and conspiracy charges against others, such as Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. END OF SUMMARY.
