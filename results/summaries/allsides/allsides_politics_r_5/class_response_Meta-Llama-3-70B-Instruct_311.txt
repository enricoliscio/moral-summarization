SUMMARY:

George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and has been cooperating with the government since his arrest on July 27. As part of his plea deal, he acknowledged lying about his interactions with three Russian nationals and discussed arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. The White House has downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part in the campaign and that there was no collusion with the Russian government. However, experts believe Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, recording conversations with Trump associates, which could be a significant development in the investigation. The indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy, provides no evidence of collusion.
