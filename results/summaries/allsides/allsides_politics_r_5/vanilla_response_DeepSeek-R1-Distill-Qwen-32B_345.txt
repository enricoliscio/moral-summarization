Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser. He accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. The key point is that he's a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, which might mean he's wearing a wire for Robert Mueller's team. 

The court documents mention that his arrest was kept secret to protect his role as a cooperator. Prosecutors are trying to seal filings because early disclosure could harm his ability to help. The article references a legal definition where proactive cooperation involves undercover work, like wearing a wire. 

At his plea hearing, the prosecutor said Papadopoulos would continue to provide info as long as he cooperates. He was arrested in July for lying about his interactions with Russians. Emails and social media showed he lied about knowing Russians before joining the campaign. He discussed arranging meetings between Russians and Trump campaign, and one contact mentioned hacked emails of Hillary Clinton. 

The White House downplayed his role. His plea deal was secret until after Mueller indicted Manafort and Gates, who are charged with money laundering, not collusion. Experts suggest Papadopoulos might have worn a wire, which could be a big deal for the investigation. 

So, the summary needs to capture that Papadopoulos is cooperating actively, possibly using a wire, and this could have significant implications for the Mueller investigation. I'll make sure to include his role, the plea deal, the speculation about the wire, and the implications.

SUMMARY: Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is now a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, possibly wearing a wire for Robert Mueller's team. Court documents indicate his arrest was kept secret to protect his role. Papadopoulos lied about his interactions with Russian nationals, discussing potential meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, including a mention of hacked Hillary Clinton emails. His cooperation, which could involve undercover work, is significant as Mueller investigates Russian interference. The White House downplayed his role, and his plea deal was revealed after Mueller indicted Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, unrelated to collusion. Experts speculate Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, potentially providing critical evidence for the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
