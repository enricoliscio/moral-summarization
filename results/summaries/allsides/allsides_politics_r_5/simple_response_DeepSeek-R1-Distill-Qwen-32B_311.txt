Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about George Papadopoulos and his role as a "proactive cooperator" with the Mueller investigation. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about Papadopoulos, who was a Trump campaign adviser, accepting a plea deal for lying to the FBI. He's now cooperating with federal investigators, which might involve wearing a wire. The article mentions court documents referring to him as a "proactive cooperator," which suggests he's doing undercover work for Mueller's team. 

I need to make sure the summary captures the key details: his plea deal, the cooperation, the speculation about wearing a wire, the implications for the investigation, and the White House's response. Also, the moral framing is important, so I should highlight the ethical concerns about his role in the investigation, like potential surveillance of Trump associates.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with Papadopoulos's role and cooperation, mention the plea deal, the speculation on wiretapping, the implications for the Mueller investigation, and the White House's dismissal. End with the moral implications of his actions.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the necessary points without getting too detailed. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. 

After drafting, I'll check the word count and adjust if needed. Also, ensure that the moral framing is evident, such as the ethical issues of his cooperation and the potential impact on the investigation's integrity.

SUMMARY:  
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has become a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, suggesting he may have worn a wire to assist Robert Mueller's team in their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, agreed to cooperate under a plea deal. Court documents indicate his cooperation is critical to the investigation, and legal analysts speculate he may have recorded conversations with Trump associates. Mueller's office has kept Papadopoulos' role secret until now, just days after indicting Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The White House dismissed Papadopoulos' involvement as minor, denying collusion with Russia. His cooperation has sparked speculation about the extent of his role in the investigation, raising ethical questions about surveillance and the potential impact on the probe.  
END OF SUMMARY.
