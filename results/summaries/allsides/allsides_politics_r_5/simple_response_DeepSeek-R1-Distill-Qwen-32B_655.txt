Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about George Papadopoulos and his role as a "proactive cooperator" with Mueller's team. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Papadopoulos accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. He's described as a "proactive cooperator," which suggests he might have worn a wire to gather information. The court documents indicate that his cooperation is significant enough that the filings were sealed to protect his role.

I should note that Papadopoulos lied about his interactions with Russian nationals and was part of the Trump campaign. His cooperation is detailed in court filings, and there's speculation he was involved in undercover work. The White House downplays his role, but legal experts suggest he might have been wearing a wire.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral implications. The moral framing here is about Papadopoulos's cooperation possibly involving covert actions, which could impact the investigation's depth. I should highlight the speculation and its implications without assuming too much beyond the text.

I'll start by stating Papadopoulos's role and his plea deal, then move to the speculation about his cooperation, the court's actions to protect his role, and the implications for the investigation. I'll end with the White House's response and the experts' opinions to show the significance of his role.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within limits. I need to be clear and direct, avoiding unnecessary details but covering all main points. Also, preserving the moral framing means emphasizing the potential impact of his actions on the investigation's integrity and scope.

SUMMARY: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been described as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, suggesting he may have engaged in undercover work, such as wearing a wire, to assist Robert Mueller's team in their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian nationals and is cooperating with prosecutors. His cooperation was revealed in court filings that sought to keep his arrest details secret to protect his role. Legal experts speculate that Papadopoulos may have recorded conversations with Trump associates, which could significantly expand the scope of the investigation. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role, emphasizing that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
