SUMMARY:
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign advisor, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and is now a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. Court documents unveiled on Monday revealed that Papadopoulos accepted a plea deal and has been cooperating with the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian collusion in the presidential campaign. The term "proactive cooperator" suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire to help prosecutors build their case against other subjects and targets of the investigation. Speculation is mounting about the extent of Papadopoulos' cooperation and whether he recorded conversations with Trump associates. The revelation of Papadopoulos' plea deal and cooperation comes just hours after Mueller's office unsealed an indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy. The White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign and denied any collusion with the Russian government. However, Papadopoulos' emails and social media exchanges indicate that he discussed arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign and was aware of Russia's possession of Hillary Clinton's emails. The extent of Papadopoulos' undercover work remains a subject of speculation, with legal analysts suggesting that his cooperation could be a "very, very big deal."
