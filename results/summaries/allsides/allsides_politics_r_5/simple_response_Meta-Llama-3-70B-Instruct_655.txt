SUMMARY:

In a significant development in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. This term suggests that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, potentially recording conversations with Trump associates. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and has been cooperating with the government since his arrest in July. His cooperation has sparked speculation about the extent of his involvement in helping investigators, with some experts suggesting that he may have recorded conversations with other subjects and targets of the investigation. The White House has downplayed the revelations, but the development has significant implications for the ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
