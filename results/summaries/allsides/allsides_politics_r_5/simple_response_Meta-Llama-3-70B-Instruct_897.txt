SUMMARY:

The former Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, implying that he may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos' cooperation is significant, as he lied to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians, and his emails and social media exchanges showed that he was in contact with Russian nationals, discussing arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. The White House has downplayed the revelations, but legal analysts suggest that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, recording conversations with Trump associates, which could be a significant development in the investigation. This raises questions about the extent of Papadopoulos' cooperation and the potential implications for the Trump campaign.
