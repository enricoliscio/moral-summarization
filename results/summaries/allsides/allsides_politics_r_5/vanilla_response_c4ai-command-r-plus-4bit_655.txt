SUMMARY: Court documents unveiled Monday revealed that former Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators in the Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The term suggests Papadopoulos may have worn a wire to record conversations with individuals suspected of criminal activity. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the campaign. Prosecutors indicated that Papadopoulos had been providing information and meeting with investigators, and his cooperation would be noted at sentencing. The revelation sparked speculation about the extent of Papadopoulos' assistance to Mueller's team and the possibility of recorded conversations with Trump associates. Legal analysts interpreted the term "proactive cooperator" as an indication that Papadopoulos may have engaged in undercover work, potentially recording conversations with individuals involved in the Russia investigation. The White House downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign and denied any collusion with Russia.

END OF SUMMARY.
