SUMMARY:

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been cooperating with federal investigators, according to court documents. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is referred to as a "proactive cooperator", suggesting he may have worn a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Prosecutors have asked to seal court filings in the case, citing that "premature disclosure" of his arrest would undermine his ability to cooperate. Papadopoulos' cooperation may have involved meeting with and providing information to the government, and potentially wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump associates. Legal analysts speculate that Papadopoulos may have been recording conversations with subjects and targets of the investigation, potentially opening up new avenues of inquiry.

END OF SUMMARY.
