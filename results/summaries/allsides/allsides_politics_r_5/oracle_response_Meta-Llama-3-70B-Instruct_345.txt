SUMMARY:

George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and is cooperating with the government to uncover the truth. His arrest and plea deal were kept secret until Monday, when court documents were unsealed. The White House downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part in the campaign and that there was no collusion with the Russian government. However, Papadopoulos' cooperation has raised questions about how much he has helped the Mueller team, with some speculating that he wore a wire to record conversations with Trump associates. This development could be a significant breakthrough in the investigation, potentially uncovering evidence of money laundering and conspiracy.
