SUMMARY:
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, and his cooperation is seen as a significant development in the investigation. The White House downplayed the revelations, but legal experts believe that Papadopoulos' cooperation may have involved secretly recording conversations with Trump associates, potentially uncovering dishonest dealings. Papadopoulos' truthful cooperation could lead to a "whole new chapter of possibilities" in the investigation, and may even be a "very, very big deal". END OF SUMMARY.
