SUMMARY:
George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, and his cooperation efforts may have involved engaging in undercover work, such as wearing a wire and meeting with persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity. The White House downplayed the revelations, saying Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government. However, legal analysts suggest that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire, recording conversations secretly with Trump associates, which could be a "very, very big deal" in the investigation.
