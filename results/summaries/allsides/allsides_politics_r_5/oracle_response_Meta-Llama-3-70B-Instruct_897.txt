SUMMARY:

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has been revealed as a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators, sparking speculation that he wore a wire to help prosecutors in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians and was arrested on July 27. As part of his plea deal, he acknowledged lying about his interactions with three Russian nationals, including discussing arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. The White House downplayed the revelations, claiming Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government. However, Papadopoulos' cooperation has raised questions about how much he has helped the Mueller team, with some experts suggesting he may have worn a wire to record conversations with Trump associates, potentially uncovering evidence of money laundering and conspiracy.
