SUMMARY: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, has been revealed to be a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators in the Office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the presidential campaign. Court documents unveiled on Monday suggest that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and secretly recorded conversations with Trump associates. Papadopoulos accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, admitting that he lied about his interactions with three Russian nationals and discussed arranging meetings between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. He also knew that the Russian government had obtained Hillary Clinton's emails. Papadopoulos' cooperation with prosecutors was revealed just hours after Mueller's office unsealed an indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Rick Gates on charges of money laundering and conspiracy. While the White House has downplayed Papadopoulos' role and denied collusion with Russia, speculation is mounting about the extent of Papadopoulos' assistance to the Mueller investigation. Legal analysts suggest that Papadopoulos' recordings could be a "very big deal" and open a new chapter in the investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
