SUMMARY: A former Trump campaign advisor, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and is now a "proactive cooperator" in the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. Court documents revealed that Papadopoulos may have engaged in "undercover work" for the government, possibly wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump associates. This speculation was fueled by references to his "proactive cooperation" and the need to keep his arrest a "secret" to ensure his effectiveness as an informant. Papadopoulos admitted to lying about his interactions with Russian nationals, including discussions of arranging meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. He also learned of Russia's possession of Hillary Clinton's emails. Papadopoulos' plea deal and arrest were kept secret until the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy was unsealed. The White House downplayed Papadopoulos' role, denying any collusion with Russia. Legal analysts speculate that Papadopoulos' cooperation may have opened a new chapter in the investigation, potentially revealing further incriminating evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
