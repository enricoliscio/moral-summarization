Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about George Papadopoulos. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. It mentions that he's a "proactive cooperator," which probably means he's helping federal investigators, maybe even wearing a wire. The court documents were released on Monday, and that's when this information came out.

The article also notes that prosecutors wanted to keep their filings sealed because revealing Papadopoulos's arrest too early would hinder his cooperation. There's a reference to a 2001 court case explaining that proactive cooperation often involves undercover work, like wearing a wire or meeting with suspects. At his plea hearing, the prosecutor mentioned that his cooperation would be noted at sentencing if he continued to assist.

Papadopoulos was arrested in July for lying about his interactions with three Russians. His emails and social media showed he lied about knowing them before joining the Trump campaign. He discussed arranging meetings between Russians and the Trump team, and one contact mentioned the Russians had Clinton's emails.

The White House downplayed his role, saying he was minor and there was no collusion. His plea deal and arrest were secret until Monday, right after Mueller indicted Manafort and Gates, but that indictment didn't mention collusion.

Experts like Ron Hosko and Jeffrey Toobin speculate that Papadopoulos might have been wearing a wire, which could mean he recorded conversations with Trump associates, adding a new layer to the investigation.

So, the summary should cover: Papadopoulos's role as a proactive cooperator, his plea deal, lying to the FBI, his potential wire work, the court's secrecy, his discussions about meetings and Clinton's emails, the White House's response, and the speculation about his role in Mueller's investigation.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all key points without getting too detailed.
