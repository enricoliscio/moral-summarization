SUMMARY:
Court documents unveiled Monday revealed that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. The term suggests Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and secretly recorded conversations with people associated with the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos lied about his interactions with Russian nationals and discussed arranging meetings between Russian officials and the campaign. He also learned that the Russian government had obtained Hillary Clinton's emails. Papadopoulos' cooperation with prosecutors was revealed just hours after the unsealing of an indictment against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, on charges of money laundering and conspiracy. The indictment provides no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House downplayed Papadopoulos' role, stating he played a small part in the campaign. However, legal analysts speculate that Papadopoulos' secret recordings could be a significant development in the investigation.
