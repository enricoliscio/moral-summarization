SUMMARY: Court documents unveiled Monday revealed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who accepted a plea deal for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, is a "proactive cooperator" with federal investigators. This term has led to speculation that Papadopoulos may have worn a wire and secretly recorded conversations with individuals associated with the Trump campaign. According to the court filing, Papadopoulos' cooperation is crucial to the investigation and premature disclosure of his arrest could undermine his ability to serve as an effective cooperator. Prosecutors indicated that they would highlight Papadopoulos' efforts to cooperate with the government at his sentencing, provided he continued to meet with and provide information to them. This development suggests that Papadopoulos may have played a significant role in the ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
