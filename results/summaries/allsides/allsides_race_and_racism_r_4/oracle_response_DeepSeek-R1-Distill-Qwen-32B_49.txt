Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and a list of morally framed words used by the author. My task is to summarize the article while preserving as many of those moral words as possible.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about a police shooting in Fort Worth, Texas. A white officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The family's attorney called it murder, and there's a lot of moral framing around justice, protection, and the failure of the system.

Next, I should identify the key events and the moral language used. The officer didn't announce his presence before shooting, which is a moral failing because it's a basic protocol. The family is grieving and questioning why this happened. The police department is under scrutiny for transparency and their handling of the investigation.

I need to make sure the summary includes words like "killed," "murder," "justice," "protect," "transparency," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues without getting bogged down in too many details.

I'll start by stating the incident, then move to the family's reaction, the police's response, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to convey the gravity of the situation.

I should also keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll need to be selective about which points to include. The key points are the shooting, the officer's failure to announce, the family's loss, the call from the neighbor, the police's investigation, and the broader context of similar incidents.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral implications. This way, the summary not only informs but also reflects the author's moral stance on the issue.

SUMMARY: A white Fort Worth police officer killed 28-year-old black woman Atatiana Jefferson inside her home after responding to a neighbor’s call about an open front door. Attorney Lee Merritt, representing Jefferson’s family, called the shooting “murder,” stating the officer “didn’t have time to perceive a threat” before firing. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed. Police said officers saw someone near a window and fired after “perceiving a threat,” but the family questioned why Jefferson was killed. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, is on administrative leave. The family demanded a “thorough and expedient investigation,” while the police department released bodycam footage, though it remains unclear if Jefferson posed a threat. The incident has sparked calls for justice and an end to the killings of unarmed Black Americans. The officer did not announce his presence before firing, and the family expressed confusion and grief, with Jefferson’s sister stating, “You want to see justice, but justice don’t bring my sister back.” The shooting has reignited debates about police accountability and transparency. END OF SUMMARY.
