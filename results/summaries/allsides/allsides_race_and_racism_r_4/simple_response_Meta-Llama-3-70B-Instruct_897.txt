SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman, inside her own home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called it "murder" as the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat. The video shows the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing through a window. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the shooting. The family is demanding justice, but is confused and frustrated by the lack of explanation from the police department. The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end."
