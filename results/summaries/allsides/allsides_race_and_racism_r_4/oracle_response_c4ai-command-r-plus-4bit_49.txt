The shooting has also drawn attention from politicians, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation. This incident follows a similar case where a white police officer was convicted of murdering her black neighbor. The moral framing of the article centers around the concepts of justice, protection, and transparency in the face of a tragic loss.
