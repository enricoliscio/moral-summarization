Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about a police officer who shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home in Texas. The officer was responding to a call about an open front door. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, says the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat, calling it murder. The police department's statement says the officer perceived a threat. The video from the bodycam shows the officer firing a shot through the window after shouting "Put your hands up." The family is devastated, feeling that the police, who are supposed to protect, failed them. The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is ongoing. A neighbor who called the police feels guilty, saying if he hadn't called, she'd still be alive. The article also mentions a similar case where a former police officer was sentenced for murder.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words. Let me list the key points: police killed woman, officer fired without announcing, family calls it murder, justice, protect, loss, investigation, etc. I should structure the summary to include these words and convey the moral issues involved.

I should start by stating the incident, mention the officer's action, the family's reaction, the police's response, the investigation, the neighbor's guilt, and the context of similar cases. Make sure to include all the morally framed words as much as possible without making it too long.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely.
