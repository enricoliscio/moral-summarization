SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her Texas home, shooting her through a window.

The family is seeking justice and an expedient investigation, expressing confusion and heartbreak over the loss of Jefferson, who was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for transparency, with Senator Bernie Sanders requesting a Justice Department investigation. This incident follows another recent fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in Dallas, highlighting ongoing concerns about the killings of unarmed black Americans by law enforcement.
