SUMMARY: A white police officer shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her Texas home. The officer was responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door and fired through a window after perceiving a threat. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, viewed the bodycam footage and stated that the officer did not have time to perceive a threat and that his failure to announce himself as police is indicative of murder. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident and confirmed that Jefferson's nephew was in the room at the time of the shooting. The officer has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for justice, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation. The incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced for the fatal shooting of a black neighbor in his own apartment.
END OF SUMMARY.
