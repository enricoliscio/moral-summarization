SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot. The bodycam video shows the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing through a window. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the shooting. The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called the shooting "murder" and said the officer did not have time to perceive a threat before firing. The family is seeking justice and an explanation for the shooting. The incident has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation.
