Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the shooting of Atatiana Jefferson by a Fort Worth police officer. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, ending with specific tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main event is the police shooting, the family's reaction, the officer's actions, and the broader context of similar incidents.

I should include the following details:
- Officer's background: white, 2018 on the force, on administrative leave.
- Victim: 28-year-old black woman, watching her nephew when shot.
- The trigger: neighbor called about an open door.
- Officer's actions: didn't announce himself, perceived threat, fired through window.
- Family's perspective: confused, demanding justice, mention of another case (Amber Guyger).
- Media and legal response: attorney's comments, Sanders' call for investigation.
- Video details: gun visible, but unclear if it was hers.

I need to structure this in a clear, concise manner, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with the incident, then family reaction, officer's status, neighbor's role, and the broader implications.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within 200 words. I'll check for clarity and that all important aspects are included without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: A Fort Worth police officer shot and killed 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, is on administrative leave while an investigation is conducted. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the incident. The officer did not announce himself before firing, and the family claims there was no perceived threat. The police department stated that officers saw someone near a window and perceived a threat before firing. Bodycam footage shows the officer firing through a window after shouting, "Put your hands up." The family is demanding justice, calling the situation "inconceivable" and "confusing." The officer's attorney, Lee Merritt, labeled the shooting as murder. The family also mentioned finding a gun inside the residence, but it's unclear if Jefferson had it. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a Justice Department investigation. This incident follows a similar case in Dallas where a white officer was sentenced for killing a black man. END OF SUMMARY.
