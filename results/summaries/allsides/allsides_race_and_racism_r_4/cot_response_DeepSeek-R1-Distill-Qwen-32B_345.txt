Okay, so I need to help this user with their query. They want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given a specific structure: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then provide a concise summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about a police officer killing a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her home. The family is upset, claiming it's murder, while the police say the officer perceived a threat. There's a bodycam video showing the officer didn't announce himself before shooting. The family is seeking justice, and there's a mention of another similar case with a Dallas police officer.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "killed," "murder," "injustice," "unjust," "unarmed," "unprovoked," "concern," "transparency," "fault," "unjustified," "unfair," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust," "unjust,"
