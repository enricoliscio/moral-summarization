Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about a police officer who shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, is involved, and there's a lot of emotional language from the family members and the community. The police department's response is also a key part of the story.

For the first step, I need to identify the morally charged words. These are words that carry strong emotional or ethical connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "murder," "killed," "unarmed," "unjust," "injustices," "oppression," "inconceivable," "confusion," "fault," "transparency," "justice," "loss," " shaken," "upset," "unspeakable," "innocent," "vulnerable," "accountability," "racism," "injustices," "oppression," "inconceivable," "confusion," "fault," "transparency," "justice," "loss," " shaken," "upset," "unspeakable," "innocent," "vulnerable," "accountability," "racism."

Next, I'll write the summary. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary should capture the main points: the shooting, the family's reaction, the police's response, the lack of announcement before shooting, the presence of a child, the police's handling of the investigation, the community's reaction, and the call for justice.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the killing, the lack of announcement leading to murder, the confusion and loss felt by the family, the call for accountability, and the broader context of systemic issues. I'll make sure to mention the key players: the family, the attorney, the police, and the public reaction.

I should also include the fact that the police didn't announce themselves before shooting, which adds to the moral framing. The presence of a child in the room adds to the tragedy and the moral weight of the situation.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all the important points without being too verbose. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and concise, focusing on the ethical and emotional aspects highlighted in the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
A Fort Worth police officer killed Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman, inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open door. Attorney Lee Merritt argued the officer "didnâ€™t have time to perceive a threat" and called the shooting "murder." Jefferson's family expressed shock and confusion, emphasizing the loss of an innocent life. Police stated the officer perceived a threat but did not announce his identity before firing, raising questions about accountability and transparency. The family demanded a thorough investigation, highlighting systemic injustices and racial disparities in policing. The incident sparked outrage, with calls for justice and an end to the killing of unarmed Black Americans. The shooting occurred less than two weeks after a similar case in Dallas, further highlighting the need for change. END OF SUMMARY.
