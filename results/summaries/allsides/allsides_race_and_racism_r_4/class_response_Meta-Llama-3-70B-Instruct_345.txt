SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before killing a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since April 2018, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called the shooting "murder," saying the officer didn't shout "Gun, gun, gun" before firing. The police department released bodycam footage showing the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing a shot through a window, killing Jefferson. Her family is seeking "justice" and demanding to know why she was killed. The neighbor who called the police said he feels partly responsible for her death, saying "If I had never dialed the police department, she'd still be alive." The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end."
