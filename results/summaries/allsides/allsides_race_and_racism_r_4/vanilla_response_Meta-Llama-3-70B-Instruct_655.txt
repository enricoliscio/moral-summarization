SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and an attorney for Jefferson's family claims the officer did not have time to perceive a threat before opening fire. The police department released bodycam footage showing the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing through a window. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the shooting. The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The family is seeking justice and demanding answers as to why Jefferson was killed. The incident has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation.
