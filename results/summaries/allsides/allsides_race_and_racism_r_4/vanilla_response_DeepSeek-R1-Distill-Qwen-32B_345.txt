Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the police shooting in Fort Worth. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a white police officer who shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The incident happened after a neighbor called about an open front door. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, says the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat, calling it murder. The police department's statement mentions that the officer perceived a threat, but the video shows the officer didn't announce himself before shooting. The family is devastated, questioning why she was killed. The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is ongoing. The neighbor who called is feeling guilty, saying if he hadn't called, she'd still be alive. The police released bodycam footage, which shows a blurred image of a gun inside the home, but it's unclear if the officer saw it. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders is calling for a federal investigation. This case is similar to another recent case where a police officer killed a black man, Botham Jean.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key details: who was killed, the circumstances, the family's reaction, the police response, the investigation, and the broader context.

I'll start by stating the incident: a white officer killed a black woman in her home after a neighbor's call. Mention the family's attorney's claim of murder. Then the police's version about perceiving a threat. The video details: officer didn't announce himself, shot through the window. Family's confusion and grief. The officer is on leave, investigation pending. Neighbor's guilt. Blurred gun image in video. Sanders' call for investigation. Reference to the previous case for context.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, covering all main points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without exceeding the word limit.
