SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her Texas home. The officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and failed to announce he was police before he opened fire, according to an attorney for the woman's family and police statements. The family is demanding justice and an expedient investigation, expressing confusion and grief over the loss of their loved one. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for the Justice Department to investigate, with Senator Bernie Sanders stating, "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." The incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years for the murder of her black neighbor.

The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the shooting to provide transparency, but the family's attorney and others are calling for a thorough investigation into the killing, questioning the officer's actions and the perceived threat. The officer has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
