Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to make sure I capture all the key points.

The main event is a white police officer killing a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer acted on a neighbor's call about an open door. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, argues that the officer didn't perceive a threat, calling it murder. The police statement mentions perceiving a threat, but the video shows the officer didn't announce his presence before shooting. The family is devastated, feeling the system failed them. The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is underway. A gun was found in the residence, but it's unclear if the officer saw it. The article also connects this to another case where a former officer was sentenced for murder, adding context. Bernie Sanders calls for federal investigation.

I need to include words like killed, shooting, threat, murder, protect, justice, etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues: the officer's actions, lack of announcement, family's loss, and the broader context of police violence. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me start by stating the incident, then the family's perspective, the police response, the video details, the family's emotional state, the officer's status, and the broader implications. I'll make sure to use the specified moral terms where appropriate.
