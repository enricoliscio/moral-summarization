Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article is about a police officer who shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in Texas. The family's attorney says the officer didn't perceive a threat before shooting, calling it murder. The family is devastated, especially since she was watching her nephew at the time. The police department's statement says the officer perceived a threat, but the video shows the officer didn't announce himself before shooting. The neighbor who called the police feels guilty, saying if he hadn't called, she'd still be alive. The police released bodycam footage, which shows a gun inside the home, but it's unclear if the officer saw it. There's also mention of a similar case in Dallas where a white officer killed a black man, leading to a 10-year sentence. The family expects a thorough investigation, and Bernie Sanders is calling for federal involvement.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral elements. The key moral points are the use of excessive force without proper announcement, the family's grief, the neighbor's regret, and the call for justice. I should highlight the lack of perceived threat, the officer's actions, and the broader context of similar incidents. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral outrage and the systemic issues pointed out by the family and activists.

Let me structure this: start with the incident, mention the family's attorney's claim, the family's reaction, the police's version, the bodycam details, the neighbor's remorse, the call for investigation, and the broader context. Keep it concise but cover all these points without exceeding the word limit.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that the moral framing is evident, like the officer's failure to announce himself, the confusion in the family, and the call for justice. Maybe end with the broader implications, like systemic issues in policing.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence adds value and stays within the word count. I'll check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200.

Attorney Lee Merritt, representing Jefferson's family, argued that the officer did not perceive a threat before firing, calling it murder. The family expressed grief, noting Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. Police stated the officer perceived a threat but did not announce himself before shooting. Bodycam footage shows the officer firing through a window without identifying himself, and a gun was later found inside the home.

The family seeks a thorough investigation, while Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for federal involvement. The incident follows a similar case in Dallas where a white officer was sentenced for killing a Black man. The shooting highlights concerns about excessive force and accountability in policing. END OF SUMMARY.
