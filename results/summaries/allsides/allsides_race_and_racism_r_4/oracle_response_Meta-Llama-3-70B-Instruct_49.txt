SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before firing, according to the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, who called it "murder." The officer did not announce himself as police before shooting Jefferson, who was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. The family is seeking "justice" and demanding to know why Jefferson was killed, with her sister saying, "You want to see justice, but justice don't bring my sister back." The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation, and the police department has expressed "serious and heartfelt concern" for the "unspeakable loss." The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
