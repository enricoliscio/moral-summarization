SUMMARY: An innocent black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, was unjustifiedly killed by a white police officer in her own home in Texas. This tragic incident has left Jefferson's family outraged and demanding justice. The officer, who did not announce himself as police, perceived a threat and fired a shot through a window, killing Jefferson. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called the shooting "murder," stating that the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat and failed to shout about a gun. The killing has been described as unjust, senseless, and disturbing by various individuals, including Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who called on the Justice Department to investigate. This incident comes less than two weeks after a similar shooting in Dallas, where a white former police officer was convicted of murdering her black neighbor. Merritt also represents the victim's family in that case. Jefferson's family is grieving and struggling to understand why this tragedy occurred. They are calling for a thorough and expedient investigation into the unjustifiable use of force by police. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident but has not provided additional details or comments. The community is outraged and demanding answers for this senseless loss of life. END OF SUMMARY.
