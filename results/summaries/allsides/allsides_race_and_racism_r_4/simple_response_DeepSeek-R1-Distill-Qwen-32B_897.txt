Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the incident happened in Fort Worth, Texas. A white police officer shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer was responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, says the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat, calling it murder. The police department's statement says the officer perceived a threat before shooting. The video shows the officer firing after shouting, "Put your hands up," but didn't announce he was police first. The family is devastated, questioning why she was killed. The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is ongoing. The neighbor who called is feeling guilty, and there's a gun found in the home, but it's unclear if the officer thought she had it. Bernie Sanders is calling for a federal investigation. This case is similar to another where a police officer killed a black man, and she's now serving a 10-year sentence.

Now, I need to capture the moral aspects. The family's attorney and sister are emphasizing the lack of threat perception, suggesting it's murder. The family's confusion and grief are highlighted. The officer's failure to announce his presence is a key point. The neighbor's guilt shows the impact on the community. The mention of the previous case ties it into a pattern of police violence against black people. Bernie Sanders' call for justice adds a political angle.

I should structure the summary to include these elements: the incident, the moral claims from the family, the police's response, the neighbor's reaction, the investigation, and the broader context of similar cases. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me start drafting: Mention the shooting, the officer's action, the family's attorney's claim of murder, the police's perception of threat, the video details, the family's reaction, the neighbor's guilt, the investigation status, the gun's ambiguity, and the call for federal investigation, linking it to the previous case.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all critical points without being too detailed. Also, maintain a neutral tone but include the moral perspectives presented by the family and their supporters.

Double-checking to ensure I haven't missed any key points: The nephew was present, the officer's administrative leave, the police's partial transparency, and the comparison to the Dallas case. All these should be included succinctly.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: A Fort Worth police officer shot and killed black woman Atatiana Jefferson inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. Attorney Lee Merritt for Jefferson's family claimed the officer "didn’t have time to perceive a threat" and called the shooting "murder." Police stated the officer perceived a threat before firing, but video shows he did not announce he was police before shooting. Jefferson's family expressed grief and confusion, with her sister stating, "It’s another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us." The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is ongoing. A gun was found in the home, but it’s unclear if the officer believed Jefferson had it. Neighbor James Smith, who called police, expressed guilt, saying, "If I had never dialed the police department, she’d still be alive." Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a federal investigation, highlighting the pattern of police violence against Black Americans. This case follows a similar fatal shooting in Dallas, where a white officer was sentenced for killing a black man. END OF SUMMARY.
