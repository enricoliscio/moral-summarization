Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed, then write a summary using those words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about a police officer killing a black woman in Texas. The family's attorney is calling it murder, and there's a lot of emotion from the family members. The police say they perceived a threat, but the video shows the officer didn't announce himself before shooting. The neighbor who called the police feels guilty. There's also mention of another case where a police officer was sentenced for killing a black man, which adds to the moral context.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to list all the single words that carry moral weight. Words like "killed," "murder," "threat," "justice," "confusion," "fault," "unarmed," "end," "sentence," "murder," "apartment," "mistake," "trial," "conviction." These words are used to convey blame, guilt, or moral judgment.

Next, the summary needs to include as many of these words as possible while being concise. I should mention the key points: the officer's action, the family's reaction, the police's statement, the neighbor's guilt, the comparison to the previous case, and the call for justice. I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words.

I think I've got all the necessary elements. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate. I'll start by stating the incident, then the family's perspective, the police's explanation, the neighbor's feelings, the previous case, and the call for justice. That should cover all the moral points effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  

A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her Texas home after responding to a neighbor’s call about an open front door. The family’s attorney called the shooting "murder," stating the officer "didn’t have time to perceive a threat" before firing. Police claimed the officer acted after "perceiving a threat," but the family expressed confusion and anger, questioning why Jefferson was killed. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, is on administrative leave. The family emphasized the need for a "thorough and expedient investigation." A neighbor who called police expressed guilt, saying, "If I had never dialed the police department, she’d still be alive." The shooting follows a recent case where a white former police officer was sentenced for murdering a black man. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for justice, stating, "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." The family seeks answers and accountability for the tragedy.
