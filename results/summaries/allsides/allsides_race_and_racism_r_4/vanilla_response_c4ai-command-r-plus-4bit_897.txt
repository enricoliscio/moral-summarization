SUMMARY: A white police officer shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, inside her Texas home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has not been named, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. Lee Merritt, an attorney for Jefferson's family, stated that the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before opening fire and that the shooting was "murder." The bodycam footage released by police shows the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing a single shot through a window. The Fort Worth Police Department has acknowledged that the officer did not announce he was police before firing and that this failure is part of the investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for justice, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling on the Justice Department to investigate. The incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fatally shooting her black neighbor in his own apartment.
END OF SUMMARY.
