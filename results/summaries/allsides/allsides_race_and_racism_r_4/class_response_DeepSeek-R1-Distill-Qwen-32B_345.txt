Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about a police officer killing a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer responded to a call about an open door. The family's attorney calls it murder because the officer didn't perceive a threat before shooting. The family is devastated, and the officer is on administrative leave. The police released bodycam footage, which shows the officer didn't announce himself before firing. The neighbor who called the police feels responsible and upset. The article also mentions a previous case where a police officer was sentenced for murder. The moral words used are things like killed, shooting, threat, murder, protect, justice, etc. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary. I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the key moral points. I'll structure it to highlight the officer's actions, the family's reaction, the police response, and the broader context of similar incidents. I should avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the facts presented, using the morally charged words from the article.

Attorney Lee Merritt argued the officer didn't perceive a threat before firing, calling it murder. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed. Police stated officers saw someone near a window and fired after perceiving a threat. Bodycam footage showed the officer didn't announce he was police before shooting. The family expressed confusion and grief, questioning why Jefferson was killed. The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is underway. The neighbor who called police felt responsible and upset, stating he wouldn't call again. The police released blurred footage showing a gun inside the home, but it's unclear if the officer saw it.
