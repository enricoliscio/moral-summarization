Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the shooting of Atatiana Jefferson by a Fort Worth police officer. The user wants the summary to be concise, no more than 200 words, and it needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The key elements are: the incident happened in Fort Worth, Texas, involving a white police officer who killed a black woman inside her home. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, claims the officer didn't perceive a threat before shooting, calling it murder. The police say the officer perceived a threat but didn't announce he was police before shooting. The family is devastated, and an aunt and sister express their confusion and grief. The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is ongoing. A neighbor who called the police feels responsible. The police released some bodycam footage but not all due to state law. There's mention of a gun found in the home, but it's unclear if the officer saw it. Bernie Sanders called for a Justice Department investigation. This incident is similar to a previous case in Dallas where a police officer killed a black man.

Now, I need to condense this into a coherent summary. I should mention the shooting, the family's reaction, the police's stance, the investigation, the neighbor's role, the mention of the gun, and the call for justice. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key points.

I'll structure it as follows: Start with the incident, then the family's attorney's statement, the police's explanation, the family's confusion, the officer's status, the neighbor's feelings, the bodycam details, the gun's mention, Sanders' call, and the connection to the previous Dallas case. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and flows logically.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. I'll avoid any unnecessary details and focus on the main facts. Also, I'll ensure that the summary is objective, presenting both the family's and the police's perspectives.

Finally, I'll format it correctly with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: A Fort Worth police officer shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open door. Attorney Lee Merritt for Jefferson's family argued the officer didn't perceive a threat before firing, calling it murder. Police stated the officer perceived a threat but did not announce his identity before shooting. Jefferson's family expressed confusion and grief, with her sister and aunt questioning the circumstances. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, is on administrative leave while an investigation is conducted. A neighbor who called police expressed guilt, stating he wouldn't have called if he knew the outcome. Bodycam footage released by police shows officers approaching the home but does not clarify if Jefferson posed a threat. A gun was found in the home, but it's unclear if the officer saw it. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a federal investigation. The incident follows a similar case in Dallas where a police officer killed a Black man. END OF SUMMARY.
