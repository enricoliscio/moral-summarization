SUMMARY:
A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself before firing the fatal shot, which is part of the department's investigation. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called it "murder" because the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before opening fire. The family is seeking "justice" and a "thorough and expedient investigation." The neighbor who called the police is "shaken," "mad," and "upset," feeling partly responsible for Jefferson's death. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "the killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
