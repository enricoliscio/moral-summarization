SUMMARY: A white police officer killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, inside her Texas home while responding to a non-emergency call about an open front door. The officer did not announce he was police before he fired, and the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, argues that the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and that it was "murder." The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident but blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom, though it's unclear if the gun was found near Jefferson. The police statement released after the incident stated that officers found a firearm in the residence after the shooting. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Senator Bernie Sanders calling on the Justice Department to investigate. Amber Guyger, a white former Dallas police officer, was recently sentenced to 10 years in prison for the fatal shooting of a black man in his own apartment. Merritt represents the families of both victims, highlighting a pattern of unjustified police shootings of unarmed black individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
