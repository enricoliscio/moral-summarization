SUMMARY: A white police officer murdered a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her Texas home while responding to a call about an open front door. The officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and fired a shot through a window, killing Jefferson. Her family is demanding justice and an investigation, but the officer has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for justice, with Senator Bernie Sanders calling on the Justice Department to investigate. The killing comes less than two weeks after a white former police officer was sentenced to 10 years for murdering her black neighbor. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident, but the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called the shooting "murder." Merritt also represents the family of Botham Jean, who was killed by a white police officer in a similar incident. The police statement included blurred still frames of a gun inside a bedroom, but it is unclear if the firearm was found near Jefferson.
END OF SUMMARY.
