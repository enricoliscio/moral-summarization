SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her Texas home. An attorney for the woman's family, Lee Merritt, said the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and that the shooting was "murder." Jefferson's family is seeking "justice" and expects a thorough investigation. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident but has not provided any footage from inside the residence due to state law. The police statement said officers saw someone near a window and "perceived a threat," leading to the officer firing his weapon. The officer did not announce he was police before he fired, and an investigation is ongoing. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has called on the Justice Department to investigate, stating that the "killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." This incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years for the murder of her black neighbor.

END OF SUMMARY.
