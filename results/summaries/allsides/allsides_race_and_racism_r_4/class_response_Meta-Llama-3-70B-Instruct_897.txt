SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before killing a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since April 2018, is on administrative leave pending an investigation into the fatal shooting. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called the shooting "murder," stating that the officer didn't shout "Gun, gun, gun" before firing. The police department's statement claimed the officer perceived a threat, but Merritt disputed this, saying the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat. The family is seeking "justice" and demanding answers, with Jefferson's sister, Amber Carr, saying, "You want to see justice, but justice don't bring my sister back." The incident has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
