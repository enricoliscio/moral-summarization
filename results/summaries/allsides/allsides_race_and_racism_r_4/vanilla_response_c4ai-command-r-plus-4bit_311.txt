SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's non-emergency call about an open front door. The officer, who has not been named, did not announce he was police before firing a shot through a window, killing Jefferson. An attorney for Jefferson's family, Lee Merritt, stated that the bodycam footage showed the officer did not have time to perceive a threat and that the shooting was murder. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage but blurred still frames of a gun found inside the bedroom, though it is unclear if the firearm was near Jefferson. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for justice, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling on the Justice Department to investigate. The incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced for the fatal shooting of her black neighbor, highlighting ongoing concerns about police shootings of unarmed black individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
