Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the words the author used, like "killed," "murder," and "justice." First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about a police officer killing Atatiana Jefferson in her home. The officer shot her through the window without announcing himself. Her family is devastated, feeling that justice isn't served. The officer is on administrative leave, and there's an investigation. The neighbor who called the police feels responsible and upset.

I need to include the morally charged words without making the summary too long. I should mention the key points: the shooting, the officer's lack of announcement, the family's reaction, the investigation, and the broader context of police violence against Black Americans.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the tragedy, the officer's actions, family's emotional state, and the call for justice. I'll make sure to use words like "killed," "murder," "justice," and "transparency" as per the author's framing.

Let me draft this, keeping it concise and within 200 words. I'll start with the incident, mention the officer's failure to announce, the family's statements, the investigation, and the broader implications. I'll end with the call for justice and accountability.

SUMMARY: A Fort Worth police officer killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. Attorney Lee Merritt argued that the officer "didn’t have time to perceive a threat" before firing, calling it "murder." Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed. Her family expressed confusion and grief, stating they don’t understand why she was killed. Police Lt. Brandon O’Neil confirmed the officer fired without announcing he was police, and the officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The family expects a "thorough and expedient investigation," while the police department released bodycam footage, though details remain unclear. The shooting has sparked calls for justice and accountability, with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders urging the Justice Department to investigate. This incident follows the recent sentencing of a former Dallas police officer for killing a Black neighbor, highlighting ongoing issues of police violence against Black Americans. The family seeks justice but acknowledges it cannot bring Jefferson back. END OF SUMMARY.
