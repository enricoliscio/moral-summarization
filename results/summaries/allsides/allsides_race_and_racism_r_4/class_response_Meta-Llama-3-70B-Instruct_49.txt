SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before killing a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since April 2018, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, viewed the bodycam footage and said the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat. That's murder." The police department's statement claimed the officer perceived a threat, but the video shows no warning or shout of "gun" before the shot was fired. Jefferson's family is seeking justice and demanding answers, with her sister saying, "You want to see justice, but justice don't bring my sister back." The incident has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end."
