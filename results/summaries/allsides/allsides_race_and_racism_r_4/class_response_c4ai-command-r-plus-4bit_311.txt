SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her Texas home after responding to a call about an open front door. An attorney for Jefferson's family, Lee Merritt, stated that the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and that the shooting was "murder." Jefferson's family expressed their grief and confusion about her loss, while the Fort Worth Police Department placed the officer on administrative leave pending an investigation. The incident has sparked outrage and calls for justice, with Senator Bernie Sanders requesting a Justice Department investigation. The shooting comes soon after a similar incident in Dallas, where a white former police officer was sentenced to 10 years for murdering her black neighbor. Merritt also represents the victim's family in that case.

END OF SUMMARY.
