SUMMARY:
A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, responded to a call about an open front door and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer did not shout "Gun, gun, gun" or give Jefferson a chance to respond before firing, which her family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called "murder." The police department released bodycam footage showing the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing through a window. Jefferson's family is seeking justice and answers, calling the situation "inconceivable" and "confusing." The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
