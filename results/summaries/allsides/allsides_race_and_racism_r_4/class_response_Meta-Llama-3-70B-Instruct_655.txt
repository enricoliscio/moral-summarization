SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, has been accused of murder after killing a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and his failure to do so is part of the investigation. The officer's bodycam footage shows him shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing through a window, without perceiving a threat. Jefferson's family has called the shooting "inconceivable" and "murder," and is seeking "justice" and a thorough investigation. The community is shaken, with one neighbor saying he feels partly responsible for the tragedy. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage to provide transparency, but the investigation is ongoing. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end."
