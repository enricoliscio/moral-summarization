Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a police officer killing a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The family's attorney is calling it murder because the officer didn't perceive a threat before shooting. The family is devastated and confused, especially since her nephew was present. The officer didn't announce himself before firing, which is part of the investigation. A neighbor who called the police feels responsible and upset. The police department released some video but not the inside footage. There's mention of a gun found in the home, but it's unclear if the officer thought she had it. The article also connects this to a previous case where a white officer killed a black man, leading to a 10-year sentence. Bernie Sanders is calling for a federal investigation.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: the shooting, the family's reaction, the officer's actions, the neighbor's role, the police response, and the broader context of similar cases. I should highlight the moral issues like the officer's failure to announce, the family's loss, and the systemic issue of police violence against black people. Keeping it under 200 words and ending with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: A Fort Worth police officer shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. Attorney Lee Merritt, representing Jefferson's family, argued that the officer "didn’t have time to perceive a threat" before firing, calling it murder. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the shooting. Police stated that officers saw someone near a window and perceived a threat before firing, but the released bodycam footage shows no announcement of police presence before the shot was fired. The family expressed confusion and grief, with Jefferson’s sister stating, “It’s another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us.” The officer involved is on administrative leave, and an investigation is underway. A neighbor who called police expressed regret, feeling partly responsible for Jefferson’s death. Police found a firearm in the home but have not confirmed if the officer believed Jefferson was armed. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a federal investigation, highlighting the need to end the killings of unarmed Black Americans. This case follows a similar incident in Dallas, where a white officer was sentenced for killing a Black man. END OF SUMMARY.
