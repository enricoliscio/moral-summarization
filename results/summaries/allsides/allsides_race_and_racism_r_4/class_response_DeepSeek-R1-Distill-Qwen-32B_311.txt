Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me go through the article step by step.

First, the article is about a police officer killing a black woman in Texas. The officer didn't announce himself before shooting, which is a key point. The family's attorney called it murder. The officer was on administrative leave, and there's an investigation.

I should include words like "killed," "murder," "justice," "protect," etc. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by mentioning the killing, the officer's lack of announcement, the family's reaction, the police's response, the neighbor's regret, and the broader context of police violence. I'll make sure to incorporate as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all critical points without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it and check the word count.

SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who did not announce himself before firing, is on administrative leave as an investigation proceeds. Attorney Lee Merritt called the shooting "murder," stating the officer had no time to perceive a threat. Jefferson's family expressed shock and confusion, emphasizing the loss and the failure of justice. Police Lt. Brandon Oâ€™Neil confirmed the officer did not announce his identity before firing and that Jefferson's 8-year-old nephew was in the room. A neighbor who called police expressed regret, feeling partly responsible for her death. The Fort Worth Police Department released bodycam footage, but details about whether Jefferson posed a threat remain unclear. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a Justice Department investigation, highlighting the need to end the killings of unarmed Black Americans. The shooting follows a similar case in Dallas, where a former officer was sentenced for murder. The family seeks a thorough investigation to address the inconceivable loss and ensure justice. END OF SUMMARY.
