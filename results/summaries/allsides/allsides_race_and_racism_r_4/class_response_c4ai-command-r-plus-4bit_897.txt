SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman inside her Texas home, with the officer's bodycam footage suggesting that he "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before opening fire. The woman, Atatiana Jefferson, was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. While the police statement claimed the officer fired after "perceiving a threat," the bodycam video and the attorney for Jefferson's family suggest otherwise, calling the shooting "murder." This incident has left the family confused and seeking justice, with the police officer now on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for a thorough investigation, with similarities drawn to the recent case of a white police officer being sentenced for the murder of her black neighbor.
END OF SUMMARY.
