SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her own home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and his bodycam footage shows he did not perceive a threat before opening fire. The woman's family and attorney claim it was murder, and the family is seeking justice. The police department has released bodycam footage and is conducting an investigation, but the family is still seeking answers. The incident has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation. The shooting is eerily similar to another recent incident in Dallas, where a white police officer was convicted of murder for killing her black neighbor in his own apartment. The senseless killing of unarmed black Americans must end.

END OF SUMMARY.
