SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before firing, which an attorney for Jefferson's family called "murder." The officer did not announce himself as police before shooting Jefferson, who was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. The family is seeking "justice" and an "investigation" into the fatal shooting, which they consider an "unspeakable loss." The police department has released bodycam footage, but the family is still seeking "transparency" and answers. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "the killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." The community is left "shaken," "upset," and seeking "justice" for Jefferson's senseless killing. END OF SUMMARY.
