SUMMARY: A white police officer in Texas killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, inside her own home after responding to a non-emergency call about an open front door. The officer, who has not been named, did not announce himself as police before opening fire, and the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, has called the shooting "murder," stating that the officer did not have time to perceive a threat. This incident has once again brought attention to the issue of police brutality against unarmed black Americans, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling on the Justice Department to investigate. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident, but the family and their supporters are demanding a thorough and expedient investigation. This shooting comes just two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced for the fatal shooting of her black neighbor, highlighting the ongoing issue of racial injustice and police brutality in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
