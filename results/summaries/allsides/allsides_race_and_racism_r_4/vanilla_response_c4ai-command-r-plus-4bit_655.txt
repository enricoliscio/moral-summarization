SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has not been named, did not announce he was police before firing a shot through a window. Jefferson's family and their attorney, Lee Merritt, have viewed bodycam footage of the incident and believe the shooting was unjustified and amounted to murder. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage to the media, which included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom, but it is unclear if the firearm was found near Jefferson. The department has stated that the officer involved is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and calls for justice, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders urging the Justice Department to investigate. This incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced for the fatal shooting of her black neighbor, highlighting ongoing concerns about police shootings of unarmed black individuals.
END OF SUMMARY.
