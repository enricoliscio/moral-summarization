Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article is about a police shooting in Fort Worth, Texas. A white officer shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The family's attorney called it murder because the officer didn't perceive a threat before shooting. The family is devastated, questioning why she was killed. The police say the officer saw a threat, but the video shows he didn't announce himself before firing. The officer is on leave, and an investigation is ongoing. A neighbor who called the police feels guilty, and there's a mention of another recent case where a police officer was sentenced for a similar killing. Bernie Sanders is calling for federal investigation.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: killed, opened, shooting, murder, protect, justice, nothing, announce, fired, shot, shared, concern, loss, shaken, upset, investigation, transparency, killings, end.

I'll start by stating the incident, using "killed" and "shooting." Mention the family's attorney calling it murder. Highlight the family's emotional state and their demand for justice. Include the police's side but note the lack of announcement, which is a moral point. Mention the neighbor's guilt and the ongoing investigation. Reference the previous case and Bernie Sanders' call for action. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me structure it: incident, family's perspective, police response, neighbor's feelings, investigation, and broader context. Use the moral words naturally in the flow.
