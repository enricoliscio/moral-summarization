SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her Texas home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce he was police before firing a shot through a window, killing Jefferson. An attorney for Jefferson's family called the shooting "murder," saying the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat. Fort Worth Police confirmed that Jefferson's 8-year-old nephew was in the room at the time and that the officer failed to announce himself, which is part of the department's investigation. The neighbor who called the non-emergency line said he felt partly responsible for Jefferson's death, but that he was just trying to be a good neighbor. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
