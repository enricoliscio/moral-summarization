SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her own home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself before firing, and the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called it "murder" because the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat. The video shows the officer shouting "Put your hands up" before firing through a window, killing Jefferson, who was watching her 8-year-old nephew. The family is seeking justice, but acknowledges it won't bring Jefferson back. The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." The incident is eerily similar to the recent conviction of a white former Dallas police officer who murdered her black neighbor, highlighting the ongoing issue of racial violence and police brutality.

END OF SUMMARY.
