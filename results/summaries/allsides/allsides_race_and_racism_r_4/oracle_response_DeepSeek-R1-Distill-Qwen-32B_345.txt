Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The incident involves a white police officer killing a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The family's attorney called it murder, and the police stated that the officer perceived a threat. The officer didn't announce his presence before shooting, and the family is seeking justice. There's also mention of the officer being on administrative leave and an ongoing investigation. Additionally, a neighbor who called the police feels responsible and upset. The article also ties this incident to previous cases of police violence against Black Americans, with a call for justice from Bernie Sanders.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words from the author's list: killed, opened, shooting, murder, protect, justice, nothing, announce, fired, shot, shared, concern, loss, shaken, upset, investigation, transparency, killings, end. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary.

I'll structure the summary to include the key events: the officer's actions, the family's reaction, the police response, the neighbor's feelings, and the broader context of police violence. I'll make sure to use the moral terms to convey the gravity of the situation and the family's quest for justice.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically, highlighting the moral issues involved. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, using the specified words to frame the narrative.

SUMMARY: A white Fort Worth police officer killed 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, a Black woman, inside her home after responding to a neighbor’s call about an open front door. Attorney Lee Merritt labeled the incident as murder, stating the officer didn’t have time to perceive a threat before firing. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was shot. Her family expressed confusion and grief, questioning why she was killed. Police Lt. Brandon O’Neil confirmed the officer was on administrative leave and would be interviewed, but declined to provide further details. The officer did not announce his presence before firing, and Jefferson’s nephew was in the room at the time of the shooting. Neighbor James Smith, who called police, expressed guilt and regret, feeling partly responsible for her death. The Fort Worth Police Department released bodycam footage, but state law prevented sharing footage inside the residence. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a Justice Department investigation, emphasizing the need to end killings of unarmed Black Americans. The case highlights the ongoing issue of police violence against Black individuals. END OF SUMMARY.
