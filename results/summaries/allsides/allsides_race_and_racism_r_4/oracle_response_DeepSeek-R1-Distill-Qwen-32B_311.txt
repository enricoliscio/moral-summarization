Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a police officer killing a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer was responding to a neighbor's call about an open door. The family's attorney called it murder because the officer didn't announce himself and didn't perceive a threat before shooting. The police say they saw someone near a window and perceived a threat, but the video shows the officer didn't announce he was police before firing. The family is devastated, feeling that the police aren't protecting them. The officer is on administrative leave, and there's an ongoing investigation. The neighbor who called is regretting his action, feeling partly responsible. The police released some bodycam footage but not the inside footage. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for the Justice Department to investigate, linking it to another recent case where a white officer killed a black man.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary, using as many of the moral words as possible. I'll structure it to include the key points: the killing, the officer's actions, the family's reaction, the police's response, the neighbor's regret, and the call for justice. I should make sure to highlight the moral issues like murder, protection, justice, and the failure to announce, etc.

I'll start by stating the killing, then the circumstances, the family's attorney's claim of murder, the police's version, the lack of announcement, the family's emotional state, the officer's leave, the neighbor's regret, the police's transparency, and the call for justice. I'll keep each sentence tight to stay within 200 words.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each moral point without being too wordy. Let me piece it together, making sure to include all the key moral elements and keep the summary under 200 words.

SUMMARY: A white Fort Worth police officer killed 28-year-old black woman Atatiana Jefferson inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. Attorney Lee Merritt labeled the incident "murder," stating the officer didn't announce himself or perceive a threat before firing. The family expressed devastation, questioning why Jefferson was killed while protecting her 8-year-old nephew. Police claimed they perceived a threat but released bodycam footage showing no announcement before the fatal shot. The officer is on administrative leave as an investigation continues. Neighbor James Smith, who called police, felt guilt, saying Jefferson would still be alive if he hadn't acted. The family seeks a thorough investigation, while Fort Worth Police emphasized transparency, though internal footage remains unavailable. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for federal intervention, linking the killing to systemic injustices. The case highlights failures in police protocol and community trust. END OF SUMMARY.
