Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The user is asking for a summary that's under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also want the moral perspective maintained, which means I should highlight the key ethical issues presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a police officer who shot and killed Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman, inside her home. The officer was responding to a neighbor's call about an open door. The family's attorney argues that the officer didn't perceive a threat before shooting, calling it murder. The police say the officer perceived a threat and fired, but the video shows the officer didn't announce himself before firing. The family is devastated, feeling the system failed them. A Democratic candidate called for federal investigation, and this incident is part of a pattern of police violence against black people.

I need to capture the moral issues: the use of excessive force, lack of accountability, and systemic issues in policing. Also, the emotional impact on the family and the broader societal implications.

I'll structure the summary to include the key points: the shooting, the officer's actions, the family's reaction, the police's response, the legal context, and the call for justice. I should keep it concise but include all necessary elements to convey the moral framing.

I need to make sure the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. Let me outline the main points to include:

1. Officer shoots Atatiana Jefferson inside her home.
2. Neighbor called police about open door.
3. Attorney says no threat perceived, calling it murder.
4. Police say officer perceived threat but didn't announce himself.
5. Family devastated, questioning why she was killed.
6. Officer on administrative leave, investigation ongoing.
7. Context of previous similar case (Amber Guyger).
8. Sanders calls for Justice Department investigation.
9. Highlight systemic issues and lack of accountability.

Now, I'll condense these points into a coherent summary, ensuring the moral issues are clear. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language straightforward.
