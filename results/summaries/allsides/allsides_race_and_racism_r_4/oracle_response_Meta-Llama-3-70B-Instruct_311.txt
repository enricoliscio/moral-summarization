SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before he opened fire, according to an attorney for the woman's family, who called it "murder." The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, which is part of the department's investigation. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was shot. Her family is seeking "justice" and is confused about why she was killed. The police department released bodycam footage to provide "transparency," but it's unclear if the officer thought Jefferson had a gun. The family's attorney said the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and that "it's another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us." Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders called for a Justice Department investigation, saying "the killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end."
