SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, committed "murder" by killing a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before opening fire, according to Jefferson's family attorney. The police department's statement claimed the officer perceived a threat, but the bodycam video shows no warning or shout of "Gun, gun, gun" before the fatal shot. Jefferson's family is seeking "justice" and demanding to know why she was killed. The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation, which the family expects to be "thorough and expedient." The community is outraged, with many feeling that the police are not there to "protect" them. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has called for a Justice Department investigation, stating that "the killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
