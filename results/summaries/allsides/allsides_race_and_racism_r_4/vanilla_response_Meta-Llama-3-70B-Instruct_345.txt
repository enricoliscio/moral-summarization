SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and his bodycam footage shows he did not perceive a threat before opening fire. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the shooting. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The police department has released bodycam footage and confirmed that the officer did not announce himself before firing. The family is demanding justice and calling for a thorough investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation.
