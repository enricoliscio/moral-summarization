SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before opening fire, which the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called "murder." The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and his failure to do so is part of the investigation. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time of the shooting. The family is seeking "justice" and demanding a thorough and expedient investigation. The police department released bodycam footage to provide "transparency," but the family and community are left with a sense of "loss" and "concern." The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
