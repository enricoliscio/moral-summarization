SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot. The bodycam video shows the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing through a window. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, said the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and that it's "murder." The family is seeking justice and an explanation for the shooting. The incident has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation. The shooting comes less than two weeks after a similar incident in Dallas, where a white former police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for murdering her black neighbor.
