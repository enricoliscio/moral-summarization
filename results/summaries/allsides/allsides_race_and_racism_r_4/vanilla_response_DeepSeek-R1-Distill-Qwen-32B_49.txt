Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a police shooting in Fort Worth, Texas. A white officer shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, says the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat, calling it murder. The police say the officer perceived a threat before firing. 

The family is devastated. Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed. Her sister, Amber Carr, is upset about the lack of protection from the police. An aunt, Venitta Body, is confused about why Jefferson was killed. 

The officer involved is on administrative leave and will be interviewed. The police released bodycam footage, but some parts are blurred, showing a gun in the home. It's unclear if Jefferson had the gun. The family expects a thorough investigation. 

A neighbor called the police about an open door, feeling responsible for her death. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for the Justice Department to investigate. This case is similar to another recent case where a Dallas officer killed a black man, Botham Jean, who was unarmed.

So, the key points are: police shooting, family's reaction, lack of clear threat, officer's actions, neighbor's role, and the call for justice. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and reactions.

I should structure it by introducing the incident, the family's perspective, the police response, the context of the call, and the broader implications. Make sure to include that the officer didn't announce himself before shooting and the presence of a gun in the home, though its relation to Jefferson isn't clear.

Also, mention the similar case in Dallas to highlight the pattern. Keep it concise, sticking to the facts without too much detail. Make sure the summary flows logically from the incident to the reactions and context.
