SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman, inside her own home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and his bodycam video shows he did not give Jefferson a chance to respond before shooting. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called the shooting "murder" and said the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat." Jefferson's family is seeking justice, but they are confused and grieving, with her sister saying, "You want to see justice, but justice don't bring my sister back." The police department has released bodycam footage and is conducting an investigation, but the family and many others, including Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, are calling for greater accountability and an end to the killings of unarmed black Americans.

END OF SUMMARY.
