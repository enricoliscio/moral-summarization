SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her Texas home, sparking outrage and demands for justice. The officer, who did not announce he was police, fired a shot through a window after perceiving a threat. However, Jefferson's family and their attorney, Lee Merritt, argue that the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat and that the shooting was murder. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage of the incident but blurred still frames of a gun found inside the bedroom, the relevance of which is unclear. The shooting has led to calls for an investigation, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders urging the Justice Department to get involved. This incident comes just two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of her black neighbor, highlighting ongoing concerns about the killings of unarmed black Americans. The Fort Worth Police Department has expressed concern over the "unspeakable loss" and has placed the officer on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
