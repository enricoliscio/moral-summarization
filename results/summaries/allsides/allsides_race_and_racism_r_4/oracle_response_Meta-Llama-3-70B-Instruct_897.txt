SUMMARY: A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, "didn't have time to perceive a threat" before shooting and killing 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer's bodycam video shows him firing a shot through a window without announcing himself as police, which the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, calls "murder." Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. The police department claims the officer perceived a threat, but Merritt argues that the officer didn't have time to do so. The family is seeking "justice" and demanding answers, with Jefferson's sister saying, "You want to see justice, but justice don't bring my sister back." The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation, and the police department has expressed "serious and heartfelt concern" for the "unspeakable loss." The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
