SUMMARY:
A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, responded to a neighbor's call about an open front door and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer did not shout "Gun, gun, gun" before firing, and the family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called it "murder." The police department released bodycam footage showing the officer firing through a window without announcing himself. Jefferson's family is seeking "justice" and is "shaken," "mad," and "upset" over the "unspeakable" loss. The officer is on administrative leave, and the department is investigating the fatal shooting. The family wants a "thorough and expedient investigation" into the "inconceivable" and "confusing" incident. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders called for a Justice Department investigation, saying "the killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." END OF SUMMARY.
