SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her Texas home, sparking outrage and demands for justice from her family and community. The officer, who has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, did not announce himself as police before firing a shot through a window, perceiving a threat. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, called the shooting "murder," stating that the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat and failed to follow proper protocol. This incident comes at a time when the killings of unarmed black Americans are under scrutiny, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage, but questions remain, including why Jefferson was killed and whether the officer believed she had a gun. The department expressed concern for the "unspeakable loss" and has promised a thorough investigation. The community is shaken and confused, with Jefferson's family seeking answers and justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
