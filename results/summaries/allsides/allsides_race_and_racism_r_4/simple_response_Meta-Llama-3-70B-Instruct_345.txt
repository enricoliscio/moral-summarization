SUMMARY:

A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed a 28-year-old black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself before firing, and the family's attorney claims he didn't have time to perceive a threat, calling it "murder." The police department released bodycam footage showing the officer shouting "Put your hands up, show me your hands" before firing through a window. The family is seeking justice, but acknowledges that it won't bring Jefferson back. The officer is on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." This incident comes less than two weeks after a similar fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer in Dallas.
