SUMMARY: A white police officer killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her Texas home, sparking outrage and demands for justice. The officer, responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door, fired a shot through a window, perceiving a threat. Jefferson's family and their attorney, Lee Merritt, believe the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat and that the shooting was murder. They expect a thorough investigation. The Fort Worth Police Department has released bodycam footage but blurred still frames showing a gun inside the home, adding to the confusion surrounding the incident. This incident comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years for the murder of her black neighbor. The killings of unarmed Black Americans have been denounced by Senator Bernie Sanders, who called for a Justice Department investigation. The police department has expressed concern over the loss, but the family is left with unanswered questions.
END OF SUMMARY.
