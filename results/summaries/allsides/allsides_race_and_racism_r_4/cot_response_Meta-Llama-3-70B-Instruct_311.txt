SUMMARY:
A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman, inside her home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, which is part of the investigation. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, said the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and that it's "murder." The family is seeking justice, but they acknowledge that it won't bring Jefferson back. The neighbor who called the police is shaken, mad, and upset, feeling partly responsible for Jefferson's death. The police department has released bodycam footage, but the investigation is ongoing. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has called for a Justice Department investigation, saying "the killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end."
END OF SUMMARY.
