SUMMARY:
A white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, shot and killed 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman, inside her own home while responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The officer did not announce himself as police before firing the fatal shot, and his failure to do so is part of the department's investigation. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, said the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat" and that it's "murder." The family is seeking "justice" and a "thorough and expedient investigation." The shooting has sparked outrage, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for a Justice Department investigation, saying "the killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end." The incident has left the family and community feeling "shaken," "mad," and "upset," with a sense of "injustice" and "confusion." END OF SUMMARY.
