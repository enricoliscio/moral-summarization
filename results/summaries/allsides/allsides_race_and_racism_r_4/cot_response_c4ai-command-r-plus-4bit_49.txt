SUMMARY: A white police officer killed an innocent black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her Texas home. An attorney for Jefferson's family called the shooting "murder," stating that the officer "didn't have time to perceive a threat." The family is demanding justice and an expedient investigation. Fort Worth police have released bodycam footage of the incident, but it has only added to the confusion surrounding the shooting. The officer, who has been placed on administrative leave, failed to announce himself before firing the fatal shot. The killing has sparked outrage, with many calling for a thorough investigation and an end to the unjustified killing of unarmed black Americans. This incident follows the recent conviction of a white former Dallas police officer for the murder of her black neighbor.
