Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main event is a police officer killing a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer responded to a neighbor's call about an open door. The family's attorney claims the officer didn't perceive a threat before shooting, calling it murder. The police statement says the officer perceived a threat, but the video shows he didn't announce himself before firing. The family is devastated, questioning why she was killed. The officer is on administrative leave, and an investigation is ongoing. A Democratic candidate called for federal investigation, linking it to another recent case.

I need to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "killed," "shooting," "murder," "threat," "protect," "justice," etc., should be incorporated. I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between the officer's actions and the family's perspective, emphasizing the moral issues involved. I'll also mention the broader context of police violence against Black Americans and the call for justice.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally. I'll start with the incident, then the family's response, the police's account, the officer's status, and end with the call for investigation and the broader implications. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and impactful.

SUMMARY: A Fort Worth police officer killed Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, inside her home after responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. Attorney Lee Merritt argued that the officer "didnâ€™t have time to perceive a threat" before firing, calling the shooting "murder." Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew at the time. Police stated that officers perceived a threat before firing, but the bodycam video shows the officer did not announce himself before shooting. The family expressed confusion and grief, questioning why Jefferson was killed. The officer, who has been on the force since 2018, is on administrative leave as part of an investigation. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a federal investigation, linking the case to the recent sentencing of a former Dallas police officer for murdering a Black neighbor. The family seeks justice and a thorough investigation, emphasizing the loss and unconscionable nature of the incident. END OF SUMMARY.
