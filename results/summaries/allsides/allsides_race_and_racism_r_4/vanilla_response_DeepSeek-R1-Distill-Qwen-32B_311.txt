Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the shooting of Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth, Texas. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

So, a white police officer shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, inside her home. The officer was responding to a neighbor's call about an open front door. The family's attorney, Lee Merritt, claims the officer didn't have time to perceive a threat before shooting, calling it murder. The police department's statement says the officer perceived a threat and fired. The video from the bodycam shows the officer shouting "Put your hands up" before firing through a window. 

Jefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed. Her family is confused and upset, questioning why she was killed. The officer is on administrative leave and will be interviewed. The police chief will hold a news conference. The neighbor who called the police feels responsible and upset. The police released some bodycam footage, but it's unclear if Jefferson had a gun. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called for a Justice Department investigation. This incident is similar to another case where a Dallas police officer was sentenced for killing a black man.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll start with the main event: the police officer killed Jefferson. Mention the neighbor's call, the officer's action, and the family's reaction. Include the police's response and the ongoing investigation. Also, note the similar case and Sanders' call for an investigation. Make sure to keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.
