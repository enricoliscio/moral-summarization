SUMMARY:

A suspicious attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed, and the perpetrators may face FBI investigation. The scheme, allegedly involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to drum up false claims against Mueller. Wohl, a 20-year-old Trump supporter, has a history of making implausible claims and running shady hedge funds. Burkman, a Republican lobbyist, has repeatedly made false claims, including conspiracy theories. The plot involved a supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, which appears to be a one-man operation run by Wohl. The duo's attempt to smear Mueller has backfired, with the FBI now investigating the matter. The episode has also wasted journalistic resources, with several media outlets devoting attention to debunking the false claims. Burkman still plans to hold a press conference, but it is likely to be a dud. The whole ordeal reeks of a scam to troll journalists and change the subject ahead of the midterm elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
