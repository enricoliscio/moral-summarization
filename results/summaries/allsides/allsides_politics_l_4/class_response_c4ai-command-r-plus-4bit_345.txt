SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed and referred to the FBI. Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative known for his sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and shady hedge funds, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, appear to be involved. Wohl and Burkman may have been trolling the media or specifically targeting Mueller, or Wohl may have been tricking Burkman. Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations, was exposed as a sham, with Jacob Wohl being the sole employee. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller, but later took it down. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI and stated that they will not tolerate such schemes and smear attempts. This incident highlights the lengths to which some will go to discredit legitimate investigations, and the importance of journalists in debunking false claims and scams.

END OF SUMMARY.
