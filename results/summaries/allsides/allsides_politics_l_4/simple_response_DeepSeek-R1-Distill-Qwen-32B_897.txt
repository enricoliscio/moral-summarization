Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. The key is to highlight the unethical behavior and the implications.

I should start by identifying the main actors: Wohl, Burkman, and the company Surefire Intelligence. The article mentions that they were trying to offer money to women to make false claims, which is a clear moral issue. Mueller's office reported it to the FBI, showing the seriousness of the situation.

Next, I need to include the details about how the plot unfolded, the redacted document, and the media's reaction. It's important to note that the scheme backfired, leading to public exposure and FBI involvement. The moral framing here is about the unethical manipulation of information to discredit Mueller, which undermines the integrity of the investigation.

I should also mention the potential impact on media resources and the midterm elections, emphasizing how this distraction could have broader implications. Burkman's continued claims add to the story, showing that the issue isn't resolved yet.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the critical points while maintaining the moral perspective of the original article.

SUMMARY: A scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller unraveled recently, involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a pro-Trump figure known for making dubious claims, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were linked to a plot to offer money to women to make false accusations. Mueller’s office referred the matter to the FBI after learning of the allegations. The scheme, which appeared to be a smear attempt, involved a fake private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, run by Wohl. Journalists and online sleuths exposed the scam, revealing it to be a thin and unethical attempt to discredit Mueller. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly published a redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller before removing it. The FBI is now investigating, and Wohl may face consequences. The incident highlights the unethical manipulation of information to undermine Mueller’s credibility, while also diverting media attention from other issues. Burkman continues to claim he will reveal Mueller’s alleged victims, but his credibility is questionable. END OF SUMMARY.
