Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. The scheme seems to have backfired, and the FBI is investigating. 

I should identify the key elements: who was involved, what happened, the moral implications. The author uses words like "offered," "scheme," "smear," "plot," "scam," etc. I need to include as many of these as possible without making the summary too long. 

I'll start by mentioning the attempt to create fake allegations, involving Wohl and Burkman. Then, note that Mueller's office reported it to the FBI. Highlight that the scheme was thin and backfired, with Surefire Intelligence being exposed as fake. Mention the redacted document and the media attention it garnered, which diverted resources away from other issues. Also, note that Burkman is still claiming to reveal Mueller's victims, but it's likely another scam. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the morally charged words. I'll structure it to flow from the initial attempt, the involvement of the individuals, the exposure, and the consequences. 

Let me check if I'm including all the necessary terms without making it sound forced. I think I've covered the main points and the moral framing. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY:  
An attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has unraveled, potentially implicating conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Mueller’s office referred the matter to the FBI after learning of claims that women were offered money to make false accusations. The scheme, which appeared to be a smear attempt, involved Wohl, a pro-Trump Twitter personality, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist with a history of making dubious claims. The operation, which seemed like a scam, involved a fake private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, allegedly run by Wohl. A redacted document alleging rape against Mueller was briefly posted by a far-right website, sparking media attention and public skepticism. The FBI is now investigating, and Wohl may face consequences if the allegations are proven. The attempt, which may have been an effort to troll journalists and divert attention, succeeded in generating media coverage, diverting resources away from other issues. Burkman continues to claim he will reveal Mueller’s victims, but his credibility is questionable. The whole affair highlights the potential for manipulation and misinformation in political contexts.  
END OF SUMMARY.
