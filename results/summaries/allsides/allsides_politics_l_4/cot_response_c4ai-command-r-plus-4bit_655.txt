SUMMARY:
An apparent attempt to fabricate phony sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller was exposed and referred to the FBI on Tuesday. The scheme, which appeared to be orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, was described as a "shady operation" that caused alarm among journalists. Wohl and Burkman have a history of dubious claims and conspiracy theories. Despite the thin evidence and questionable credibility of the accusers, the far-right conspiracist website Gateway Pundit published heavily redacted documents making rape allegations against Mueller. The document was later removed amid serious allegations of trolling and embarrassment against Wohl. While the FBI investigates, Wohl may ultimately be the loser in this scenario, as the media devoted scarce resources to debunking his dubious claims just days before the midterm elections. Burkman continues to promise a "dud" press conference, but it remains to be seen if this is another attempt to steal the spotlight and change the subject. END OF SUMMARY.
