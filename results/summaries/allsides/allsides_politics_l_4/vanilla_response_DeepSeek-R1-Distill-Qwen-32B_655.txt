Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It seems like some conservative activists were involved, and it backfired.

First, the key points: Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman are mentioned. Wohl is a pro-Trump Twitter personality, and Burkman is a Republican lobbyist with a history of making false claims. They were involved in a scheme to offer money to women to make false allegations against Mueller. This was reported to the FBI by Mueller's office.

The article mentions that the plan was poorly executed and ended up making the whole thing public. The website Surefire Intelligence was involved, but it turned out to be fake. Gateway Pundit posted a redacted document with a rape allegation, but they took it down after criticism.

The summary needs to capture that the plot was to create fake allegations, who was involved, how it was exposed, and the consequences like FBI involvement. Also, note that the media covered it, which might have been part of the plan to divert attention.

I should structure the summary to include the main actors, the nature of the scam, the involvement of the FBI, and the outcome. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and includes all necessary details without getting too bogged down in specifics.

SUMMARY: A scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller was exposed, involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a pro-Trump Twitter personality, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist with a history of false claims, were linked to the plot, which aimed to offer money to women to make false accusations. Muellerâ€™s office referred the matter to the FBI. The operation unraveled when details emerged, revealing that the supposed private intelligence firm, Surefire, was likely a sham run by Wohl. Gateway Pundit, a far-right website, briefly published a redacted document alleging rape against Mueller before retracting it. The FBI is now investigating, and the scheme, though poorly executed, may have succeeded in diverting media attention. Burkman continues to promise revelations, but past claims have proven baseless. The incident highlights the potential for misinformation and manipulation in the media landscape. END OF SUMMARY.
