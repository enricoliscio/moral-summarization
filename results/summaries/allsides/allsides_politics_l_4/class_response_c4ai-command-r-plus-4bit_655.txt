SUMMARY: Conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman were behind an embarrassingly thin scam to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Wohl, known for his sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and dubious claims, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have been involved in a plot to smear Mueller. They created a fake private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, to investigate the allegations, but internet sleuths quickly exposed Wohl as the only person behind it. Despite the far-right website Gateway Pundit posting a heavily redacted document with a rape allegation against Mueller, the scam was soon debunked and referred to the FBI for investigation. While Wohl may have succeeded in trolling journalists and stealing the spotlight ahead of the midterm elections, he ultimately lost, with his claims being widely dismissed and his tactics exposed. Burkman continues to insist that he will reveal Mueller's "victims," but his claims are likely to be false, as with his previous hyped press conferences. This attempted smear campaign and its aftermath demonstrate the lengths to which some will go to discredit those they oppose, and the importance of journalists and internet researchers in uncovering the truth.
END OF SUMMARY.
