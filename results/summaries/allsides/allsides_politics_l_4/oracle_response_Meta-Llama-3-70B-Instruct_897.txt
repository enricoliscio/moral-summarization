SUMMARY:

A suspicious attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller collapsed on Tuesday, and may have landed conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The apparent scam involved Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, who may have been trying to make false claims about Mueller. The plot was embarrassingly thin and easily debunked, but not before it stole the spotlight and wasted journalistic resources just days before the midterm elections. Wohl and Burkman's operation was exposed when they tried to convince journalists and the public of the allegations, but their claims were implausible and factually dubious. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and if found guilty, Wohl and Burkman may face consequences for their attempt to smear Mueller and undermine the investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
