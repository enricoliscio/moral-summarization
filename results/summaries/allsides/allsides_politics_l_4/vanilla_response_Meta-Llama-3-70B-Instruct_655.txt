SUMMARY:

An apparent attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has failed, and may have led to FBI investigation. The scheme involved Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist. They may have offered money to women to make false claims against Mueller. The plot was exposed after Wohl hinted at a story about the allegations on Twitter, and journalists reacted with alarm. An investigation by internet sleuths revealed that Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company behind the allegations, was likely a fake company run by Wohl. The Gateway Pundit website posted a redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but later took it down. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. The incident has sparked debate about the impact of trolling on journalism and the political discourse.
