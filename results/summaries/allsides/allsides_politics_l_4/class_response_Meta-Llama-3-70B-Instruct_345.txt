SUMMARY:

A dubious scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller was exposed, and it may land conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The plot, allegedly involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to drum up false claims against Mueller. Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, has a history of sending sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and making implausible claims. Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, has repeatedly made false claims. The scam was embarrassingly thin, and internet sleuths quickly debunked it. The FBI is now investigating the matter after Mueller's office referred the allegations. The morally bankrupt attempt to smear Mueller may have succeeded in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject, but it's unclear if Burkman was also being tricked or was a willing participant. The FBI's investigation will reveal the truth behind this shameful scheme. END OF SUMMARY.
