SUMMARY: A shady attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller was exposed and referred to the FBI for investigation. Conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman appear to be involved in this plot, which was quickly debunked by journalists and online researchers. Wohl and Burkman may have been trolling the media or trying to smear Mueller and the investigation. The whole scheme was an embarrassingly thin scam, with Wohl potentially tricking Burkman or being a willing participant. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but it was taken down amid Twitter mockery. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, and the ultimate outcome of this debacle remains to be seen. Burkman still insists on revealing Mueller's "victims," but his claims are dubious at best. While Wohl may face consequences from the FBI, he has already succeeded in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject, if that was his intention. 

END OF SUMMARY.
