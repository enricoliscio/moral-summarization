Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a news article about an attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller. My task is to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing the author used.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. It's about Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman possibly trying to create false allegations against Mueller. The article mentions that Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI. There's also the aspect of how this affected media coverage and the potential consequences for Wohl and Burkman.

I should focus on the moral implications here. The article highlights the unethical behavior of attempting to create fake allegations, which is a smear tactic. It's important to note that this could have diverted media attention away from more critical issues, especially near the midterm elections.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main elements: who was involved, what they did, the involvement of the FBI, the media's reaction, and the potential consequences. Also, I should maintain the author's critical tone towards Wohl and Burkman's actions.

I should structure the summary to first mention the attempt to create fake allegations, then the individuals involved, the FBI's involvement, the media's response, and the implications of their actions. Ending with the potential consequences for Wohl and Burkman ties it all together.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content without adding any personal opinions beyond what's presented. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements and maintain the moral framing. I'll start by stating the attempt, then the individuals, the FBI referral, the media's reaction, the implication on resources, and the possible outcomes for the individuals involved.

SUMMARY: A scheme to fabricate false sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller appears to have unraveled, potentially implicating conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Mueller’s office referred the matter to the FBI after learning of the alleged plan to offer women money to make false claims. Wohl, a pro-Trump social media personality, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were reportedly involved in promoting the scheme through a fake intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence. The operation seemed designed to smear Mueller while diverting media attention, with outlets dedicating resources to debunk the claims. Burkman insists he will reveal Mueller’s alleged victims, but his credibility is questionable. The FBI is now investigating, and Wohl may face consequences if the scheme was real. The attempt highlights the unethical use of false allegations to manipulate public perception and media coverage. END OF SUMMARY.
