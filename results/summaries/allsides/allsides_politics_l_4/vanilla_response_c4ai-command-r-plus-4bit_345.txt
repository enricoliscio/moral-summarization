SUMMARY: An attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller fell apart on Tuesday, leading to an FBI investigation. Conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman appear to be involved in the plot, which was quickly exposed as a scam by journalists and online researchers. Wohl and Burkman may have been trolling the media or attempting to smear Mueller and the investigation. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, and the far-right website Gateway Pundit, for which Wohl writes, briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller before taking it down. Burkman continues to claim that he will reveal Mueller's "victims," but his previous press conferences have been duds. While Wohl may face consequences depending on the FBI's findings, the scam succeeded in diverting media attention and resources away from other topics just days before the midterm elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
