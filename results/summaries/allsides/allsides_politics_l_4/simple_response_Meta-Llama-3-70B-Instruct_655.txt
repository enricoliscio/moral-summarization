SUMMARY:

A deceitful scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed, and those involved may face FBI investigation. The plot, orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to discredit Mueller and his investigation. Wohl, a 20-year-old Trump supporter, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, allegedly offered money to women to make false claims against Mueller. Their plan was thin and easily debunked, but it managed to deceive some journalists and media outlets, wasting valuable resources just days before the midterm elections. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and Wohl and Burkman may face consequences for their actions. This incident highlights the dangers of spreading false information and the importance of verifying sources before reporting.

END OF SUMMARY.
