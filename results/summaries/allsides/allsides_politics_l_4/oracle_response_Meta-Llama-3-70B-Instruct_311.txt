SUMMARY:

A suspected attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed, and may lead to legal consequences for those involved. The plot, which appears to be a smear campaign, was orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. They allegedly offered money to women to make false claims against Mueller, in a bid to discredit him and his investigation. The scheme was amateurish and easily debunked, with Wohl's involvement exposed through his own tweets and Burkman's claims of a "real company" called Surefire Intelligence, which turned out to be a one-man operation. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and Mueller's office has referred the allegations to them. The incident has sparked outrage, with many criticizing the attempt to steal the spotlight and change the subject just days before the midterm elections. The episode has also raised questions about the ethics of certain media outlets, which devoted resources to covering the false allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
