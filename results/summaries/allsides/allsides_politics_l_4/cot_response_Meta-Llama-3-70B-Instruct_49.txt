SUMMARY:
A suspected plot to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller by fabricating sexual misconduct allegations has been exposed. The scheme, orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, involved offering women money to make false claims. The plan was embarrassingly thin and quickly unraveled, with Mueller's office referring the matter to the FBI for investigation. Wohl, known for his sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and dubious claims, appears to have been involved in a scam to troll the media and smear Mueller. Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have been tricked or was a willing participant. The debacle has sparked mockery and raised questions about the use of scarce journalistic resources to debunk such nonsense. The FBI is now investigating the matter. END OF SUMMARY.
