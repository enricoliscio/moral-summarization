SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been uncovered and referred to the FBI for investigation. Conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman appear to be involved in the plot, which was first hinted at by Wohl on Twitter. The scheme, carried out through a shady private intelligence company called Surefire Intelligence, involved offering money to women to make false claims about Mueller. However, internet sleuths quickly exposed the scam, revealing that Surefire Intelligence was likely a front for Wohl. Despite the debunking, the far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller before taking it down. Mueller's office has referred the matter to the FBI, and it remains to be seen if the scheme was just trolling or a malicious attempt to smear Mueller's reputation. Burkman continues to claim that he will reveal Mueller's "victims," but his press conferences have a history of being duds. The incident has raised concerns about the use of scarce journalistic resources to debunk such scams, especially in the crucial days leading up to the midterm elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
