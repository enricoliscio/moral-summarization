Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It mentions that Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI. 

There are two main people involved: Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl is a conservative Twitter personality known for supporting Trump and running shady hedge funds. Burkman is a Republican lobbyist with a history of making false claims. They seem to be involved in a scheme to drum up these fake allegations.

The article describes how the plot unfolded, with Wohl and Burkman possibly trying to trick journalists or troll the media. The key points are that the scheme was thin and involved a fake company called Surefire Intelligence. The attempt backfired, leading to public exposure and FBI involvement.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main actors, the nature of the scheme, the involvement of the FBI, and the outcome. I should make sure to mention that the plot was a failure and that media outlets ended up covering it, which might have been part of the plan to distract.

Let me structure this: Start with the attempt to create fake allegations, mention Mueller's office referring it to the FBI. Then introduce Wohl and Burkman, their backgrounds, and their roles in the scheme. Highlight the use of Surefire Intelligence as a fake company, the document released by Gateway Pundit, and the FBI's involvement. Conclude with the impact on media coverage and the potential backfiring of the scheme.

I should keep each sentence concise and avoid unnecessary details. Make sure it's clear that the attempt was unsuccessful and that the individuals involved might face consequences. Also, note that the media's coverage might have been part of the plan to divert attention.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary without exceeding the word limit. I'll make sure to include all key points succinctly.

SUMMARY: A scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has unraveled, potentially implicating conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Mueller’s office referred the matter to the FBI after learning of the alleged plot. Wohl, a Trump supporter known for dubious claims, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were reportedly involved in an attempt to create false accusations, possibly through a fake company, Surefire Intelligence. The scheme backfired when details emerged, leading to public exposure and FBI investigation. Media outlets covered the story, which may have been intended to distract from other issues. Burkman claims to have evidence of Mueller’s victims, but past claims by him have been discredited. The plot appears to have failed, with Wohl potentially facing scrutiny. END OF SUMMARY.
