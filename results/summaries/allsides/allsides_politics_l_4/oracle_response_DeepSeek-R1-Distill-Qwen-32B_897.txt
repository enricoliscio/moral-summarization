SUMMARY: A plot to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller was uncovered, involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. The scheme allegedly involved offering money to women to make false claims, which was referred to the FBI for investigation. Wohl, known for his pro-Trump tweets and shady dealings, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were implicated in the operation. The plan appeared to be a smear attempt, with journalists reacting with alarm and debunking the claims. The "private intelligence company" Surefire was revealed to be a scam, with Wohl potentially tricking Burkman or trolling the media. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller before removing it. Muellerâ€™s office confirmed the FBI is investigating. The scam may have succeeded in diverting media attention, but its credibility was questioned, and Burkman continues to promise a press conference. The incident highlights the risks of spreading false allegations and the potential consequences for those involved. END OF SUMMARY.
