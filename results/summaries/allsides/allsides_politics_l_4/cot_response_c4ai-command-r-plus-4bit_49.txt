SUMMARY:
An apparent and disgraceful attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller collapsed spectacularly. The plot may have landed some conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. Mueller's spokesperson said that they immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation when they learned of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims. Exactly what was going on remains unclear, including the object of the apparent scheme. 

The plot spilled into public view after pro-Trump Twitter personality Jacob Wohl made ominous suggestions about upcoming allegations. Journalists reacted with alarm, suspecting a shady operation and an embarrassingly thin scam. Internet sleuths dug into Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations. Wohl was publicly cagey about his involvement, while Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman freely admitted his connection to Wohl and the company. However, it appears that Surefire Intelligence was a front for Wohl, who may have been the sole operator. 

Despite the thin disguise, the far-right website Gateway Pundit published a heavily redacted document alleging rape by Mueller. The document was later removed amid Twitter mockery, and the website claimed to be "looking into" allegations against Wohl. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and Wohl may end up as the ultimate loser if found culpable. However, if the purpose of the scam was to troll journalists and divert attention from the Mueller investigation, it could be considered a twisted success. By responding to and debunking the allegations, journalists devoted scarce resources to this nonsensical story just days before the midterm elections. Burkman continues to claim he will reveal Mueller's "victims," but his press conferences have a history of being duds. If the goal was to steal the spotlight and change the subject, the plan succeeded.
END OF SUMMARY.
