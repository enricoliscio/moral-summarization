SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller with false sexual misconduct allegations was exposed and referred to the FBI. Jacob Wohl, a conservative activist known for his sycophantic support of President Trump and dubious claims, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, appear to be involved. The plot was revealed when Wohl and Burkman, or both, may have tried to drum up these allegations against Mueller. The whole scheme fell apart when journalists and online researchers exposed that a supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations, Surefire Intelligence, was likely a front for Wohl. Despite the scam being uncovered, far-right websites still posted heavily redacted documents making the false allegations, causing Mueller's office to issue a statement referring the matter to the FBI. While the ultimate motive and participants in the scheme are still unclear, the incident highlights the dangers of false accusations and the potential for trolls to manipulate media coverage. Burkman still plans to hold a press conference on Thursday, claiming to reveal "the first" of Mueller's victims.
END OF SUMMARY.
