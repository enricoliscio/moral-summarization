SUMMARY: A scheme to fabricate false sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller has unraveled, potentially implicating conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a pro-Trump social media personality, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist, were reportedly involved in an operation to create a fake investigation through a company called Surefire Intelligence. The plan appeared to involve offering money to women to make false claims against Mueller. The scheme came to light after Wohl hinted at an upcoming story, prompting journalists to investigate and expose its thin nature. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, and Wohl's website, Gateway Pundit, briefly posted a redacted document with a rape allegation before removing it. The operation, if proven, would constitute an unethical attempt to smear Mueller and manipulate media coverage, particularly ahead of the midterm elections. Burkman continues to claim he will reveal Mueller's alleged victims, though his credibility is questionable. The incident highlights the potential for misuse of media and the risks of spreading false information. END OF SUMMARY.
