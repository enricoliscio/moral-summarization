Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and an example response, so I should follow that structure. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. The plot seems to have backfired, and the FBI is now involved.

I should highlight the key players: Wohl, Burkman, and Mueller's spokesperson. The article mentions that the scheme was thin and caused public embarrassment. Media outlets covered it, which might have been the trolls' goal to distract.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it's concise. Also, the moral framing should be clear, showing the unethical nature of the attempt and the consequences.

Let me structure the summary: start with the collapse of the scheme, mention the individuals involved, the FBI's involvement, the media's reaction, and the potential impact on Mueller's investigation. Conclude with the moral implication of using fake allegations to distract.

I should avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Make sure to include that the attempt was unethical and the potential fallout for those involved. Also, note how the media coverage might have been part of the plan to divert attention.

Double-checking the word count to ensure it's within limits. Make sure all key points are covered without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: A plot to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has unraveled, potentially implicating conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI after learning of the scheme, which involved offering money to women to make false claims. Wohl, a pro-Trump figure, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were linked to the operation, which appears to have been a poorly conceived attempt to smear Mueller. The plan backfired, with Wohl's connections to a fake intelligence company, Surefire, being exposed. Media outlets, including major news organizations, covered the story, inadvertently giving it attention. Burkman continues to promise revelations, but his credibility is questionable. The scheme, if proven, reflects unethical attempts to manipulate public perception and divert attention from Mueller's work. END OF SUMMARY.
