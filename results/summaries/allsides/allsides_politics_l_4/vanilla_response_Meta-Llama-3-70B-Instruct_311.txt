SUMMARY:

An apparent attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has failed, and may have landed conservative activists in trouble with the FBI. The scheme involved Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist. They allegedly offered women money to make false claims about Mueller. The plot was exposed after Wohl hinted at the allegations on Twitter, and journalists reacted with alarm. The FBI is now investigating the matter. The supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, behind the allegations appears to be a fake entity created by Wohl. A heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller was briefly posted on the far-right website Gateway Pundit, but was taken down after Twitter mockery. Mueller's office has referred the allegations to the FBI for investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
