Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a scheme involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman trying to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller. The key morally charged words are things like "offered," "claims," "scheme," "smear," "plot," "scam," etc. I should make sure to include these terms in the summary.

I'll start by identifying the main actors: Wohl and Burkman. They're involved in a plot to drum up false allegations, which is a smear attempt. The article mentions that Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, so I'll note that. It's important to highlight that the scheme was thin and caused public embarrassment.

I should also mention how the media reacted, debunking the claims and diverting resources away from other important topics, especially near the midterm elections. This shows the impact of the scam beyond just the individuals involved.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the plot, the individuals involved, the FBI's involvement, the media's reaction, and the potential consequences. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the plot, moving to the individuals, the FBI's action, the media's role, and the outcome. This should cover all necessary points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
A morally questionable scheme emerged as conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman were allegedly involved in an attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller. The plot, described as a smear attempt, reportedly involved offering money to women to make false claims. Mueller’s office referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. Wohl, a pro-Trump figure known for dubious claims, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were central to the scheme. The operation, which appeared to be a scam, aimed to trick journalists and divert attention from Mueller’s work. The FBI is now investigating, and the media, including major outlets, debunked the claims, diverting resources from other critical issues ahead of the midterm elections. Burkman continues to promise a press conference, but past claims have been discredited. The scheme, if proven, could land the activists in hot water, while Wohl may face consequences for his role in the scam. The attempt to change the subject and steal the spotlight succeeded in making news, even if it was nonsense. END OF SUMMARY.
