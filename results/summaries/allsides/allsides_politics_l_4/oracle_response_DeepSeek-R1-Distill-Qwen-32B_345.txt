Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to get a good grasp of what's happening.

The article talks about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It seems like conservative activists, including Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, were involved in this scheme. Wohl is known for his pro-Trump tweets and shady business dealings, while Burkman is a lobbyist with a history of making false claims. They tried to set up a fake investigation through a company called Surefire Intelligence, which turned out to be just Wohl's operation.

The key points are that they offered money to women to make false claims, which was referred to the FBI. The article uses words like "drum," "allegations," "plot," "scam," and "smear," which are all morally charged. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral framing.

I should structure the summary to include the main actors, their actions, the involvement of the FBI, and the implications of the scheme. Also, the article mentions how the media's attention was diverted, which is another moral aspect because it's about wasting resources.

I'll start by stating the attempt to drum up fake allegations, mention Mueller's office referring it to the FBI, and then detail who was involved. I'll explain the scam, the role of Surefire, and the consequences for the individuals involved. I'll also touch on how the media's coverage, even in debunking the claims, might have had unintended effects.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and use as many of the listed moral words as possible. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary elements without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: An apparent attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has been exposed, potentially landing conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. Mueller’s office referred the matter to the FBI after learning of claims that women were offered money to make false allegations. The operation involved Jacob Wohl, a pro-Trump figure with a history of dubious claims, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist known for false claims. The scheme, described as a scam, aimed to smear Mueller by creating a fake investigation through a company called Surefire Intelligence, which appears to be a front for Wohl. Burkman claimed Surefire was real, but it turned out to be a sham. The plot unraveled when Gateway Pundit published a redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, sparking widespread mockery. Mueller’s office debunked the claims, but the operation succeeded in diverting media attention, potentially stealing the spotlight and wasting journalistic resources. The FBI is now investigating, and Burkman continues to promise a press conference, though past claims have been discredited. The attempt to smear Mueller may have backfired, but its impact on the media and public perception remains significant. END OF SUMMARY.
