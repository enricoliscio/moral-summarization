SUMMARY: An attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller was exposed and referred to the FBI. Conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman were suspected of orchestrating the plot, which involved a fake private intelligence company called Surefire Intelligence. Despite the thinly veiled scam, the far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly published a redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller before taking it down. The incident caused several media outlets to devote resources to debunking the claims, potentially diverting attention from more pressing issues ahead of the midterm elections. While the FBI investigation is ongoing, the incident highlights the lengths to which some will go to discredit Mueller and his investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
