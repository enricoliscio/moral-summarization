SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed and referred to the FBI. The plot, orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, was an attempt to smear Mueller and the investigation or to troll journalists. The scheme fell apart when journalists and online researchers discovered that the supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations, Surefire Intelligence, was actually just Jacob Wohl. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but it was quickly taken down amid Twitter mockery. Mueller's office has referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. While the scam may have succeeded in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject ahead of the midterm elections, Wohl may ultimately be the loser if the FBI finds him complicit in the plot.
END OF SUMMARY.
