Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an attempt to create false sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller. Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman are involved, and the FBI is investigating. The article describes the plot, the individuals involved, and the impact on media and public perception.

I should highlight the key elements: the attempt to drum up false claims, the offer of money, the investigation by the FBI, the operation by Wohl and Burkman, the plot's scam nature, the smear attempt, and the media's role in debunking it. Also, mention how the plan succeeded in diverting attention.

Now, I'll structure the summary, using the morally charged words. Start with the main event, mention the individuals, describe the scam, the FBI involvement, and the media's reaction. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

I need to ensure that the summary flows naturally while including the required terms. Avoid jargon and keep it clear. Make sure each sentence contributes to the overall moral framing without unnecessary details.

Let me draft it step by step, checking each sentence for the inclusion of the key words and ensuring the summary stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: An apparent attempt to drum up false sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has been exposed, potentially involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a pro-Trump Twitter personality, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist, were linked to a shady operation aiming to smear Mueller by offering money to women to make false claims. Mueller’s spokesperson referred the matter to the FBI for investigation, calling the scheme a scam. Wohl and Burkman’s involvement remains unclear, with Burkman insisting Surefire Intelligence, a company linked to the plot, was real, while Wohl was cagey about his role. The plan, which included a redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, backfired, leading to widespread mockery and media debunking. The operation may have succeeded in diverting attention and stealing the spotlight, with Burkman still promising to reveal Mueller’s alleged victims. The FBI is now investigating, and Wohl may face consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
