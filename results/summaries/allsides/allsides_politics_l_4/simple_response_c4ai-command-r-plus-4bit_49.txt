SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin and morally bankrupt scam to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller with false sexual misconduct allegations was exposed and referred to the FBI. Conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman appear to be involved in the plot, either willingly or with Wohl tricking Burkman. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but took it down amid scrutiny and backlash. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, and the potential consequences for those involved remain uncertain. While the scam may have succeeded in trolling journalists and diverting attention, it also wasted valuable journalistic resources ahead of the midterm elections. Burkman insists he will reveal Mueller's "victims" at a press conference, despite his history of false claims. This incident highlights the dangerous and unethical lengths some will go to spread misinformation and discredit legitimate investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
