SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller with phony sexual misconduct allegations collapsed on Tuesday and is now under FBI investigation. The plot, orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, involved attempting to drum up false accusations against Mueller. Wohl, a pro-Trump personality known for his sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and dubious claims, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have been trolling the media or each other. The scheme fell apart when journalists and online researchers exposed the supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations, Surefire Intelligence, as a sham operated solely by Wohl. Despite the far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posting a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, the scam was widely mocked and discredited. The incident highlights the willingness of some to engage in deceptive and unethical tactics to discredit political opponents, and the potential impact of such tactics on media narratives and public discourse. 

END OF SUMMARY.
