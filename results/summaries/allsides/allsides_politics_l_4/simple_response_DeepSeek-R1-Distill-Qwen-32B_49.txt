Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, the article is about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It mentions that this scheme was uncovered and may involve conservative activists. Mueller's spokesperson said they referred the matter to the FBI. 

The key players are Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl is a young conservative known for supporting Trump and running shady hedge funds. Burkman is a lobbyist with a history of making false claims. The article suggests that they were involved in a plot to drum up these false allegations, possibly as a smear campaign.

The scheme involved a fake private intelligence company called Surefire Intelligence, which seems to be a front for Wohl. The article also mentions a document with a rape allegation against Mueller, which was taken down after public scrutiny. The media coverage, even while debunking the claims, might have diverted attention away from other important issues, especially with the midterm elections approaching.

I need to make sure the summary includes the main elements: who was involved, what the scheme was, the involvement of the FBI, and the implications regarding media attention and potential diversion from important topics. Also, the moral framing is important, so I should highlight the unethical nature of creating fake allegations and the potential impact on public discourse.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. Let me structure it by introducing the scheme, the individuals involved, the role of Surefire, the media's reaction, and the consequences.

I also need to avoid any markdown and just provide a clear, straightforward summary. Let me check if I have all the key points: Mueller's office referring to the FBI, the individuals' backgrounds, the fake company, the document, media coverage, and the timing around the elections.

I think that covers it. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: A scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller appears to have unraveled, involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a Trump supporter known for dubious claims, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were linked to a plot to create false accusations, possibly through a fake intelligence company, Surefire. The scheme, which included a redacted document alleging rape against Mueller, was exposed after journalists and online sleuths uncovered its flaws. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, while Wohl's website, Gateway Pundit, retracted the document amid scrutiny. The incident highlights the unethical attempt to smear Mueller and divert media attention, with Burkman still promising to reveal "victims." The scheme may have succeeded in drawing media coverage, even as it was debunked, potentially distracting from critical issues ahead of the midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
