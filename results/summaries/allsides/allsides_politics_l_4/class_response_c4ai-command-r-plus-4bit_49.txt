SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller was foiled on Tuesday. The plot, orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, involved attempting to pay women to make false claims about Mueller. The scheme was quickly uncovered by journalists and internet sleuths, who exposed the fake private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, that was supposedly investigating the allegations. Despite the thin veneer of legitimacy, it appeared that Surefire Intelligence was just Jacob Wohl. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller, but quickly took it down amid widespread skepticism and mockery. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI for investigation, and the plotters may now face consequences for their attempt to smear Mueller. This incident highlights the lengths to which some will go to undermine legitimate investigations through deceitful tactics.
END OF SUMMARY.
