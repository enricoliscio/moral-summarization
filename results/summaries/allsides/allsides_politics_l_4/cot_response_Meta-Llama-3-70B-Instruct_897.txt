SUMMARY:
A suspicious scheme to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller by fabricating sexual misconduct allegations has been exposed. The plot, orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, involved offering women money to make false claims. The scandalous attempt was embarrassingly thin and quickly unraveled, landing the perpetrators in hot water with the FBI. Wohl, known for his sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and dubious claims, was involved in a shady hedge fund and appears to have tricked Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, into participating in the scam. The far-right website Gateway Pundit initially posted a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but later took it down after facing Twitter mockery. The FBI is now investigating the serious allegations. The whole ordeal is a prime example of how trolls can succeed in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject, even if their claims are eventually debunked. END OF SUMMARY.
