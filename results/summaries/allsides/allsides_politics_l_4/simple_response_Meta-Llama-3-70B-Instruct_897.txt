SUMMARY:

A scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed, and it may have landed conservative activists in trouble with the FBI. The plot, which appears to be a smear attempt, involved Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist. They allegedly offered money to women to make false claims about Mueller. The scheme was thinly veiled and easily debunked, but it still managed to garner attention from major media outlets, diverting resources from more important topics just days before the midterm elections. The FBI is now investigating the matter. The incident highlights the dangers of spreading misinformation and the importance of verifying sources. It also raises questions about the intentions and ethics of those involved, who seem more interested in trolling journalists and smearing Mueller than in uncovering the truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
