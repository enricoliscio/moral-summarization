SUMMARY: An attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman fell apart on Tuesday and is now under FBI investigation. Wohl, a pro-Trump personality known for dubious claims, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have been involved in a plot to discredit Mueller. The scheme was exposed when Wohl and Burkman's supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, was found to be a sham, with evidence suggesting it was solely operated by Wohl. Despite the thinly veiled scam, the far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document with rape allegations against Mueller, only to later retract it. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, and the incident has highlighted the potential impact of such schemes on media resources and public discourse. Burkman still plans to hold a press conference on Thursday, claiming to reveal Mueller's "victims," but his past press conferences have been unreliable. The incident underscores the potential influence of trolls and conspiracy theorists in shaping public discourse, even if their schemes are ultimately debunked.
END OF SUMMARY.
