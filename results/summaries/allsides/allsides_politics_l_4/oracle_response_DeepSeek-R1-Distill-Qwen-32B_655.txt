Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully. It's about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. The key players are Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. 

The article mentions that Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI. There are terms like "drum up," "phony allegations," "offered money," "false claims," "plot," "scam," "smear," "debunk," and "steal" which are morally charged. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to first state the main event: the failed attempt to create fake allegations. Then mention the individuals involved, Wohl and Burkman, and their backgrounds. Highlight the involvement of the FBI and the media's reaction, noting how the media's coverage might have been manipulated. Conclude with the current status and the potential consequences.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all the morally framed words are included without losing the essence of the article. Let me draft the summary, making sure each key point is covered and the moral terms are preserved.

SUMMARY: An attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has unraveled, potentially implicating conservative activists in an FBI investigation. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI after learning of claims that women were offered money to make false allegations. The operation involved Jacob Wohl, a conservative Twitter personality known for implausible claims, and Jack Burkman, a conspiracy theorist. The plot, which appears to be a scam, aimed to smear Mueller by creating false claims through a fake intelligence company, Surefire. Journalists and online sleuths exposed the scheme, leading to the removal of a redacted document from the far-right website Gateway Pundit. The attempt succeeded in making news and diverting media attention, though its true intent remains unclear. Burkman still claims to reveal Mueller's victims, but previous press conferences have been duds. The FBI is now investigating, and Wohl may face consequences. The operation, if proven, could be seen as an attempt to steal the spotlight and manipulate media coverage. END OF SUMMARY.
