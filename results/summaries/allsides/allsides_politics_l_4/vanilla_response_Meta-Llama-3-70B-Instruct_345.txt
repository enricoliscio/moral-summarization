SUMMARY:

A suspected scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed. The plot, which may have involved conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to discredit Mueller and his investigation. Wohl, a 20-year-old Trump supporter, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have offered women money to make false claims against Mueller. The scheme was revealed after Wohl hinted at a forthcoming story on Twitter, prompting journalists to investigate. The supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, behind the allegations appears to be a fake entity created by Wohl. The FBI is now investigating the matter. Despite the apparent scam, several media outlets devoted resources to debunking the claims, potentially distracting from more important news ahead of the midterm elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
