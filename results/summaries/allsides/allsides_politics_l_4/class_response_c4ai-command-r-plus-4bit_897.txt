SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed and referred to the FBI. Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative known for his sycophantic replies to President Trump's tweets and dubious claims, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, appear to be the key figures behind this plot. Wohl and Burkman may have been trolling the media or specifically targeting Mueller, or Wohl may have been tricking Burkman. Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations, seems to be a front for Wohl. Despite the thin evidence and questions about the legitimacy of the operation, the far-right website Gateway Pundit published a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller. The document was later taken down, and the matter has been referred to the FBI for investigation. While the ultimate motive behind the scheme remains unclear, it diverted journalistic resources and attention just days before the midterm elections. Burkman still insists he will reveal Mueller's "victims" at a press conference on Thursday.
END OF SUMMARY.
