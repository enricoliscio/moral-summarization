SUMMARY:

A suspicious scheme to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller was exposed, and it may have landed conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The plot, which appears to be a smear attempt, involved Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist. They allegedly offered women money to make false claims about Mueller, but the plan was embarrassingly thin and quickly unraveled. The supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, was revealed to be essentially a one-man show run by Wohl, who was publicly cagey about his involvement. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and if found guilty, Wohl and Burkman may face consequences. The episode also highlights how trolls can successfully steal the spotlight and change the subject, diverting scarce journalistic resources from more important topics.

END OF SUMMARY.
