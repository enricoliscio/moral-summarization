Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman are involved. Wohl is a conservative Twitter personality known for supporting Trump and running shady hedge funds. Burkman is a Republican lobbyist with a history of making false claims. They were involved in a scheme to drum up these allegations, possibly through a fake intelligence company called Surefire. The plan backfired when details leaked, leading to FBI involvement. The article mentions that the attempt was a smear, a scam, and involved tricking people. Media outlets ended up debunking the claims, which diverted attention from other issues, especially before the midterm elections.

I need to include the morally framed words: offered, claims, investigation, scheme, smear, attempt, sending, murdered, harassment, plot, drum, tricking, scam, told, redacted, rape, troll, debunk, devoted, steal, change.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects, using these words where appropriate. I'll start by stating the attempt, mention the individuals involved, the scheme, the smear, the FBI investigation, and the media's role in debunking it. I'll also note the impact on diverting attention.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: An apparent attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, unfolded, involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. The scheme, which aimed to smear Mueller, involved offering money to women to make false claims. Wohl, known for his pro-Trump tweets and shady dealings, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist with a history of false claims, were central to the plot. The plan, which included a fake intelligence company, Surefire, backfired when details leaked, prompting an FBI investigation. Media outlets, including the New York Times and BuzzFeed, debunked the claims, diverting attention from other issues ahead of the midterm elections. The attempt, described as a scam and troll, succeeded in creating a stir but may have backfired for those involved. END OF SUMMARY.
