Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It mentions that this scheme was uncovered, and the FBI is now involved. Mueller's spokesperson made a statement about referring the matter to the FBI.

Key players include Jacob Wohl, a pro-Trump Twitter personality, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist. They were involved in a plot to drum up these false claims. The article describes how the plan unfolded, with Wohl and Burkman possibly trying to trick journalists or the media into covering their fake story.

The article also mentions that a far-right website, Gateway Pundit, posted a redacted document with a rape allegation against Mueller, but they later took it down. The media, including major outlets, covered this story, which the article suggests might have been the goal of the schemeâ€”to divert attention and use up journalistic resources before the midterm elections.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the fake allegations, the individuals involved, the FBI's involvement, and the media's reaction. I should make sure to mention that the scheme backfired and that the media's coverage might have been part of the plan.

Let me structure it step by step: start with the attempt to create fake allegations, mention Wohl and Burkman, the FBI's involvement, the media's reaction, and the potential impact on Mueller's investigation.

I should also note that the scheme was thin and that the media's coverage might have been the goal, even if it backfired. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: An attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has unraveled, involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a pro-Trump figure, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were linked to a scheme to create false claims, possibly to smear Mueller. The plot emerged when Wohl hinted at an upcoming story, prompting journalists to investigate. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI. The scheme involved a fake company, Surefire Intelligence, which appeared to be a sham. A far-right website, Gateway Pundit, briefly posted a redacted document alleging rape against Mueller before removing it. Media outlets covered the story, which may have been intended to distract from Mueller's work and divert attention. Burkman continues to claim he will reveal Mueller's alleged victims, though past claims have been unfounded. The FBI is now investigating the matter. END OF SUMMARY.
