Alright, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They've specified to use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes those terms.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller. Key players are Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, who are involved in a scheme. The article mentions the FBI being involved, the use of a fake company called Surefire Intelligence, and the impact on media coverage.

I should identify the morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "offered," "scheme," "smear," "plot," "scam," "trick," "rape," "troll," "debunk," "devoted," "steal," and "change" are crucial. I need to incorporate these into the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by outlining the main events: the attempt to create false claims, the individuals involved, the FBI's involvement, the use of Surefire, the redacted document, and the media's response. I'll make sure to highlight the moral implications, like the smear attempt, the scam, and the trolling of media.

I should also mention the consequences, such as the media resources being diverted and the potential impact on the midterm elections. Ending with the ongoing FBI investigation ties it all together.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the key moral terms. I'll check each sentence to make sure it's concise and captures the essence of the article while preserving the author's moral framing.

SUMMARY: An apparent scheme to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has unraveled, potentially implicating conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a pro-Trump figure, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist, were allegedly involved in a plot to offer money to women to make false claims against Mueller. The scheme, described as a smear attempt, was exposed when Wohl hinted at a story about such allegations, prompting journalists to react with alarm. The operation involved a fake company, Surefire Intelligence, which appears to be a scam orchestrated by Wohl. Burkman, who claimed Surefire was "real," may have been tricked or willingly participated. The FBI is investigating after Mueller’s office referred the matter. A redacted document with a rape allegation against Mueller was briefly posted by a far-right website, but it was later removed. The attempt to troll the media succeeded in diverting journalistic resources, with outlets devoting coverage to debunk the claims. Burkman continues to promise a press conference, but it may end in a dud. The FBI’s investigation remains ongoing. END OF SUMMARY.
