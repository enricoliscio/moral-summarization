SUMMARY:

A suspected attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed, and may have landed conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The plot, which appears to be a smear attempt, involved Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist. They may have offered women money to make false claims about Mueller, and created a fake private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, to convince journalists of the allegations. However, their operation was embarrassingly thin and easily debunked by internet sleuths. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and Wohl may end up being the ultimate loser. The scam's success, however, lies in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject, as many media outlets devoted resources to debunking the claims, just days before the midterm elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
