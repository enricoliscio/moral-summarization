SUMMARY:

A brazen attempt to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller spectacularly backfired, and may have landed conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The apparent scheme, which reeked of desperation, involved making false claims and offering women money to smear Mueller. The key players, Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, have a history of making implausible and factually dubious claims. Wohl's involvement in the plot is unclear, but Burkman freely admitted that the supposed private intelligence company, Surefire, was run by Wohl. However, internet sleuths uncovered that Surefire was essentially a one-man show, with Wohl using different voices to convince prosecutors of his client's innocence. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and if found guilty, Wohl and Burkman may face consequences. The whole ordeal has wasted scarce journalistic resources, and may have succeeded in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject just days before the midterm elections.

END OF SUMMARY.
