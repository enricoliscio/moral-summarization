SUMMARY:

A plot to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller appears to have been foiled. The scheme, allegedly involving conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to offer women money to make false claims against Mueller. The plan was exposed on Twitter, and Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. Wohl and Burkman's involvement is unclear, with Wohl being cagey about his role and Burkman claiming that Surefire Intelligence, a supposed private intelligence company, was "real" and run by Wohl. However, online sleuths discovered that Surefire appeared to be a one-man operation run by Wohl. The Gateway Pundit website posted a redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but later took it down. The FBI is now investigating the matter. If the goal was to troll journalists and smear Mueller, it may have succeeded in diverting journalistic resources from other topics.

END OF SUMMARY.
