SUMMARY: An attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman fell apart on Tuesday and is now under FBI investigation. Wohl, a pro-Trump personality known for dubious claims, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have been involved in a plot to drum up allegations against Mueller. The scheme was exposed when Wohl and Burkman's supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, was revealed to be a sham, with internet sleuths uncovering that it was solely run by Wohl. Despite this, the far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller before taking it down. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, and the incident has sparked media coverage, potentially diverting resources away from more pressing topics ahead of the midterm elections. While the true extent of the plot remains unclear, the incident has drawn attention and scrutiny, with the FBI now investigating.
END OF SUMMARY.
