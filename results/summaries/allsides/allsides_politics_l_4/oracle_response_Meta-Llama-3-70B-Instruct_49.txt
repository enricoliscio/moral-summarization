SUMMARY:

A deceitful attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller spectacularly failed, and may have landed conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The plot, involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to drum up phony claims and smear Mueller's reputation. Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, has a history of making implausible and factually dubious claims. Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, has repeatedly made false claims. The operation involved offering money to women to make false allegations, which was promptly referred to the FBI for investigation. The scam was embarrassingly thin, and internet sleuths quickly uncovered the truth, revealing that Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company, was essentially a one-man show run by Wohl. The FBI is now investigating the matter, and Wohl may face consequences for his actions. The incident highlights the dangers of attempting to deceive and manipulate the media and the public.
