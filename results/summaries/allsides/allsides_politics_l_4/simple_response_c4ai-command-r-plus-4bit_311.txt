SUMMARY: A pathetically thin plot to falsely accuse Special Counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct was exposed and spectacularly collapsed on Tuesday. Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative known for his sycophantic replies to President Trump's tweets and dubious claims, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, appear to be the key figures behind the scheme. Wohl and Burkman may have been involved in the plot, or they may have been trolling the media. The whole matter spilled into public view after Wohl hinted at an upcoming story, leading journalists to uncover the scam. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller, but later took it down amid scrutiny and backlash. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. While the attempt to smear Mueller failed, it diverted journalistic attention and resources just days before the midterm elections. Burkman insists he will hold a press conference on Thursday to reveal "the first" of Mueller's alleged victims, but his track record casts doubt on the legitimacy of these claims.

END OF SUMMARY.
