SUMMARY:

A suspicious attempt to smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller with phony sexual misconduct allegations has been exposed, and the FBI is now investigating. The plot, which appears to be a scam, involved offering women money to make false claims against Mueller. The key players behind this scheme are Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist. Wohl, known for sending sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and making dubious claims, may have been involved in drumming up these allegations. Burkman, who has a history of making false claims, insisted that the private intelligence company, Surefire, was real, but it seems to be a one-man show run by Wohl. The whole matter spilled into public view, and journalists reacted with alarm, calling it a smear attempt. The FBI is now investigating, and if found guilty, those involved may face consequences. The incident has also raised concerns about the devotion of journalistic resources to debunking such scams, especially with the midterm elections approaching. END OF SUMMARY.
