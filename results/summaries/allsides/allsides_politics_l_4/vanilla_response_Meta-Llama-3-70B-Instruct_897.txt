SUMMARY:

An apparent attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has collapsed. The scheme, which may have involved conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to pay women to make false claims against Mueller. The plot was exposed after Wohl hinted at a forthcoming story on Twitter, prompting journalists to investigate. The supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, behind the allegations was found to be likely a one-man operation by Wohl. A heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller was posted on the far-right website Gateway Pundit, but was later taken down. Mueller's office has referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. The incident has sparked concerns about the spread of misinformation and the wasting of journalistic resources on debunking false claims.

END OF SUMMARY.
