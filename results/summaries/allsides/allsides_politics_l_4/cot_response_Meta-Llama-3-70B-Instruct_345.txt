SUMMARY:
A suspicious attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed, and it may have landed conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The scheme, which appears to be a "shady" and "thin" scam, involved offering money to women to make false claims against Mueller. The key players, Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, have a history of making "implausible" and "dubious" claims. Wohl's involvement in the plot is unclear, but Burkman freely admitted that Surefire Intelligence, the supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations, is run by Wohl. The whole matter was "embarrassingly" exposed, and the FBI is now investigating. The incident has been met with "mockery" on Twitter, and Mueller's office has referred the allegations to the FBI. The "far-right" website Gateway Pundit initially posted a document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but later took it down. The incident has "succeeded" in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject, but it remains to be seen what the FBI will find. END OF SUMMARY.
