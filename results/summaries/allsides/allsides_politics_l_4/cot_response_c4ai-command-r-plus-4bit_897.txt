SUMMARY: 
An apparent attempt to fabricate phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed and referred to the FBI. The plot, which involved conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, was characterized by shady tactics and caused alarm among journalists. Wohl, known for his dubious claims and speedy replies to Trump's tweets, and Burkman, a conspiracy theorist with a history of false claims, may have been trolling or orchestrating a scam. The scheme was embarrassingly thin, and internet sleuths quickly uncovered ties to a questionable private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence. While Burkman claimed the company was real, it appeared to be a front for Wohl's deceptive activities. Despite the red flags, the far-right conspiracist website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller. The document was later removed amid concerns about Wohl's involvement. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, and the plot ultimately backfired, wasting journalistic resources and stealing attention days before the midterm elections. While the true extent of the deception remains unclear, the attempt to smear Mueller and derail the investigation failed, and those involved may face serious consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
