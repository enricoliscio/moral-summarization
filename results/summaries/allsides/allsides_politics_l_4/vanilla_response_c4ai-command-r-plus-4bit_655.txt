SUMMARY: An attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed, potentially implicating conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman in illegal activity. Wohl, known for his sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, were suspected of orchestrating the plot. The scheme involved a private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, which was allegedly run solely by Wohl. Despite their efforts, the plan fell apart, with Wohl possibly tricking Burkman or being a willing participant. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document with rape allegations against Mueller but later retracted it. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. While the motive behind the scam remains unclear, it drew attention from several media outlets, potentially diverting resources from more critical topics ahead of the midterm elections. The FBI investigation into the false allegations could have legal consequences for those involved.
END OF SUMMARY.
