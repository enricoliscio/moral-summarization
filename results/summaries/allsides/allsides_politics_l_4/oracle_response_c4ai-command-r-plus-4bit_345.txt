SUMMARY: Conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman appear to have been involved in a plot to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Wohl, a pro-Trump personality known for his dubious claims, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have been trying to smear Mueller or troll the media. The scheme was exposed when Wohl and Burkman's involvement in a supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, was uncovered. It appeared that Surefire Intelligence was a fake company run solely by Wohl. Despite the thin scam, the far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller before taking it down. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI for investigation, and the media has since devoted resources to debunking Wohl and Burkman's claims. Burkman continues to insist that he will reveal Mueller's "victims," but his press conferences have been duds in the past. The attempt to smear Mueller or troll the media may have succeeded in stealing the spotlight and changing the subject ahead of the midterm elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
