SUMMARY:
A spectacularly failed attempt to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller with phony sexual misconduct allegations has landed conservative activists in hot water with the FBI. The scheme, involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, was embarrassingly thin and reeked of desperation. Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative with a history of sycophantic replies to Trump's tweets and making implausible claims, was involved in a plot to drum up false allegations. Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, claimed that Surefire Intelligence, a supposed private intelligence company, was investigating the allegations, but it turned out to be a one-man show run by Wohl. The far-right website Gateway Pundit posted a heavily redacted document making a rape allegation against Mueller, but it was met with mockery on Twitter. The FBI is now investigating the matter. The whole ordeal has been a scam, and Wohl may end up being the ultimate loser. END OF SUMMARY.
