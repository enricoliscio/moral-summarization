SUMMARY:
A suspicious plot to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller with false sexual misconduct allegations has been exposed. The scheme, which appears to be a "shady" and "thin" scam, involves conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a 20-year-old with a history of making "implausible" and "dubious" claims, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and "conspiracy theorist," may have been involved in a plot to offer women money to make false claims against Mueller. The plan was met with "mockery" on Twitter, and the FBI is now investigating. Despite being "debunked," the story has garnered significant media attention, potentially "stealing the spotlight" from more important issues just days before the midterm elections. Mueller's office has referred the matter to the FBI, and it remains to be seen if Wohl will be the "ultimate loser" in this scenario. END OF SUMMARY.
