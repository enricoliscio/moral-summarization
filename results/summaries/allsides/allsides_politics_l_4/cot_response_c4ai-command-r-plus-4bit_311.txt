SUMMARY: An apparent scheme to fabricate phony sexual misconduct allegations against special counsel Robert Mueller was uncovered and referred to the FBI. The plot, orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, was exposed after Wohl made ominous suggestions on Twitter. Wohl and Burkman's history of dubious claims and conspiracy theories raised alarms among journalists and online researchers, who quickly uncovered the thin scam. The supposed private intelligence company investigating the allegations, Surefire Intelligence, was linked back to Wohl. Despite the far-right conspiracist website Gateway Pundit initially posting a redacted document with rape allegations against Mueller, it was later removed due to serious allegations against Wohl. Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI, with the ultimate outcome of the investigation yet to be determined. While Wohl may face consequences, the scam temporarily succeeded in diverting journalistic resources and attention away from more critical topics just days before the midterm elections. Burkman continues to claim that a press conference will reveal Mueller's "victims," despite his history of unsubstantiated claims. END OF SUMMARY.
