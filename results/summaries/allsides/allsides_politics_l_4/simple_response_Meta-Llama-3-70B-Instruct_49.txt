SUMMARY:

A brazen attempt to fabricate sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been exposed, and it may land some conservative activists in trouble with the FBI. The scheme, which appears to be a smear campaign, involved offering women money to make false claims against Mueller. The key players include Jacob Wohl, a 20-year-old conservative with a history of making dubious claims, and Jack Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist. The plot was so thinly veiled that it quickly unraveled, with internet sleuths uncovering the fake private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, which was essentially a one-man operation run by Wohl. The debacle has led to widespread mockery and criticism, with many arguing that the scheme was designed to troll journalists and distract from more important issues. Mueller's office has referred the matter to the FBI for investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
