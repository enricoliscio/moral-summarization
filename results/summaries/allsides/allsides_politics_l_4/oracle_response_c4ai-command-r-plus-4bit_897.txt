SUMMARY: An embarrassingly thin scam to drum up phony sexual misconduct allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been uncovered and referred to the FBI for investigation. The plot, which appears to have been orchestrated by conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, involved offering money to women to make false claims about Mueller. Wohl and Burkman have a history of making dubious claims and spreading conspiracy theories. While the true extent of their involvement in this operation is unclear, it seems that they may have been attempting to troll both the media and Mueller himself. The far-right website Gateway Pundit briefly posted a heavily redacted document making rape allegations against Mueller, but it was quickly taken down amid scrutiny and skepticism. Mueller's office has referred the matter to the FBI, and the potential consequences for those involved remain to be seen. In the meantime, journalists have been forced to devote precious resources to debunking these false allegations just days before the crucial midterm elections. This attempted smear campaign serves as a stark reminder of the lengths some will go to in an attempt to steal the spotlight and manipulate public opinion.
END OF SUMMARY.
