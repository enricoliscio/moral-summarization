Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about an attempt to create fake sexual misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It started with Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, who are conservative activists. They tried to set up a scheme where women would be paid to falsely accuse Mueller. This was exposed when Wohl hinted on Twitter that a story was coming, and journalists reacted with alarm.

The key points are that Mueller's office referred the matter to the FBI. The plot seems to involve a fake company called Surefire Intelligence, which was run by Wohl. The scheme was poorly executed and quickly fell apart, leading to public exposure and media coverage. Burkman claims the company is real, but it's unclear if he was tricked or involved willingly.

The article also mentions that the attempt may have backfired, with Wohl possibly facing consequences from the FBI. Meanwhile, the media coverage might have distracted from other important issues, especially with the midterm elections approaching.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main actors, the nature of the scheme, its exposure, and the implications. I should avoid getting too bogged down in the details and focus on the key events and outcomes.
