SUMMARY:

A brazen attempt to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller by fabricating sexual misconduct allegations has backfired, potentially landing conservative activists in trouble with the FBI. The scheme, allegedly involving Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman, aimed to pay women to make false claims against Mueller. However, the plan was exposed when Wohl hinted at the allegations on Twitter, prompting journalists to investigate and debunk the claims. The "private intelligence company" behind the allegations, Surefire Intelligence, appears to be a sham operation run by Wohl himself. The incident has sparked outrage, with many criticizing the attempt to smear Mueller and the media for devoting resources to the story. Mueller's office has referred the matter to the FBI for investigation. The episode serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of disinformation and the importance of fact-based reporting.
