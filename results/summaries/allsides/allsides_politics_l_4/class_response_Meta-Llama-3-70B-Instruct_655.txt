SUMMARY:

A scheme to smear Special Counsel Robert Mueller with false sexual misconduct allegations has been exposed, and the FBI is now investigating. The plot, which appears to be a scam, involved conservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman. Wohl, a 20-year-old Trump supporter, and Burkman, a Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist, may have offered women money to make false claims against Mueller. The attempt to drum up phony allegations was thwarted when journalists and online researchers discovered that the supposed private intelligence company, Surefire Intelligence, was essentially a one-man operation run by Wohl. The whole matter was then referred to the FBI for investigation. The incident has sparked outrage, with many accusing Wohl and Burkman of trying to troll the media and change the subject just days before the midterm elections. The FBI's investigation will determine the extent of the scheme and whether those involved will face consequences for their actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
