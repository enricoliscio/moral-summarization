SUMMARY:

At a recent rally, President Trump denied Russian collusion, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. Cohen admitted to making six-figure payments to women to buy their silence, and said Trump ordered him to break the law by circumventing the campaign-finance reporting system. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty on eight felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's denial of collusion rings hollow, given his history of lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials to undermine the investigation. His behavior has lent credence to his possible guilt, and his uncontrollable compulsion to lie has set a appalling low example for the presidency. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump himself, who has consistently demonstrated poor character and mendacity.

END OF SUMMARY.
