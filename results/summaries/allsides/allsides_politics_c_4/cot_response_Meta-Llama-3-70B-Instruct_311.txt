SUMMARY:
At a West Virginia rally, President Trump denied Russian collusion, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort being found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's denial is "darn near ancillary" as evidence mounts against him. His behavior, including lying, bullying, and harassing, demonstrates his poor character and unfitness for office. Trump's compulsion to lie and undermine the investigation has lent credence to his possible guilt. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump himself, who has set an appallingly low example for the presidency. His incivility and mendacity have damaged the office, making him a liar who has failed to set a high example for the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
