SUMMARY: At a West Virginia rally, Trump again denied collusion with Russia, despite recent legal developments involving his former associates. Michael Cohen, Trump's ex-personal attorney, pleaded guilty to multiple crimes and admitted to making hush payments at Trump's direction during the 2016 campaign. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud. Despite evidence of Trump's unfitness for office, including his lies and attempts to obstruct justice, the focus on collusion may be misplaced. Trump's behavior as president, including his compulsive lying, bullying, and harassment, is the real scandal. While he may not have colluded with Russia, his actions since the investigations began have raised suspicions. The article concludes that the true scandal is not collusion, but Trump's overall character and conduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
