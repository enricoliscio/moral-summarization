SUMMARY: During a rally in West Virginia, President Donald Trump once again denied any collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, despite ongoing investigations and mounting evidence to the contrary. The focus on collusion, however, may be missing the point. Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to multiple crimes, including campaign finance violations, and admitted to making hush payments to women at Trump's direction. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was also found guilty on felony tax and bank fraud charges. While the exact extent of Trump's knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting with Russian representatives remains unclear, his behavior as president, including his constant lying, bullying of law enforcement, and defense of Russia despite intelligence findings, provides clear evidence of his unfitness for office. The real scandal, the article argues, is not collusion but Trump's character and conduct. 

END OF SUMMARY.
