SUMMARY:
At a recent rally, President Trump denied Russian collusion, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort being found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's denial is "ancillary" at this point, as his behavior since the investigations began has lent credence to his possible guilt. His "incivility" and "lying" have become a hallmark of his presidency, and his "bullying" and "harassing" of law enforcement officials have undermined the investigation. Trump's "poor character" is on full display, and his "compulsion to lie" has constructed his own reality. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump himself, who has set an "appallingly low example" for the presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
