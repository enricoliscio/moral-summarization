SUMMARY:
At a recent West Virginia rally, President Donald Trump once again denied any collusion with Russia, despite mounting evidence of his campaign's wrongdoing. Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to several crimes, including illegal campaign contributions and tax evasion, admitting that Trump ordered him to break the law. Meanwhile, Trump's ex-campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on eight felony charges. Trump's response has been to deflect and deny, choosing to focus solely on the collusion charge while ignoring the other immoral and illegal activities. Trump has lied, bullied, and harassed his way through the investigations, even siding with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence regarding election meddling. The real scandal is not collusion but Trump's own behavior, marked by lies, harassment, and a shocking lack of moral character. His presidency is a disgraceful example of mendacity and scandalous behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
