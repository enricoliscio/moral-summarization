SUMMARY:

The article highlights the moral bankruptcy of President Donald Trump, who continues to deny Russian collusion despite mounting evidence against him. At a recent rally, Trump prodded the crowd into chanting "Where is the collusion?" just hours after his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. The author argues that Trump's denial of collusion is beside the point, as his behavior since taking office has demonstrated his unfitness for the presidency. Trump's lies, bullying of law enforcement officials, and willingness to take the word of a brutal dictator like Vladimir Putin over US intelligence all demonstrate his poor character. The real scandal, the author concludes, is not collusion, but Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.
