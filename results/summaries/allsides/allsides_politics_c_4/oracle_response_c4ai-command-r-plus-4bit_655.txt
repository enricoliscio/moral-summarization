SUMMARY: The article focuses on the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Despite Trump's repeated denial of any collusion and his attempts at evasion, the author argues that the real scandal is Trump's own behavior and character. The president has been caught lying, bullying, and harassing, and has tried to undermine the investigation at every turn. Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions and admitted to buying the silence of women with whom Trump had affairs. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has been found guilty of tax and bank fraud. The author argues that Trump's greatest transgression is his constant lying, which sets a low example for the country. While it may be difficult to prove collusion, Trump's behavior since the investigation began has only lent more credence to the allegations.
END OF SUMMARY.
