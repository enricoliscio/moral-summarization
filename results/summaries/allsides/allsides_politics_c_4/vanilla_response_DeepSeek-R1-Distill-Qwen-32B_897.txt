Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about Donald Trump and his denials of collusion with Russia. It mentions his recent rally where he kept repeating that there's no collusion. Then it brings up Michael Cohen's guilty plea, which involved illegal campaign contributions and payments to silence women before the 2016 election. Cohen said Trump ordered him to break the law. Also, Paul Manafort was found guilty of tax and bank fraud. Despite all this, Trump continues to deny collusion. The article suggests that while proving collusion is tough, Trump's behavior since the investigations started makes him seem guilty. He's been lying, obstructing justice, and undermining Mueller's investigation. The author argues that the real scandal isn't the collusion but Trump's character and actions. 

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's denial at the rally, then Cohen's guilty plea and Manafort's conviction. Highlight that Trump is still denying collusion despite these developments. Then, note the difficulty in proving collusion but Trump's behavior making him seem guilty. Mention his lies, obstruction, and support for Putin. Conclude that the real scandal is his character, not collusion. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump continues to deny collusion with Russia despite recent developments, including his former attorney Michael Cohen's guilty plea for illegal campaign contributions and payments to silence women before the 2016 election. Cohen admitted Trump ordered him to break the law. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was also convicted of fraud. Trump's denial comes amid mounting evidence of his misconduct, including lying about his involvement in the Trump Tower meeting, payments to Stormy Daniels, and efforts to obstruct investigations. The article suggests that while proving collusion is challenging, Trump's behavior since the investigations began supports the idea of his possible guilt. His constant lying, obstruction of justice, and support for Russian leader Vladimir Putin further undermine his credibility. The real scandal, the author argues, is not collusion but Trump's character and actions as president. END OF SUMMARY.
