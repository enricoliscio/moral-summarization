Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Donald Trump's denial of collusion with Russia, especially after his attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty and his campaign manager Paul Manafort was convicted. It mentions how Trump keeps repeating "There is No Collusion" despite these developments. The author points out that while proving collusion might be hard, Trump's behavior, like lying and obstructing justice, shows he's unfit for office. The article also criticizes Trump's character and actions, such as believing Putin over U.S. intelligence. The conclusion is that the real scandal isn't collusion but Trump himself.

So, the summary should include Trump's denial, the guilty pleas and convictions, the difficulty in proving collusion, Trump's unfitness due to his behavior, and the main point that the scandal is Trump's character, not collusion.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and covers all these points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step: start with Trump's denial, mention Cohen and Manafort's cases, discuss the challenges in proving collusion, highlight Trump's unfit behavior, and end with the main takeaway that the scandal is Trump's character.

I should avoid using too many quotes and keep it factual. Also, ensure it's clear and flows well. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The article discusses Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, despite recent developments involving his former attorney, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who was convicted of tax and bank fraud. Trump's refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing, even as evidence of his questionable behavior mounts, is criticized. The piece argues that while proving collusion may be difficult, Trump's actions—such as lying, obstructing justice, and prioritizing Russian interests over U.S. intelligence—demonstrate his unfitness for office. The article concludes that the real scandal is not the collusion itself but Trump's character and behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
