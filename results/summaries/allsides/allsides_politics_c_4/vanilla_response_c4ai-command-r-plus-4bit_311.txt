SUMMARY: At a West Virginia rally, Trump continued to deny collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, despite ongoing investigations and recent legal developments implicating those close to him. Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty to several crimes, including campaign finance violations, and admitted to making hush money payments to women at Trump's behest. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's focus on "no collusion" is misplaced, as there is ample evidence of his unfitness for office, including his lies, bullying of law enforcement, and support for Russia despite its meddling in the 2016 election. While Trump may not have colluded with Russia, his behavior since the investigations began has been questionable, and his compulsive lying and low standards of conduct are the real scandal.
END OF SUMMARY.
