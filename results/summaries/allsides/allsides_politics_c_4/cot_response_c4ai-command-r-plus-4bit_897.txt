SUMMARY:
Amid ongoing investigations into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, President Donald Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing, focusing on the lack of direct evidence of collusion. However, the author argues that while collusion may be difficult to prove, Trump's behavior as president provides clear evidence of his unfitness for office. Trump has lied repeatedly, bullied law enforcement, and undermined the integrity of the investigations. His denial of Russian meddling in the election, despite indictments of Russian agents, demonstrates a lack of integrity and sets a low moral example. While Trump may be telling the truth about collusion, his overall character and actions as president, including illegal campaign contributions and payments to women, are scandalous and reflect poorly on his leadership. The real scandal, according to the author, is not collusion but Trump's own conduct and disregard for the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
