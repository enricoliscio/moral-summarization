Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump's repeated denial of collusion with Russia, despite various legal issues involving his associates like Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. The article also touches on Trump's behavior, such as lying, undermining investigations, and his questionable character.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's denial of collusion and the context of Cohen's guilty plea and Manafort's conviction. Then, I'll include Trump's actions like lying, circumventing campaign finance laws, and undermining investigations. I should also highlight his moral failings and the idea that the real scandal is his character, not just the collusion.

I'll make sure to use words like "deny," "collusion," "fraud," "payments," "ordered," "lying," "undermine," "transgressions," "mendacity," and "liar" as they are part of the moral framing. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the denials, moving to the evidence against him, and concluding with the moral judgment about his character.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions beyond what's in the article and stick strictly to summarizing the content while maintaining the moral tone. Let me piece this together, ensuring each sentence captures a key point and uses the appropriate moral terms.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump repeatedly denies collusion with Russia, a claim that has become a cornerstone of his rhetoric. Despite Michael Cohen's guilty plea for tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions, and Paul Manafort's conviction for tax and bank fraud, Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing. Trump has been accused of lying about his involvement in various schemes, including payments to silence women like Stormy Daniels, and circumventing campaign finance laws. He has also been criticized for undermining investigations and taking the word of Russian leader Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence. Trump's behavior, marked by mendacity, bullying, and harassment, has raised questions about his fitness for office. While the legal case for collusion may be difficult to prove, Trump's transgressions and lies have set a low moral example. The real scandal, the article suggests, is not just the potential collusion but Trump's character and actions. END OF SUMMARY.
