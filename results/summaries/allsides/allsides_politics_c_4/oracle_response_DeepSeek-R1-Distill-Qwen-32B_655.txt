Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I should try to include as many as possible without making the summary too long—no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump denying collusion with Russia, even as his associates are facing charges. The author is critical of Trump's behavior, highlighting his lies, attempts to undermine investigations, and his overall unfitness for office.

I should start by mentioning Trump's denial of collusion, using the word "deny." Then, note the context with Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort's guilty pleas, using terms like "fraud" and "found guilty." I'll need to include how Trump ordered Cohen to make illegal payments, using "ordered" and "fraud." 

Next, I should touch on Trump's lies about not knowing about the payments and his attempts to stop investigations, using words like "lying," "stop," and "undermine." Also, mention his support for Putin despite the indictments, using "meddling" and "indicted."

Finally, the article concludes that the real scandal is Trump's character, so I'll use terms like "transgressions," "lie," and "example." I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it to highlight Trump's actions, the charges against his associates, his lies, and the moral implications.

SUMMARY: The article discusses Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, a narrative he repeatedly promotes despite mounting evidence of misconduct. Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions, admitting to making payments to silence women, as ordered by Trump. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud. Trump's denial of collusion remains central, even as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates potential wrongdoing. Trump's behavior—lying about his knowledge of Cohen's payments, bullying law enforcement, and undermining investigations—underscores his unfitness for office. His decision to trust Russian leader Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence further erodes his credibility. While Trump may not have colluded with Russia, his mendacity and transgressions, such as lying and circumventing campaign finance laws, set a discreditable example. The real scandal, the article suggests, is Trump's character and actions, not just the collusion allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
