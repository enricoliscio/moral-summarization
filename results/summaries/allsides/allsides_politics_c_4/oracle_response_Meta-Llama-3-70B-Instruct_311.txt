SUMMARY:

At a recent rally, President Trump once again denied collusion with Russia, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. Cohen admitted to making six-figure payments to women to buy their silence, and said Trump ordered him to break the law by circumventing the campaign-finance reporting system. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty on eight felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's denial of collusion rings hollow, given his history of lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials to stop investigating him. He has also undermined the investigation by taking to Twitter to claim it's a "witch hunt." The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump's poor character, exemplified by his uncontrollable compulsion to lie and his refusal to set a high example for the nation. His behavior has lent credence to his possible guilt, and he deserves zero credit for his denials.

END OF SUMMARY.
