SUMMARY:

The article criticizes President Donald Trump's repeated denials of collusion with Russia, despite mounting evidence of his misconduct. At a recent rally, Trump prodded the crowd to chant "Where is the collusion?" just hours after his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud. The article argues that Trump's behavior, including his lies and attempts to undermine the investigation, demonstrate his unfitness for office. The author suggests that even if Trump didn't collude with Russia, his poor character and constant dishonesty have eroded trust and set a terrible example for the nation. The real scandal, the article concludes, is not collusion, but Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.
