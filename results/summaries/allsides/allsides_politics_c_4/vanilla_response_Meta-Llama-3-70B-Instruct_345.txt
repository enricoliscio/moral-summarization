SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Donald Trump continues to deny Russian collusion despite mounting evidence against him. At a recent rally, Trump prodded the crowd to chant "Where is the collusion?" even after his former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions and admitted to making payments to women to buy their silence during the 2016 election. Trump's denials are seen as ironic given his own behavior, including lying about his involvement in his son's statement about a Trump Tower meeting with Russian representatives and bullying law enforcement officials to stop investigating him. The article argues that Trump's poor character and compulsive lying have lent credence to his possible guilt, and that the real scandal is not collusion, but Trump himself. The author concludes that Trump's behavior has set a low example for the presidency, and that his denials of collusion are not credible.
