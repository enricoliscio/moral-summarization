SUMMARY: During a rally in West Virginia, Donald Trump continued his denial of Russian collusion, despite recent legal developments implicating his former associates. Michael Cohen, Trump's ex-personal attorney, pleaded guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions, admitting he bought the silence of women with knowledge of Trump's transgressions. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, was found guilty of eight felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's obsession with denying collusion is now beside the point as his behavior and lies since the investigations began have lent credence to his possible guilt. Trump has lied about his involvement in Donald Trump Jr.'s statement regarding the Trump Tower meeting and payments to Stormy Daniels. He has bullied and harassed law enforcement to stop investigating him and taken to Twitter to undermine the investigation. Trump even sided with Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence on Russian meddling in the 2016 election. While Trump may be telling the truth about no collusion, his lack of discipline and attention span make it hard to believe he could carry out such a conspiracy. The real scandal is Trump's poor character and the appallingly low example he sets.
END OF SUMMARY.
