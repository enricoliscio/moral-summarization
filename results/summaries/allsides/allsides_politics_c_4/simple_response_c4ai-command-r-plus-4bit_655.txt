SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing investigation into President Donald Trump's potential collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election, and how Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Despite the lack of clear evidence of collusion, the author argues that Trump's behavior since the investigation began has been appalling and indicative of his poor character. The author highlights Trump's lies, bullying, and harassment of law enforcement officials, as well as his defense of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin despite evidence of Russian meddling in the election. While Trump may be telling the truth about no collusion, his overall behavior as president has set a low example for the country. The scandal, the author argues, is not collusion but Trump himself.
