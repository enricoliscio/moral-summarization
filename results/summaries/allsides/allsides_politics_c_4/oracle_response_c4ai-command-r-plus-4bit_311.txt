SUMMARY: At a recent rally, President Donald Trump continued to deny any collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election, despite ongoing investigations and mounting evidence to the contrary. The focus on collusion, however, may be missing the point as Trump's behavior since taking office has been filled with denial, evasion, fraud, and lies. Trump has lied about his involvement in his son's statement regarding the Trump Tower meeting with Russian representatives and about his knowledge of payments made to buy the silence of women. He has bullied and harassed law enforcement officials, tried to undermine investigations, and taken the word of Russian President Vladimir Putin over that of U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump's poor character and lack of discipline are on full display, and while he may not have colluded with Russia, his actions during the investigations have only added to suspicions of his possible guilt. The real scandal, it seems, is not collusion but Trump's own conduct and mendacity.
END OF SUMMARY.
