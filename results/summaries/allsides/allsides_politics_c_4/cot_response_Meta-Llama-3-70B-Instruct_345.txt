SUMMARY:
At a recent rally, President Trump denied Russian collusion, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions. Trump's denial is jarring, given Cohen's admission that he made six-figure payments to women to buy their silence, and Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort being found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's behavior is a clear example of his poor character, marked by lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials. His uncontrollable compulsion to lie has lent credence to his possible guilt. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump himself, who has set an appallingly low example for the presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
