SUMMARY:

The article criticizes President Donald Trump's repeated denials of collusion with Russia, despite mounting evidence of his wrongdoing. At a recent rally, Trump prodded the crowd to chant "Where is the collusion?" just hours after his former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and former campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. The author argues that Trump's behavior, including lying and bullying law enforcement officials, demonstrates his poor character and unfitness for office. While it may be difficult to prove collusion, Trump's actions have lent credence to his possible guilt. The real scandal, the author concludes, is not collusion, but Trump himself, who has set a low example for the presidency. His repeated lies and attempts to undermine the investigation have eroded trust and damaged the office of the presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
