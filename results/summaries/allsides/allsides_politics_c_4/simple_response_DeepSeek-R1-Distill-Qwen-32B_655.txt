Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Donald Trump's repeated denial of collusion with Russia, even as evidence against him mounts. It mentions Michael Cohen's guilty plea and Paul Manafort's conviction, which are significant because they involve illegal campaign contributions and fraud. The author seems critical of Trump, highlighting his lies, obstruction of justice, and support for Putin despite the Russian meddling.

I should capture the moral judgment here. The author is implying that Trump's behavior, like lying and undermining investigations, is worse than the collusion charge. The key points to include are the denials, the guilty pleas, Trump's lies, and his overall unfitness for office. I need to make sure the summary reflects that the real scandal is Trump's character, not just the collusion.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Trump's denials, then the legal issues with Cohen and Manafort. Next, I'll highlight Trump's dishonesty and obstruction, followed by his support for Putin. Finally, I'll conclude that the real scandal is his character, not the collusion itself. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure the moral tone is clear.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has repeatedly denied collusion with Russia, a claim that has become a cornerstone of his rhetoric despite mounting evidence of misconduct. Last week, his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions, admitting to making payments to silence women before the 2016 election, as ordered by Trump. Meanwhile, Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted of tax and bank fraud. Trump’s denial of collusion, a charge Mueller struggled to prove, is overshadowed by his demonstrated unfit character. Trump has lied about his involvement in the Trump Tower meeting, denied knowledge of Cohen’s payments, and harassed law enforcement to stop investigations. He also supported Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence findings of Russian election meddling. While Trump may not have colluded with Russia, his behavior—marked by dishonesty, obstruction, and self-serving narratives—underscores his unfitness for office. The real scandal, the article argues, is not collusion but Trump’s abysmal character and the low standard he has set as president. END OF SUMMARY.
