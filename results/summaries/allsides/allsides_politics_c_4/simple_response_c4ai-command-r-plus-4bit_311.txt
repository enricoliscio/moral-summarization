SUMMARY: At a recent rally in West Virginia, President Donald Trump once again denied any collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election, despite ongoing investigations and mounting evidence to the contrary. This denial comes in the wake of guilty pleas and convictions of former Trump associates, including Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, on various charges of fraud and illegal campaign contributions. While the collusion charge may be difficult to prove, Trump's behavior as president, including his constant lying, bullying of law enforcement, and undermining of the investigations, clearly demonstrates his unfitness for office. Trump's denial of Russian meddling in the election, despite indictments of Russian agents, and his groveling at the feet of Vladimir Putin further underscore his poor character and low standards. The real scandal, it seems, is not collusion but Trump's own actions and conduct as president.
END OF SUMMARY.
