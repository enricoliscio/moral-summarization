SUMMARY:

The article argues that the real scandal is not Russian collusion, but Donald Trump's poor character and behavior as president. Despite his former attorney Michael Cohen's guilty plea to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort's guilty verdict on eight felony charges, Trump continues to deny collusion. The article suggests that Trump's denial is beside the point, as his actions and lies have lent credence to his possible guilt. The president's uncontrollable compulsion to lie about everything, including his knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting and Cohen's payments to women, has set a low example for the nation. The article concludes that Trump's behavior, including bullying law enforcement officials and taking the word of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence, is the real scandal, and that his denial of collusion is just a small part of a larger pattern of dishonesty and unfitness for office.

END OF SUMMARY.
