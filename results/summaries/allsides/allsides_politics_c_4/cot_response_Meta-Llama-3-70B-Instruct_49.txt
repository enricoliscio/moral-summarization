SUMMARY:
At a recent rally, President Trump once again denied any collusion with Russia, despite the guilty pleas of his former associates, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. Trump's denials are jarring, given the mounting evidence of his unfit behavior, including lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials. His poor character is on full display, as he constructs his own reality and hopes others won't catch up. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump himself, who has set an appallingly low example for the nation. His behavior is a stark reminder that honesty, integrity, and respect for the law are essential qualities for a president, and Trump falls woefully short. END OF SUMMARY.
