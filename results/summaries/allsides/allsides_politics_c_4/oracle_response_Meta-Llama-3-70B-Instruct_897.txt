SUMMARY:

At a recent rally, President Trump denied collusion with Russia, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. Cohen admitted to making six-figure payments to women to buy their silence, and Trump ordered him to break the law by circumventing campaign-finance reporting. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty on eight felony charges. Trump's denial of collusion is particularly jarring given his history of lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials to undermine the investigation. His behavior has lent credence to his possible guilt, and his uncontrollable compulsion to lie has set a low example for the presidency. Trump's denial of collusion is beside the point, as his own actions have demonstrated his unfitness for office. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump himself.

END OF SUMMARY.
