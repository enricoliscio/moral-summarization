SUMMARY: During a rally in West Virginia, President Donald Trump once again denied collusion with Russia, despite ongoing investigations and recent developments in the case. Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to multiple crimes, including campaign finance violations, and admitted to making hush payments to women at Trump's direction. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud charges. Despite the mounting evidence of Trump's misconduct, he continues to focus solely on denying collusion. The article argues that while Trump may be telling the truth about no collusion, his behavior as president, including his constant lying and attempts to obstruct justice, make him unfit for office. The real scandal, the article suggests, is not collusion but Trump's overall character and conduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
