SUMMARY: In the wake of recent legal developments involving former associates of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States continues to deny any collusion with Russia, a charge that now seems ancillary. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, pleaded guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions, admitting he made hush payments to women at Trump's order. Meanwhile, Trump's ex-campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on eight felony tax and bank fraud charges. Despite the turmoil, Trump remains defiant, focusing solely on denying collusion. Trump's behavior since the investigations began, including his compulsive lying, bullying, and harassment of law enforcement, only lends credence to his possible guilt. The real scandal, according to the author, is not collusion but Trump himself, whose poor character and lack of discipline make him unfit for office. The president sets a low example with his denial and evasion tactics, undermining the truth and the integrity of the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
