SUMMARY:
Amid the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, President Donald Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing. Despite his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to a range of crimes, including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, being found guilty of tax and bank fraud, Trump remains focused on denying collusion. The author argues that while collusion may be difficult to prove, Trump's behavior as president, including his compulsive lying and bullying of law enforcement officials, provides clear evidence of his unfitness for office. The real scandal, according to the author, is not collusion but Trump himself and the low example he has set in response to the allegations. Trump's denial of Russian interference in the election, despite evidence to the contrary, is also highlighted as a sign of his poor character and lack of regard for the truth. The article concludes by criticizing Trump's mendacity and the appallingly low example he has set as president, even if he is telling the truth about collusion.
