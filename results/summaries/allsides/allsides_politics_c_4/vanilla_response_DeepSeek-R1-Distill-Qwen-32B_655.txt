Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Donald Trump and the collusion issue. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts with Trump repeatedly denying collusion at a rally, which is a common theme for him. It mentions Michael Cohen's guilty plea and Paul Manafort's conviction. The key point is that Trump is denying collusion despite these developments. 

I should note that Cohen admitted to making payments to women to buy their silence, which Trump ordered. Manafort's guilty verdict adds to the legal troubles. The article points out that while Trump denies collusion, his behavior as president shows unfitness for office. 

There's a mention of Trump lying about various things, like his involvement in his son's statement, the Stormy Daniels payments, and his interactions with Russian officials. The author argues that even if Trump didn't collude, his overall behavior is scandalous. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's denial, the legal issues with Cohen and Manafort, and then touch on Trump's lies and actions. Finally, I'll conclude that the real scandal is Trump's behavior, not just collusion.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump continues to deny collusion with Russia, a claim he frequently repeats despite recent legal developments. Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, admitting Trump ordered him to make payments to silence women before the 2016 election. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted of tax and bank fraud. Trump's denial of collusion comes amid evidence of his dishonesty, such as lying about his son's statement after the Trump Tower meeting, denying knowledge of Cohen's payments to Stormy Daniels, and undermining U.S. intelligence regarding Russian election interference. The article suggests that while proving collusion may be difficult, Trump's behavior since the investigations began has raised questions about his guilt. His constant lying and manipulation of reality have set a poor example, making the real scandal not just potential collusion but Trump's overall unfit character. END OF SUMMARY.
