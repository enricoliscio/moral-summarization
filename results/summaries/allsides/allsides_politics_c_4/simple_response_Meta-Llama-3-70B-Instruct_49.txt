SUMMARY:

The article highlights the irony of President Trump's repeated denials of collusion with Russia, despite the mounting evidence of his poor character and unfit behavior for office. Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. Yet, Trump continues to deny collusion, which is now beside the point. The article argues that Trump's behavior, including lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials, has lent credence to his possible guilt. The real scandal is not collusion, but Trump himself, who has set a low example for the presidency. His compulsive lying and lack of discipline make it difficult to believe his denials of collusion. The article concludes that Trump's character is the real issue, and his behavior has undermined the office of the presidency.
