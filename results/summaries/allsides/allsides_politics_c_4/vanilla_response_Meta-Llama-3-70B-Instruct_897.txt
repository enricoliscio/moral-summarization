SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Donald Trump continues to deny Russian collusion despite mounting evidence against him. At a recent rally, Trump prodded the crowd to chant "Where is the collusion?" just hours after his former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty of tax and bank fraud. The article argues that Trump's denial of collusion is beside the point, as his behavior since the investigations began has lent credence to his possible guilt. Trump's constant lying, bullying of law enforcement officials, and undermining of the investigation have shown his poor character. While it may be difficult to prove collusion, Trump's actions have set a low example for the presidency. The real scandal, the article concludes, is not collusion, but Trump himself.
