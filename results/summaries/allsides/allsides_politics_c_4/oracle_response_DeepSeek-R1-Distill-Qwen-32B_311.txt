Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's denial of collusion with Russia, despite evidence from Cohen and Manafort's trials. The author criticizes Trump's behavior, like lying, obstructing justice, and undermining investigations. They argue that while collusion might be hard to prove, Trump's overall conduct is the real scandal.

Now, I'll identify the key morally framed words from the list that are central to the article. Words like "denial," "fraud," "lying," "mendacity," "transgressions," "collusion," "deny," "ordered," "break," "undermine," "indicted," "example," "set," "liar," "keep," "keeping," and "example" are crucial.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's repeated denials, the evidence against him, his unethical actions, and the author's conclusion that his behavior is the real scandal. I'll ensure each sentence incorporates the moral terms without making it sound forced.

Let me draft a concise version, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start with Trump's denial, mention Cohen and Manafort, then move on to his lies and obstruction. Finally, I'll conclude with the author's point that his character is the issue, not just collusion.

I need to make sure each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Let me piece it together, ensuring all key points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, despite overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing. Trump's repeated claims of "no collusion" are morally framed as evasion and denial, even as his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. Cohen admitted to making payments to silence women, ordered by Trump, and circumventing campaign-finance laws. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud. Trump's behavior, including lying about his knowledge of Cohen's payments, bullying law enforcement, and undermining investigations, underscores his mendacity and unethical conduct. The author argues that while proving collusion may be difficult, Trump's overall character—marked by lies, transgressions, and a disregard for truth—is the real scandal. His actions, such as taking Putin's word over U.S. intelligence, further highlight his unfitness for office. The moral framing emphasizes Trump's compulsion to lie, his construction of a false reality, and his failure to set a high example as a leader. END OF SUMMARY.
