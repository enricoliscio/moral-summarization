SUMMARY:

At a recent rally, President Trump denied collusion with Russia, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. Cohen admitted to making payments to women to buy their silence, and Trump ordered him to break the law by circumventing campaign finance reporting. Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort was also found guilty of eight felony charges. Trump's denial of collusion is particularly jarring given the mounting evidence of his unfit behavior, including lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials. He has also undermined the investigation into Russian meddling, instead taking the word of brutal dictator Vladimir Putin over US intelligence. Trump's poor character and compulsive lying have lent credence to his possible guilt, making his denial of collusion ring hollow. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump himself, who has set an appalling low example for the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
