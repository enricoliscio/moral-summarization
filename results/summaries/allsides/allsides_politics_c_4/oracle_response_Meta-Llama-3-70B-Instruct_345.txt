SUMMARY:

At a recent rally, President Trump denied collusion with Russia, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort being found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's denial is particularly jarring given the mounting evidence of his unfit behavior, including lying about his involvement in his son's statement about the Trump Tower meeting, lying about his knowledge of Cohen's payments to Stormy Daniels, and bullying and harassing law enforcement officials to stop investigating him. Trump's behavior is a stark example of incivility, and his constant lying and denial of wrongdoing have lent credence to his possible guilt. The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump's own poor character and mendacity. He has set a low example for the presidency, and his lies and bullying have undermined the investigation and strained U.S.-Russia relations. END OF SUMMARY.
