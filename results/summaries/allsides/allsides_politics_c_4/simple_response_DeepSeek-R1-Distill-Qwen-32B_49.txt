Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of Trump, so the summary should reflect that tone. I'll start by identifying the main points: Trump's denial of collusion, Cohen's guilty plea, Manafort's conviction, and Trump's behavior during the investigations. I should also highlight the moral issues like lying, undermining investigations, and the overall character flaws. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the essence of the article's critique.

SUMMARY: The article critically examines Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, despite overwhelming evidence of misconduct. Trump's repeated claims of "no collusion" are highlighted as part of his rhetorical playbook, alongside "Fake News" and "Hillary’s Emails." The piece notes that Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, admitting Trump ordered him to break the law. Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was also convicted of fraud. The article argues that while Trump's collusion may be difficult to prove, his behavior since the investigations began—lying, bullying law enforcement, and undermining investigations—underscores his unfitness for office. Trump's refusal to accept the findings of U.S. intelligence and his defense of Russian leader Vladimir Putin further erode his credibility. The author concludes that the real scandal isn't collusion but Trump's character and actions, which set a dangerous precedent. END OF SUMMARY.
