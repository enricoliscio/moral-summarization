SUMMARY:
Amid ongoing investigations into possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election, US President Donald Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing. At a recent rally in West Virginia, Trump played on his greatest hits, including "There is No Collusion," "Fake News," and "Hillary's Emails," rallying the crowd into adoration. However, recent developments in the cases of Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, both pleading guilty to various crimes including fraud and illegal campaign contributions, cast doubt on Trump's innocence. Trump's behavior since the investigations began has been appalling, marked by lies, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials. He even took the word of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over US intelligence regarding Russian meddling in the election. The real scandal, however, is not collusion but Trump himself and his mendacity, setting a low example for the country.
