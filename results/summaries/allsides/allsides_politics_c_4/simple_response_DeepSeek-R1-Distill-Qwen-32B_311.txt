Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is critical of Trump, so I should maintain that tone. Let me read through it again.

The article starts with Trump denying collusion at a rally, which is a recurring theme for him. It mentions Michael Cohen's guilty plea and Paul Manafort's conviction, which are key points. I should include that because it shows Trump's associates are guilty, but Trump denies collusion.

The author argues that even if Trump didn't collude, his behavior is problematic. He lied about Cohen's payments, tried to interfere with investigations, and supported Putin despite evidence of Russian meddling. These actions show poor character and unfitness for office.

I need to highlight that the main issue isn't just collusion but Trump's overall behavior. The summary should mention the lies, obstruction, and support for Putin. It should conclude that the real scandal is Trump himself, not just the collusion charge.

I should keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral critique is clear. Let me structure it: start with Trump's denial, mention Cohen and Manafort, then his lies and obstruction, and end with the real scandal being Trump's character.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, despite his associates' guilty pleas and convictions for crimes like tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions. Michael Cohen admitted to making payments to silence women, while Paul Manafort was found guilty of fraud. Trump's behavior, including lying about his knowledge of Cohen's actions, bullying law enforcement, and defending Russian President Vladimir Putin, underscores his unfit character for office. While it may be difficult to prove collusion, Trump's consistent mendacity and obstruction of justice highlight his unfitness for leadership. The article concludes that the real scandal is not just potential collusion but Trump's egregious behavior and moral failings. END OF SUMMARY.
