Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary needs to reflect the author's perspective on Trump's actions and character.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump's repeated denials of collusion with Russia, despite evidence from Cohen and Manafort's guilty pleas. It also mentions Trump's lies, attempts to obstruct justice, and his distrust in Mueller's investigation. The author argues that while collusion might be hard to prove, Trump's overall behavior shows he's unfit for office.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. These include words like "looking," "denial," "evasion," "fraud," "contributions," "payments," "buy," "ordered," "break," "circumventing," "found," "denies," "collusion," "deny," "colluding," "stop," "imitating," "incivility," "lying," "bullying," "harassing," "get," "undermine," "investigation," "taking," "meddled," "indicted," "meddling," "groveled," "claiming," "transgressions," "lie," "constructs," "mendacity," "liar," "keep," "keeping," "example," "set."

I should make sure to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too verbose. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and capture the essence of the article's moral stance against Trump.

I'll structure the summary by first mentioning Trump's denial of collusion, then Cohen's guilty plea and Manafort's conviction. Then, I'll highlight Trump's lies, obstruction of justice, and his support for Putin despite the evidence. Finally, I'll conclude that the real scandal is Trump's character, not just the collusion.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral judgment present in the original article. I'll avoid any neutral or objective language and instead use the charged words to convey the author's viewpoint effectively.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump repeatedly denies collusion with Russia, despite evidence from Michael Cohen's guilty plea and Paul Manafort's conviction. Cohen admitted to making illegal payments to silence women, as Trump ordered him to break campaign-finance laws. Trump's denial of collusion is a distraction, as his behavior—lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement—underscores his unfitness for office. He has lied about his involvement in the Trump Tower meeting, denied knowledge of Cohen's payments to Stormy Daniels, and undermined Mueller's investigation. Trump also sided with Putin, claiming Mueller's "witch hunt" harmed U.S.-Russia relations, despite 12 Russian agents being indicted for meddling. While Trump may not have colluded with Russia, his mendacity and poor character make him unfit for leadership. The real scandal is not collusion but Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.
