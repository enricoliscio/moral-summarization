SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Donald Trump continues to deny collusion with Russia, despite mounting evidence against him. At a recent rally, Trump prodded the crowd to chant "Where is the collusion?" even after his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of tax and bank fraud. The article argues that Trump's denial of collusion is now beside the point, as his behavior since the investigations began has lent more credence to his possible guilt. The author highlights Trump's poor character, uncontrollable compulsion to lie, and failure to set a high example as a president. The real scandal, the article concludes, is not collusion, but Trump himself.
