Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Trump denying collusion with Russia, even as his associates are facing charges. The author seems critical, pointing out his lies and unethical behavior. I should focus on the key points: Trump's denial, Cohen and Manafort's guilty pleas, Trump's lies about Cohen's payments, his undermining of investigations, and his support for Putin despite the indictments. The moral angle is about Trump's character flaws and how his actions undermine the presidency. I'll make sure to highlight these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it to show Trump's denial, the evidence against him, his unethical behavior, and the conclusion that the real scandal is his character. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and to the point.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, despite overwhelming evidence of unethical behavior and legal wrongdoing by his associates. Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort have pleaded guilty to crimes tied to Trump's campaign, including illegal payments and fraud. Trump's refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing, even as his own lies and attempts to obstruct justice are exposed, underscores his flawed character. The author argues that while proving collusion may be difficult, Trump's repeated lies, disregard for the truth, and support for Russian leader Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence paint a clear picture of an unfit president. The real scandal, the article concludes, is not just potential collusion but Trump's abysmal moral and ethical standards as a leader. END OF SUMMARY.
