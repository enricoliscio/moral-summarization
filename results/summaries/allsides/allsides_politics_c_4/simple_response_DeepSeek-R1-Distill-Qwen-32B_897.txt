Alright, I need to summarize this article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about Donald Trump's denial of collusion with Russia and the implications of his behavior.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about Trump's repeated denial of collusion, the guilty pleas from Cohen and Manafort, and how Trump's actions, like lying and undermining investigations, reflect poorly on his character.

I need to make sure the summary captures that the real issue isn't just collusion but Trump's overall behavior and dishonesty. The author seems critical of Trump, emphasizing his unfitness for office through his actions and lies.

I should structure the summary to first mention the collusion denial, then the guilty pleas, followed by Trump's dishonesty and manipulation. Finally, highlight that the real scandal is his character, not just the collusion.

I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically from one point to the next, maintaining the moral judgment present in the original text.

SUMMARY: The article discusses Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, despite mounting evidence of his unethical behavior. Trump's refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing, even as his associates like Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort face charges, underscores his pattern of dishonesty and manipulation. The author argues that while proving collusion is difficult, Trump's actions—such as lying about his knowledge of Cohen's payments and undermining investigations—demonstrate his unfitness for office. The real scandal, the article concludes, is not just the potential collusion but Trump's overall character and his disregard for truth and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
