SUMMARY: "There is no collusion," claims Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, amidst ongoing investigations and charges of fraud, evasion, and illegal campaign contributions. Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty to crimes including tax evasion and admitted to making hush payments to women at Trump's order before the 2016 election. Meanwhile, Trump's ex-campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on eight felony charges. Despite the mounting evidence of wrongdoing, Trump continues to deny collusion with Russia and shifts blame, even taking the word of Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence. Trump's behavior, including his compulsive lying, bullying, and harassing, sets a low example and erodes trust. The real scandal, it seems, is not collusion but Trump's own actions and character. His denial and evasion of the truth only further damage his already tarnished reputation.
END OF SUMMARY.
