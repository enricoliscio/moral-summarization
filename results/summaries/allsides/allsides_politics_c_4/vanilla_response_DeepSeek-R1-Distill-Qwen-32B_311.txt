Okay, I need to summarize this article about Donald Trump and the collusion allegations. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts with Trump's repeated denial of collusion with Russia, even as his associates like Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort face charges. Cohen admitted to making payments to silence women, which Trump ordered, and Manafort was found guilty of tax fraud. Despite all this, Trump keeps denying collusion.

The article mentions that proving collusion would require specific knowledge about a meeting in Trump Tower, which Mueller would need to show Trump knew about. However, the article argues that Trump's behavior, like lying about his involvement in the meeting, lying about Cohen's payments, and undermining investigations, shows he's unfit for office.

It also points out Trump's tendency to lie and construct his own reality, making his denials less credible. The real scandal isn't just collusion but Trump's overall behavior and character.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Trump's denials, his associates' guilty pleas, the difficulty in proving collusion, and the focus on Trump's character flaws instead. I'll make sure to mention the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The article discusses Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, even as his associates, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, face charges related to illegal activities. Cohen admitted to making payments to silence women, as ordered by Trump, while Manafort was convicted of tax and bank fraud. Despite these developments, Trump continues to deny collusion, a charge that has become secondary to his overall behavior and character. The article suggests that while proving collusion might be difficult, Trump's lies, manipulation of investigations, and disregard for truth make him unfit for office. The real scandal, the article argues, is Trump himself, not just the collusion allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
