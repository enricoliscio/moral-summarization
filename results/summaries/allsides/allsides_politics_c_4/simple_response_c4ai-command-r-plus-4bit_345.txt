SUMMARY: Trump denies collusion with Russia, but his poor character and behavior since the investigations began lend credence to his possible guilt. Despite charges of tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions against his former associates, Trump continues to focus on denying collusion, a charge that is now ancillary. Trump's behavior as president, including his compulsive lying, bullying, and harassing law enforcement officials, as well as his defense of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, provides clear evidence that he is unfit for office. The real scandal, according to the author, is not collusion but Trump's own actions and character. His administration has been marked by a constant stream of lies and a lack of discipline or attention span, which makes it hard to believe he could carry out a complicated conspiracy. 

END OF SUMMARY.
