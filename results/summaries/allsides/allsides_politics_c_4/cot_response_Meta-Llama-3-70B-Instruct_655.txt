SUMMARY:
At a West Virginia rally, President Trump denied Russian collusion, despite his former attorney Michael Cohen pleading guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort being found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. Trump's denial is "jarring" given the evidence, and his behavior is "unfit" for office. His "lying" and "bullying" of law enforcement officials have undermined the investigation, and his "groveling" to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is "appallingly low." The real scandal isn't collusion, but Trump's "poor character" and "mendacity." His "incivility" and "uncontrollable compulsion to lie" have lent credence to his possible guilt. Trump's behavior has set a "low example" for the presidency. END OF SUMMARY.
