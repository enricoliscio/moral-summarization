SUMMARY: On August 21, Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, continued to deny any collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election, despite ongoing investigations and mounting evidence to the contrary. Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to several crimes, including illegal campaign contributions, and admitted to making hush payments to women at Trump's behest. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on eight felony charges. 

Trump's focus on denying collusion is myopic, as his presidency has been characterized by a consistent pattern of lying, bullying, and a shocking lack of integrity. He has lied about his involvement in crafting his son's statement regarding the Trump Tower meeting with Russian representatives, and he has harassed law enforcement officials to halt investigations into his campaign's potential collusion with Russia. Trump even sided with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies, blaming them for poor relations with Russia. 

The true scandal is not collusion but Trump's own behavior and lack of moral character, which has consistently fallen far below the standard the American people should expect from their president. 

END OF SUMMARY.
