SUMMARY: Trump denies collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, but the real scandal is his overall behavior and character as president. Despite potential evidence of his unfitness for office, Trump continues to lie, bully, and harass, setting a low example for the country. Even if he is telling the truth about collusion, his other transgressions, including lying about his knowledge of Cohen's payments and taking Putin's word over US intelligence, are appalling and damaging to the country. Trump's denial of collusion is now beside the point as the focus should be on his overall poor character and the multiple investigations into his campaign and administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
