SUMMARY:

The article discusses how President Donald Trump continues to deny Russian collusion despite mounting evidence against him. At a recent rally, Trump prodded the crowd to chant "Where is the collusion?" just hours after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of felony tax and bank fraud charges. The article argues that Trump's denial of collusion is beside the point, as his behavior since the investigations began has lent credence to his possible guilt. The article highlights Trump's poor character, uncontrollable compulsion to lie, and lack of discipline, making it difficult to believe he didn't collude with Russia. The real scandal, the article concludes, is not collusion, but Trump himself and the low example he has set as President.
