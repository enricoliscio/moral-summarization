SUMMARY: During a rally in West Virginia, President Donald Trump continued to deny any collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, despite ongoing investigations and recent developments in the case. Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to several crimes, including campaign finance violations, and admitted to making hush payments to women at Trump's direction. Meanwhile, Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on eight felony tax and bank fraud charges. While the focus on collusion has been a recurring theme for Trump, his behavior since the investigations began, including his constant lying and attempts to undermine the investigations, is what truly calls into question his fitness for office. Despite this, Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing and shifts blame, even going so far as to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence regarding election meddling. The scandal, the article argues, is not just about potential collusion but also about Trump's overall character and conduct as president.
