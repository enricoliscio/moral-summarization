Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Donald Trump's denials of collusion with Russia. They provided the article, which is quite detailed, and specific instructions on how to format the summary. I need to make sure I follow their guidelines precisely.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump's repeated denials of collusion, even as his associates like Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort face charges. It also mentions Cohen's guilty plea involving illegal campaign contributions and payments to women to buy their silence. The author suggests that while proving collusion might be difficult, Trump's behavior, including lying and undermining investigations, paints him as unfit for office.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the key events: Trump's denials, Cohen's guilty plea, Manafort's conviction, and the implications of Trump's actions. It's important to mention that while collusion might be hard to prove, Trump's overall behavior is problematic.

I should structure the summary to first mention the denials, then the legal issues with Cohen and Manafort, and finally the broader implications of Trump's conduct. I need to keep the language clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as per the user's request.

Also, I must remember to start the summary with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without any extra formatting. I should ensure that the summary is accurate and captures the essence of the article without getting bogged down in too much detail.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each key point is included and the word count stays within limits. I'll check the word count after writing to ensure compliance.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has repeatedly denied collusion with Russia, a claim that has become a cornerstone of his rhetoric. However, recent developments, such as Michael Cohen's guilty plea to crimes including tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions, have raised questions about Trump's credibility. Cohen admitted to making payments to silence women before the 2016 election, under Trump's orders, and Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted of tax and bank fraud. Despite these legal troubles, Trump continues to deny collusion, a charge that has become secondary to his overall unfitness for office. The article highlights Trump's pattern of lying, undermining investigations, and prioritizing his own narrative over facts. While proving collusion may be difficult, Trump's behavior—such as lying about his knowledge of Cohen's actions and dismissing U.S. intelligence in favor of Russian claims—underscores his untrustworthiness. The real scandal, the article suggests, is not just potential collusion but Trump's character and actions as president. END OF SUMMARY.
