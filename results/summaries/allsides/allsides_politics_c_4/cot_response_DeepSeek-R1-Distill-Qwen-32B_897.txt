Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them step by step.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump denying collusion with Russia, despite evidence from his associates like Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. The article also talks about Trump's behavior, lying, and his overall unfitness for office.

Now, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "collusion," "deny," "corrupt," "dishonest," "unfit," etc. I'll list each of these under STEP 1.

Next, I have to write a summary. It needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll start by highlighting Trump's denial of collusion, mention Cohen's guilty plea and Manafort's conviction, then touch on Trump's behaviorâ€”lying, undermining investigations, trusting Putin over intelligence. Finally, I'll conclude that the real scandal is Trump himself, emphasizing his unfit character.

I should make sure the summary flows well and captures the moral judgment present in the original text. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to the facts presented, using the identified moral words to frame the summary appropriately.

Let me make sure I don't miss any key points. The article mentions Mueller's difficulty in proving collusion, Trump's lies about Cohen's payments, and his support for Putin despite evidence of Russian meddling. These are all important for the summary.

I think I've covered everything. Time to put it all together, keeping it under 200 words and ensuring the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses Donald Trump's persistent denial of collusion with Russia, despite evidence from his associates, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, who pleaded guilty to crimes including illegal campaign contributions and tax fraud. Trump's behavior, marked by lies, undermining investigations, and trusting Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence, raises questions about his fitness for office. While proving collusion may be difficult, Trump's dishonesty and compulsion to lie overshadow the issue. The real scandal, the article argues, is Trump himself, as his actions and character set a dangerously low example for leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
