Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Pope Francis's Christmas message. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that on Christmas Day, Pope Francis addressed the world from St. Peter's Basilica. His message was about hope and kindness towards migrants. He talked about how injustice forces people to migrate, facing dangers like deserts and seas turning into cemeteries. He also mentioned walls of indifference.

The speech is titled "Urbi et Orbi," which means "to the city and the world." He prayed for those suffering and called for goodwill and solutions to humanitarian crises. He urged ending conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and prayed for those persecuted because of their religion.

He specifically mentioned children suffering in wars and the Syrian people enduring a decade of conflict. He hopes governments and the international community will find peace solutions. Earlier, he placed a cross with a life jacket in the Vatican to remember migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean.

He also urged South Sudan leaders to form a coalition government, which could allow him to visit there in 2020. He ended by asking people to recognize suffering and help those in need, using their actions to spread love and compassion.

So, the summary should include the main points: the Christmas message, focus on migrants and injustice, the speech's title, prayer for peace and solutions, specific mentions of conflicts, the symbolic cross, the call to action, and the overall theme of hope and kindness.

I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I should structure it to flow from the message's content to the symbolic actions and the call to help others.
