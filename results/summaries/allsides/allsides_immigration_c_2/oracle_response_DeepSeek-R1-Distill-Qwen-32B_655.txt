Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included. 

First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the main points. The Pope's Christmas message focuses on migrants, conflicts, and the need for kindness and justice. He uses strong moral terms like suffering, hope, kindness, and injustices.

Next, I need to identify the key sections. The Pope addresses migrants, mentions conflicts in various regions, and calls for peace and solutions. He also took symbolic actions, like placing a cross with a life jacket, and urged leaders in South Sudan.

I should ensure the summary includes as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to cover the main themes: migrants' suffering, call for kindness, injustices causing migration, conflicts, and the Pope's symbolic actions and prayers.

I'll start with the main message, then touch on the injustices and suffering, mention the regions affected, and conclude with the Pope's symbolic gestures and call to action. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while including the moral terms.

I'll make sure each sentence flows naturally and covers all important points without omitting any key moral elements. Double-checking to include words like emigrate, injustice, prayed, solutions, etc.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: In his Christmas Day message, Pope Francis highlighted the suffering of migrants and called for kindness and justice. He condemned the injustices forcing people to emigrate, crossing deserts and seas that become cemeteries, and criticized walls of indifference. Francis prayed for those enduring crises, urging an end to conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and for the persecuted. He emphasized the need for solutions to allow people to live in peace and security. The Pope also remembered migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean and urged South Sudanese leaders to form a coalition government for stability. He concluded by calling for hearts softened to love, helping the abandoned, healing the sick, and bringing tenderness to a dark world. END OF SUMMARY.
