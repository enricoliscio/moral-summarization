SUMMARY: In his annual Christmas Day address, Pope Francis focused on the plight of migrants and the injustices they face, calling for kindness and humanitarian solutions. The pope shined a light on the suffering of those forced to emigrate due to injustice, who cross dangerous deserts and seas in search of a dignified life, only to encounter indifference. He prayed for God to comfort the suffering and called on people to show good will, specifically urging an end to conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and highlighting the plight of children suffering from war. Pope Francis also remembered those who have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea, placing a cross encircled by a life jacket inside the Vatican. He concluded his message with a plea to recognize and help those in need, emphasizing the importance of compassion and empathy during the Christmas season.
