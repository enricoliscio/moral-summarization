SUMMARY:
In his Christmas Day message, Pope Francis shed light on the suffering of migrants, urging kindness and a call to action to address the injustices that force them to flee their homes. He prayed for comfort and solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises, particularly in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa. The pontiff also called for an end to conflicts and persecution, and for governments to find solutions to allow people to live in peace and security. He emphasized the need to recognize the suffering around us and act to help those in need, softening "our often stony and self-centered hearts" and making them "channels of his love." END OF SUMMARY.
