Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Pope Francis's Christmas Day message. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that on Christmas Day, Pope Francis addressed migrants, emphasizing their suffering and calling for kindness. He spoke from St. Peter's Basilica, highlighting how injustice forces them to flee. The speech is titled "Urbi et Orbi," which means "to the city and the world." 

He prayed for those suffering and urged solutions to humanitarian crises. He specifically mentioned conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and prayed for those persecuted for their religion. He also mentioned his efforts to remember migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean by placing a cross with a life jacket in the Vatican. Additionally, he urged South Sudan leaders to form a coalition government for stability, which would allow him to visit in 2020.

The summary should include the main points: the address on Christmas Day, focus on migrants and their suffering, the title of the speech, calls for peace in various regions, and his symbolic gesture with the cross. Also, the part about South Sudan and his hope to visit. The conclusion is about recognizing suffering and acting to help.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, ensuring all key points are covered without too much detail. I'll structure it by mentioning the address, its focus on migrants, the title, the regions he mentioned, his symbolic gesture, the call for peace, and the conclusion about compassion.

Let me draft that. Make sure it's clear and flows well. Check the word count to stay within the limit. Maybe combine some sentences to save space. Also, ensure that all important regions and actions are included.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.
