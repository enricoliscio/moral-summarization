SUMMARY:
In his annual Christmas Day address, Pope Francis shone a light on the suffering of migrants around the world, urging kindness and a call to action to address the injustices that force them to flee their homes. He prayed for God's comfort to those who are suffering and called on people to show good will and find solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises. The Pope urged an end to conflicts in various regions and prayed for those who are persecuted on the basis of religion. He concluded his message with a call to recognize the suffering around us and act to help those in need, urging people to soften their "stony and self-centered hearts" and become channels of love and tenderness.
