SUMMARY:
In his annual Christmas Day address, Pope Francis shone a light on the suffering of migrants around the world, calling for kindness and an end to injustice. He urged people to show good will and find solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises, particularly in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa. The pontiff prayed for those persecuted on the basis of religion and for comfort to those suffering from war and conflicts. He also called for an end to conflicts and for governments to find solutions to allow people to live together in peace and security. Francis concluded his message with a call to recognize the suffering around us and act to help those in need, urging people to soften their hearts and become channels of love and tenderness.
