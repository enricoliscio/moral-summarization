SUMMARY: In his annual Christmas Day message, Pope Francis offered a message of hope and a call for kindness towards migrants worldwide. He shone a light on the suffering of those forced to emigrate due to injustices, such as indifference and conflict, that turn them away from places of potential dignity. The Pope prayed for comfort for the suffering and urged people to show good will, seeking solutions to ongoing crises. He highlighted the plight of children affected by war in the Middle East and other regions, and called for an end to hostilities in Syria. Pope Francis also drew attention to the migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea, placing a cross encircled by a life jacket inside the Vatican in their memory. His message emphasized the recognition of suffering and the need to act with tender hearts to help those in need, especially the abandoned, the elderly, migrants, and the marginalized. He concluded with a wish to brighten the darkness of the world with Christ's tenderness.
