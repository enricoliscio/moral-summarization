SUMMARY:

In his annual Christmas Day address, Pope Francis emphasized the need to address the suffering of migrants and refugees around the world. He called for kindness and compassion towards those forced to flee their homes due to injustice, conflict, and persecution. The Pope prayed for an end to conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and urged governments and the international community to find solutions to allow people to live together in peace and security. He also remembered the migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea, and urged leaders in South Sudan to uphold their commitment to form a coalition government. The Pope concluded his message by calling on people to recognize the suffering around them and act to help those in need, and to bring joy and tenderness to all, especially the marginalized and lonely.
