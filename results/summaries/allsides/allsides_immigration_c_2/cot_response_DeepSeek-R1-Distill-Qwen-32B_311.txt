Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article about Pope Francis's Christmas message. The user has specific instructions: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a concise summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. Pope Francis is addressing migrants, conflicts, and humanitarian issues. He uses strong moral language, so I need to pick out words that carry that weight.

Looking for words like "hope," "kindness," "protect," "sustain," "injustice," "emigrate," "secure," "deserts," "seas," "cemeteries," "indifference," "comfort," "good will," "humanitarian," "end," "persecuted," "light," "suffering," "war," "hostilities," "stability," "commitment," "coalition," "visit," "tenderness," "darkness."

Now, I'll list these words as per the user's first step. Each on a new line with a *.

Next, the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping the moral framing. I'll start by stating the main message: hope and kindness for migrants. Mention the injustices they face, the Pope's call for solutions, ending conflicts, and comforting those suffering. Include the cross with a life jacket symbolizing the migrants' plight. Also, mention the call to action for governments and individuals to help the marginalized. Conclude with the Pope's prayer for a brighter world.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it too long. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is covered succinctly.
