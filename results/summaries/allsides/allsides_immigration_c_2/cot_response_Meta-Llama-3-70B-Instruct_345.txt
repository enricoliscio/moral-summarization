SUMMARY:
In his annual Christmas Day address, Pope Francis shone a light on the suffering of migrants around the world, calling for kindness and an end to injustices that force them to flee their homes. He prayed for comfort and solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises, urging an end to conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa. The pontiff also called for recognition of the suffering around us and action to help those in need, urging leaders to show good will and find solutions to allow people to live together in peace and security. He concluded with a call to soften our "stony and self-centered hearts" and make them channels of love, tenderness, and kindness. END OF SUMMARY.
