Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article about Pope Francis's Christmas message and want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify the morally framed words and then write the summary.

First, I'll read through the article carefully. The key points are Pope Francis addressing migrants, calling for kindness, mentioning injustices leading to migration, and highlighting the suffering in various regions. He also talked about conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and prayed for those affected.

For the first step, I need to extract all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "hope," "kindness," "protect," "sustain," "injustice," "emigrate," "secure," "deserts," "seas," "cemeteries," "indifference," "comfort," "good will," "humanitarian," "end," "persecuted," "light," "suffering," "war," "hostilities," "stability," "commitment," "coalition," "visit," "tenderness," "darkness." I'll list these each on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, I'll craft a concise summary. I need to include the main points: the Christmas message, focus on migrants, injustices causing migration, prayer for peace, and Pope Francis's actions like placing a cross with a life jacket. I should keep the summary under 200 words and make sure to include as many of the moral words as possible without making it too wordy.

I'll start by mentioning the address and its title, then move on to the injustices and the call for kindness. I'll include the regions affected and the prayer for peace. Finally, I'll note the symbolic gesture and the overall message of hope and action.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and captures the essence of the article while emphasizing the moral aspects. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

He prayed for peace in conflict zones, including the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and called for an end to persecution based on religion.

Pope Francis also remembered migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean, placing a symbolic cross with a life jacket in the Vatican.
