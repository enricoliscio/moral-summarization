SUMMARY:

In his Christmas Day address, Pope Francis shone a light on the suffering of migrants worldwide, urging kindness and hope in the face of injustices. He prayed for God to comfort those suffering and called on people to show good will and find solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises. The pontiff condemned the injustices that force people to emigrate, crossing deserts and seas that become "cemeteries", and being turned away from places of hope by "walls of indifference". He prayed for an end to conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and for those persecuted on the basis of religion. Francis also remembered the migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea, calling for recognition of the suffering around us and action to help those in need. He concluded by praying for God to soften our hearts, bring tenderness to all, and brighten the darkness of the world.
