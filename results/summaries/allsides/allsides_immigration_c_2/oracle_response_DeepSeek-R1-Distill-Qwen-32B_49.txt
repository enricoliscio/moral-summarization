Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided and keep the summary under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Pope Francis addressed migrants' suffering, called for kindness, and prayed for solutions to conflicts. He mentioned injustices leading to emigration, highlighted the dangers they face, and urged governments to act.

I need to identify the key morally framed words: suffering, hope, kindness, injustices, emigrate, injustice, cross, turns, indifference, prayed, show, solutions, crises, end, persecuted, hostilities, live, peace, security, sufferings, drowned, abandoned, suffer, wear, give, heal, sick.

I'll structure the summary to include these words, ensuring it's concise. I'll start by stating the main message, then mention the injustices and sufferings, the call for kindness and solutions, and conclude with the prayer for peace.

I should avoid adding any new information not in the article and keep the tone consistent with the original moral framing. Let me draft the summary, making sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.
