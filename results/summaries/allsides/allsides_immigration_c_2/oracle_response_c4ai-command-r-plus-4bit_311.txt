SUMMARY: In his annual Christmas Day address, Pope Francis delivered a message of hope and kindness for migrants worldwide, shining a light on their suffering and the injustices they face. He prayed for those forced to emigrate in search of a secure life, crossing treacherous deserts and seas, only to be turned away or met with indifference. The Pope called for an end to conflicts and persecution, bringing peace and security to those in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, Africa, and elsewhere. He remembered the children suffering from war, the Syrian people enduring endless hostilities, and those persecuted for their religion. Pope Francis urged people to recognize and help those in need, comforting the abandoned, feeding the hungry, and healing the sick. He concluded with a plea to soften our stony hearts and make us channels of love and hope for the marginalized and suffering. His message, titled "Urbi et Orbi," serves as a reminder of our shared humanity and the importance of showing kindness and finding solutions to ongoing crises.
