SUMMARY:

In his annual Christmas Day address, Pope Francis shone a light on the suffering of migrants around the world, calling for kindness and hope in the face of injustices. He prayed for God to comfort those who are suffering and urged people to show good will and find solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises. The pontiff highlighted the injustices that force people to emigrate, crossing deserts and seas that become cemeteries, and facing walls of indifference. He called for an end to conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and prayed for those who are persecuted on the basis of religion. Francis also remembered the migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea, and urged leaders to uphold their commitments to form a coalition government. He concluded his message with a call to recognize the suffering around us and act to help those in need, praying for God to soften our hearts and make us channels of his love.
