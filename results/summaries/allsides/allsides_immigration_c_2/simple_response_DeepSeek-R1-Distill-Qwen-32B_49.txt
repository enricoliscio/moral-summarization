Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Pope Francis's Christmas message. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points.

Pope Francis addressed migrants, highlighting their suffering due to injustice. He mentioned deserts and seas becoming cemeteries, which is a strong moral statement against the dangers they face. He called for kindness and solutions to humanitarian crises, specifically mentioning conflicts in the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa. He also prayed for those persecuted for their religion.

He placed a cross with a life jacket in the Vatican, symbolizing the migrant deaths in the Mediterranean. He urged South Sudan leaders to form a coalition government for stability, hoping to visit there. The summary should include these points, emphasizing his moral call to action.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral aspects like injustice, kindness, and the need for global action. I'll structure it by mentioning his address, the injustices faced by migrants, the call for solutions, the symbolic gesture, and his hope for peace in various regions. Ending with his prayer for hearts to be channels of love ties it all together morally.
