Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Pope Francis's Christmas message. The user wants a concise summary of around 200 words. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Pope Francis addressing migrants' suffering during his Christmas speech. He mentions injustices forcing people to emigrate and compares deserts and seas to cemeteries. The speech is titled "Urbi et Orbi," which means to the city and the world. He prays for those suffering and calls for kindness and solutions to crises.

He also urges peace in regions like the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa. Specifically, he mentions Syria and children affected by war. Earlier, he placed a cross with a life jacket in the Vatican to remember migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean. He also called on South Sudan leaders to form a coalition government for stability, hoping to visit there in 2020.

The summary should include key points: the message of hope for migrants, mention of injustices leading to emigration, the speech title, prayer for peace, specific regions mentioned, the cross with a life jacket, and the call to action for governments. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main elements without getting too detailed.

I should structure it to first introduce the Pope's message, then the main points he addressed, including the title, prayer for peace, mention of specific regions, the symbolic cross, and the call to action. Conclude with his hope for a better world through collective action.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's concise. I'll make sure each sentence covers a key point without unnecessary details. Also, I'll use clear and direct language to convey the message effectively.

Finally, I'll start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions. Making sure the summary flows well and captures all essential aspects of the Pope's address.
