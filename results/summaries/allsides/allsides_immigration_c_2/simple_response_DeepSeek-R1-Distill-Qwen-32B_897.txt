Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Pope Francis's Christmas message. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Pope Francis addressing migrants, calling for kindness and hope. He mentions injustices forcing people to emigrate, crossing dangerous paths, and the walls of indifference. The speech is titled "Urbi et Orbi," which means to the city and the world. He prays for those suffering, urges ending conflicts in several regions, and mentions his symbolic act with the cross and life jacket. He also calls for governments and the international community to find solutions. The summary needs to be under 200 words and include these elements.

I should start by stating the main action: Pope Francis's Christmas message. Then, highlight the main moral points: migrants' suffering, injustices, call for kindness, and specific regions affected. Mention his symbolic gesture and the broader call to action. Keep it concise but cover all essential moral aspects.

I'll structure it by first introducing the message, then the key moral appeals, followed by his symbolic act, and conclude with the broader call for action. Make sure to include the title of the speech and the regions he mentioned. Also, note his prayer for peace and the need for collective action.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent, concise summary that captures the moral framing without exceeding 200 words.
