SUMMARY:

In his Christmas Day address, Pope Francis shone a light on the suffering of migrants around the world, urging kindness and hope in the face of injustice. He prayed for God to comfort those who are suffering, and called on people to show good will and find solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises. The Pope lamented the injustices that force people to emigrate, often leading to tragic consequences, such as drowning in the Mediterranean Sea. He urged an end to conflicts in various regions, including the Middle East, Latin America, Ukraine, and Africa, and prayed for those who are persecuted on the basis of religion. The Pope's message emphasized the need for peace, security, and an end to hostilities, so that people can live together in dignity. He concluded by calling on individuals to recognize the suffering around them and act to help those in need, softening "our often stony and self-centered hearts" and making them "channels of his love."
