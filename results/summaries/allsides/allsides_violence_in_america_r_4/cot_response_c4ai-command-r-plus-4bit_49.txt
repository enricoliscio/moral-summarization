SUMMARY:
An extreme incident of rioting in Minnesota left 21 police officers with significant injuries and resulted in the arrests of over 100 protesters. The protests, which started as a peaceful march against recent police killings of black men, turned violent when protesters pelted officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices. The acts of violence disgusted St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell, who expressed hope and prayers for a peaceful night ahead while condemning the unacceptable levels of violence towards public servants. The Minnesota State Patrol worked hand-in-hand with St. Paul police to clear the interstate, which had been blocked by protesters throwing debris at officers. The governor of Minnesota met with the family and friends of one of the victims, and the families of both victims denounced the attack on the Dallas officers. The protests and riots in Minnesota reflected the nation's outrage over police killings of black men and the targeting of white cops in Dallas.
