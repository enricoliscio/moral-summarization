SUMMARY:
In a disgusting display of violence, more than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota during a riot that stemmed from protests over recent police killings of black men. Protesters pelted officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, resulting in significant injuries. Refusing to disassemble, protesters blocked Interstate 94, with some even throwing bottles, rocks, and fireworks at officers, including one aimed at an officer's face. The violent acts were denounced by both the police and the families of the victims of police killings. Police responded with smoke bombs and more than 100 troopers, working hand-in-hand with St. Paul police, to clear the freeway and restore peace. The Minnesota governor also met with the family of one of the victims. Police chiefs expressed their disgust at the extreme acts of violence and their hope for a more peaceful night in the future.
END OF SUMMARY.
