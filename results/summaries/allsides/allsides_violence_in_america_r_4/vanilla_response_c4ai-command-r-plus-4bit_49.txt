SUMMARY: Protests over the recent police killings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana turned violent on Saturday night, resulting in the arrest of over 100 people and injuries to 21 police officers. The protesters pelted officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper. Police in Minnesota used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and more than 100 troopers worked with St. Paul police to clear the freeway. St. Paul's mayor and police chief condemned the violence and emphasized that it was an isolated incident, with the majority of protests being peaceful. Minnesota's governor met with the family of Philando Castile, one of the black men killed by police, and the families of both Castile and Alton Sterling denounced the attack on the Dallas officers. The injured officers are expected to recover, and authorities hope for peaceful protests in the coming nights.
