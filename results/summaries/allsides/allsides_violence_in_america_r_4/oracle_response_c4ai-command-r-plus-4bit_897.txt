SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota after protests over the recent police killings of black men turned into rioting. St. Paul's mayor, Chris Coleman, described the events as an "extreme incident," with protesters pelting officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices. The protests were sparked by the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, who were shot by police officers during separate incidents. Just days earlier, five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper, leading to heightened tensions. The Minnesota protests, which began with a march from the governor's mansion, resulted in the arrests of over 100 individuals. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and officers in riot gear moved in to restore order. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the violence directed toward officers and vowed not to tolerate such acts. The Minnesota State Patrol also responded to the riots, but their efforts to keep protesters off the freeway were unsuccessful. The protests highlight the ongoing tensions between law enforcement and communities of color, with calls for justice and accountability in the wake of police killings.
END OF SUMMARY.
