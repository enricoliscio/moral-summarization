SUMMARY:

Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned violent. The protests, which began with a peaceful march, escalated into rioting with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, at police officers. The injuries to officers were significant but not life-threatening. The riots came just days after the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, and the murder of five Dallas police officers. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and over 100 troopers responded to the freeway. The interstate reopened at around 1:30 a.m. Sunday. Authorities denounced the violence, with St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell saying he was "disgusted" by the acts of some people.
