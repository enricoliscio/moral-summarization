SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned into rioting. The protests, which started with a march from the governor's mansion, were among several demonstrations nationwide following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers. Despite the efforts of police to clear the demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, the protests turned violent with protesters pelting officers with rocks and incendiary devices. The injuries to the officers were significant but not life-threatening. St. Paul's mayor, Chris Coleman, described the incident as "extreme," and police chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the acts of violence, vowing not to tolerate them. The previous protests had been peaceful, but Saturday night's protest turned ugly with protesters refusing to listen to police and resorting to violence. The interstate was reopened in the early hours of Sunday morning. This comes just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered in a sniper attack. The families of Castile and Sterling denounced the attack on the Dallas officers.
END OF SUMMARY.
