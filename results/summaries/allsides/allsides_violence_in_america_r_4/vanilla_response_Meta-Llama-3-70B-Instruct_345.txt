SUMMARY:

Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned violent. The protests, which began with a peaceful march, escalated into rioting with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, at police officers. The injuries to officers were significant but not life-threatening. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and about 200 protesters refused to leave the roadway. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered in a sniper attack. The families of the victims, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, denounced the attack on the Dallas officers. Authorities condemned the violence, with St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell saying he was "disgusted" by the acts of some people.
