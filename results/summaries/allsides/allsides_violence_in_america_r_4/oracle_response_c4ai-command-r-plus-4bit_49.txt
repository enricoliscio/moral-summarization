SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned into rioting. St. Paul's mayor, Chris Coleman, described the events as an "extreme incident", with protesters pelting police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices such as Molotov cocktails. The injuries to the officers were significant but not life-threatening. The protests, which began with a march from the governor's mansion, were sparked by the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers in separate incidents. Just days earlier, five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper, Micah Johnson, who targeted white cops. In Minnesota, police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking a highway, but some protesters refused to leave and turned violent, throwing objects at officers. The police chief, Todd Axtell, expressed disgust at the acts of violence and passed around a bent police badge, damaged by a rock, to reporters. The Minnesota State Patrol chief, Matt Langer, noted that previous protests had been peaceful and compliant, but Saturday night's protesters would not listen and turned violent. More than 100 troopers responded to the freeway, and the interstate was reopened in the early hours of Sunday morning.
END OF SUMMARY.
