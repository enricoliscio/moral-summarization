SUMMARY:

Protests over recent police killings of black men in Minnesota turned violent on Saturday night, resulting in 102 arrests and 21 injured police officers. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman described the incident as "extreme" and condemned the actions of protesters who pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. The protests, which began with a peaceful march, escalated into rioting, with demonstrators refusing to leave the roadway and police using smoke bombs to clear them. The violence was strongly condemned by authorities, with St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressing disgust and vowing not to tolerate such behavior. The incident occurred just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered in a sniper attack, and the families of the victims of police killings denounced the attack on the Dallas officers. The moral framing of this incident is one of condemnation of violence and a call for peaceful protest.
