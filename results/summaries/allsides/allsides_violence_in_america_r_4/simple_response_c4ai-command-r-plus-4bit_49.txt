SUMMARY: Rioting and violence marred protests against police killings of black men in Minnesota on Saturday night, resulting in 102 arrests and injuries to 21 police officers. The protests, which started with a march from the governor's mansion, turned violent when protesters threw rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices at police officers. This is a stark contrast to previous protests, which were peaceful and cooperative with police. The rioting came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper targeting white cops, and the families of the black men killed in Minnesota and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, denounced the attack. The violence in Minnesota resulted in significant injuries to police officers, with the St. Paul police chief calling it an "extreme incident" and expressing disgust at the actions of some protesters. The Minnesota governor also met with the family of one of the black men killed in a police shooting. The protest turned violent when demonstrators blocked a freeway and threw objects at officers, leading to arrests and the use of smoke bombs by police to clear the roadway. One protester described the scene as mostly peaceful, with officers warning protesters of arrests if they didn't disassemble. Another protester recounted being pepper-sprayed by an officer. This incident highlights the tragic cycle of violence and retaliation that has plagued recent protests against police brutality.
