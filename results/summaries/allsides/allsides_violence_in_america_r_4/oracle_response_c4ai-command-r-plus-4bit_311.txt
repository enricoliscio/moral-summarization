SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota during protests over recent police killings of black men that morphed into rioting. Protesters pelted officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, leading to a violent clash that left officers with significant injuries. The protests, which started with a march from the governor's mansion, were sparked by the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers in separate incidents. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper targeting white cops. In Minnesota, police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking a freeway, but protesters turned violent, throwing bottles, rocks, and other objects at officers. The police chief expressed disgust at the acts of violence and refused to tolerate such behavior. The interstate was eventually reopened, but the impact of the rioting left a lasting impression on law enforcement. One protester described being pepper-sprayed by an officer, despite his attempts to keep the peace. The governor met with Castile's family, but details of their conversation remain undisclosed.
END OF SUMMARY.
