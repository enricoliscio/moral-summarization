SUMMARY:
In Minnesota, a protest against recent police killings of black men turned into a riot, resulting in 102 arrests and 21 injured police officers. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman described the incident as "extreme" and "significant". The protesters, who were mostly peaceful, refused to leave the roadway, prompting police to use smoke bombs to clear them. However, some protesters turned violent, throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, at police officers. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell was "disgusted" by the acts of violence and said that the police would not tolerate it. The previous protests were peaceful, but Saturday night's protesters would not listen to police, leading to a violent confrontation. The interstate was eventually reopened, and the governor met with the family and friends of one of the victims in a "cordial" meeting.
END OF SUMMARY.
