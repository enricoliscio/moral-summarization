SUMMARY:

Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned into rioting. The "extreme incident" saw protesters pelt police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, resulting in "significant" injuries to officers. The protests, which started with a peaceful march, were among several demonstrations nationwide following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, who were shot by police officers. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by Micah Johnson in a sniper attack. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, but were unsuccessful in keeping protesters from going on the freeway. The violence towards police officers was condemned by authorities, with St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell saying he was "disgusted" by the acts of some people and adding, "we're not going to tolerate it."
