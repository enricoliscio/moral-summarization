SUMMARY:

A violent incident in Minnesota resulted in 102 arrests and 21 police officers injured, with injuries described as "significant, but none were life-threatening." The protests, sparked by the recent police killings of black men Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, turned into rioting as demonstrators pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. The attacks on police officers were condemned by Sterling's and Castile's families, who denounced the murder of five Dallas police officers by Micah Johnson. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the violent acts, stating that police would not tolerate such behavior. The protests, which began peacefully, turned violent as demonstrators refused to leave the roadway, blocking Interstate 94. Police used smoke bombs to clear the area, and more than 100 troopers responded to the freeway. The incident was widely condemned, with authorities hoping for a peaceful resolution.
