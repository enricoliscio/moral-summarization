SUMMARY:

A protest in Minnesota turned violent on Saturday night, resulting in 102 arrests and 21 injured police officers. The protest, which began as a peaceful march, escalated into rioting with demonstrators throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, at police officers. The violence is a stark contrast to the peaceful protests that had taken place in the past, with police officers expressing disgust and disappointment at the actions of some protesters. The protest was one of several nationwide following the deaths of two black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, at the hands of police officers. The families of the two men denounced the attack on Dallas police officers last week. The incident highlights the need for peaceful and respectful protests, and for police officers to be able to perform their duties without fear of violence.
