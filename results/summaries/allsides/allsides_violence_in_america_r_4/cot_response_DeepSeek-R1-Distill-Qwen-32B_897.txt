Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down.

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about protests in Minnesota that turned violent, leading to arrests and injuries. There are mentions of police officers being attacked with rocks and Molotov cocktails. The protests were sparked by the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, both black men killed by police. Also, there's the recent attack on Dallas police officers, which adds context.

Next, the user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words. I need to look for words that carry moral connotations, like "arrested," "injured," "protests," "rioting," "pelted," "extreme incident," "violence," "targeted," "condemned," "disgusted," "public servants," "nonviolent," "peaceful," "condemned," "attack," "unrest," "tolerate," "public servants," "violence," "peaceful," "condemned," "attack," "unrest," "tolerate," "public servants," "violence," "peaceful," "condemned," "attack," "unrest," "tolerate," "public servants," "violence," "peaceful."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these moral words as possible. I should mention the arrests, injuries, the shift from protest to riot, the projectiles used, the context of the police killings, the families' statements, the police response with smoke bombs, the unsuccessful attempts to control the crowd, the badge bent from a rock, the police's disgust, and the overall violence. I should also include the governor's meeting and the protester's experience with pepper spray.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. I'll start by stating the main event, then the causes, the reactions, and the consequences. I'll use the morally framed words to highlight the tensions and conflicts.

Let me draft the summary: It should mention the 102 arrests, 21 injured officers, the shift to rioting, the projectiles, the context of the killings, the families' statements, the police response, the unsuccessful containment, the badge incident, the disgust, the hope for peace, and the governor's meeting.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing. I'll make sure it's concise and under 200 words.
