Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about protests in Minnesota that turned into riots. Over 100 people were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured. They used rocks, rebar, and even Molotov cocktails. The protests were because of the police killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The riots happened just after the Dallas police officers were killed by Micah Johnson. The police used smoke bombs and riot gear. Some protesters were violent, and the police were really upset about it. The governor met with Castile's family. I should include the main points: the number of arrests and injuries, the cause of the protests, the violence used, the police response, and the context of recent events. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me structure it: start with the event, then the cause, the violence, police response, and the aftermath. Make sure to mention the two black men killed by police and the link to the Dallas incident. Also, include the police's reaction and the reopening of the freeway. I think that covers the key points without going into too much detail. Now, I'll put it all together in a clear, concise summary.
