SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota during protests that morphed into rioting. St. Paul's mayor called the events an “extreme incident,” and detailed how protesters pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, resulting in significant injuries. The protests were sparked by recent police killings of black men, including Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, and came just days after the murder of five Dallas police officers by a sniper. The riots in Minnesota led to the arrest of over 100 individuals who refused to leave the interstate freeway when ordered by police. Police used smoke bombs to clear the demonstrators, and officers were subjected to violence, with one officer's badge being bent from the impact of a rock. Minnesota's governor met with Castile's family and friends, but details of the conversation were not disclosed. The protests in Minnesota turned violent, with bottles, rocks, and other debris being thrown at officers, but the previous protests had been peaceful. The police chief expressed disgust at the acts of violence and vowed not to tolerate such behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
