SUMMARY: Protests over the recent police killings of black men in Minnesota turned violent on Saturday night, resulting in the arrest of over 100 people and injuries to 21 police officers. The protesters pelted police with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, in what St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman described as an "extreme incident." This riot occurred just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper, Micah Johnson, who targeted white cops. The Minnesota protests, which started with a march from the governor's mansion, were among several demonstrations nationwide following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers. Despite the efforts of law enforcement, the protesters turned violent, refusing to leave the roadway and throwing objects at officers. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the actions of the rioters, noting that he had never seen this level of violence toward public servants in his 28 years of service. The acts of these violent protesters are reprehensible and only serve to undermine the legitimate grievances and peaceful demonstrations of those protesting racial injustice in policing. We must find a way to address police brutality without endangering the lives of innocent officers who are just doing their jobs and seeking to protect the public.
END OF SUMMARY.
