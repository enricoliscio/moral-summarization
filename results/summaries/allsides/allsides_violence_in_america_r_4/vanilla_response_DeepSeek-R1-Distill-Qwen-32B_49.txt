Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about protests in Minnesota that turned violent. Over 100 people were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured. The protests were over the police killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The protesters threw rocks, rebar, and even Molotov cocktails. The police used smoke bombs and riot gear to control the crowd.

I should note the key points: the number of arrests and injuries, the reasons behind the protests, the violent actions by protesters, and the police response. Also, mention the context of recent events like the Dallas police attack and the governor's meeting with Castile's family.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it clearly. Make sure to include the main events and the impact of the violence on the police. Highlight the police chief's disgust and the reopening of the freeway. Also, mention the mixed reactions from protesters, some peaceful and others violent.

I'll start by stating the main event: protests over police killings leading to arrests and injuries. Then explain the causes, the violent tactics, police response, and the aftermath. Conclude with the hope for better nights and the context of recent national events.

Make sure the summary flows logically, covering all essential points without getting too detailed. Avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.
