Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about protests in Minnesota. The user provided the article and specified the format for the summary, which should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about protests in St. Paul, Minnesota, where over 100 people were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured. The protests were in response to the police killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The situation turned violent, with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails. The police used smoke bombs to control the crowd.

I should note the key details: the number of arrests and injuries, the reasons behind the protests, the violent tactics used, and the police response. Also, it's important to mention the context of other recent police-related incidents, like the Dallas attack, to give a complete picture.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, covering all these points without going over 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event, then the causes, the violence, the police response, and the context of other incidents. I'll keep each sentence brief and to the point.

I should also check if there are any specific names or numbers that are important, like the mayor's name, the police chief's name, and the number of officers injured. Including these adds credibility and specificity to the summary.

Finally, I'll structure the summary in a logical flow: start with the event, explain the causes, describe the violence, mention the police actions, and conclude with the broader context. That should cover all the necessary information succinctly.

SUMMARY: Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in St. Paul, Minnesota, during violent protests over recent police killings of black men, including Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. Protesters threw rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails at officers, leading to the use of smoke bombs to disperse the crowd. The protests began peacefully but turned violent, with some protesters refusing to leave the freeway. Police expressed disgust at the violence, describing it as the worst they've seen in decades. The unrest followed the deaths of Castile and Sterling, and came days after five Dallas police officers were killed by a sniper. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton met with Castile's family, but the meeting's details were not disclosed. The interstate was reopened early Sunday after the violent clashes. END OF SUMMARY.
