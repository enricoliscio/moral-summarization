SUMMARY:
More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned into rioting. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman described the events as an “extreme incident” where protesters pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices. Twenty-one officers suffered significant injuries. The protests began with a march from the governor's mansion and were among several demonstrations nationwide following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers. In Minnesota, police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, but about 200 protesters refused to leave the roadway and met police in riot gear with violence. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the acts of some protesters, noting that this level of violence toward public servants was unprecedented in his 28 years of service. Minnesota troopers attempted to maintain peace but struggled to control the violent protesters, who threw bottles, rocks, and other objects at officers. More than 100 troopers worked alongside St. Paul police to clear the freeway, and the interstate was reopened in the early hours of Sunday morning. The governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, met with Castile's family and friends earlier on Saturday, and the families of both Sterling and Castile denounced the attack on police officers in Dallas.
