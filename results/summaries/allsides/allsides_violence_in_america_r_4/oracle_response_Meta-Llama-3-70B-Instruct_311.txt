SUMMARY:

Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned into rioting. The "extreme incident" saw protesters pelt police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, causing "significant" injuries to officers. The protests, which started with a peaceful march, were part of nationwide demonstrations following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, who were shot by police officers. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered in a sniper attack. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, but about 200 protesters refused to leave, leading to violent clashes. Authorities condemned the "acts of violence" and vowed not to "tolerate" such behavior. The night's events left many "disgusted" and praying for a better night ahead.
