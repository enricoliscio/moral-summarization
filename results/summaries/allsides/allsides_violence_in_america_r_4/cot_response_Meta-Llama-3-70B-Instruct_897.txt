SUMMARY:
A night of protests in Minnesota turned into an "extreme incident" of rioting, leaving 21 police officers injured and over 100 people arrested. The protests, sparked by the recent police killings of two black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, began peacefully but escalated into violence. Protesters pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, leading to "significant" injuries. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed his disgust at the acts of violence, saying "we're not going to tolerate it." The police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and eventually reopened the freeway at 1:30 a.m. Sunday. While some protesters described the event as mostly "peaceful," others reported being pepper-sprayed by officers. The incident came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered in a sniper attack, which was denounced by the families of Castile and Sterling. END OF SUMMARY.
