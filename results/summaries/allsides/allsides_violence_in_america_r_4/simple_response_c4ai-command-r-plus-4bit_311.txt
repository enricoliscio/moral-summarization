SUMMARY: Violence erupted in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned into rioting, resulting in the arrest of over 100 people and injuries to 21 police officers. The protesters pelted officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. These protests add to the growing unrest across the nation following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers. Despite the denouncement of the Dallas police officers' attack by Sterling's and Castile's families, the riots in Minnesota resulted in significant injuries to officers and the use of smoke bombs to clear demonstrators. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed his disgust at the violent actions of the protesters, emphasizing that such behavior would not be tolerated. The Minnesota State Patrol also noted that the previous protests had been peaceful, but Saturday night's protesters turned violent and refused to listen to authorities. The interstate was eventually reopened in the early hours of Sunday, but the tension and unrest continue to linger. This incident highlights the escalating tensions between communities and law enforcement, with protesters demanding justice and accountability for the deaths of Castile and Sterling. END OF SUMMARY.
