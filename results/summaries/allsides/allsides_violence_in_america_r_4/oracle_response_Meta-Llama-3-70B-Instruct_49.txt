SUMMARY: 

Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned violent. The "extreme incident" saw protesters pelt police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, causing "significant" injuries. The protests, which started peacefully, were among several nationwide demonstrations following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by Micah Johnson in a sniper attack. Sterling's and Castile's families denounced the attack on the Dallas officers. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, but about 200 protesters refused to leave, leading to arrests. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell was "disgusted" by the acts of violence towards officers, saying "we're not going to tolerate it." The interstate reopened at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday.
