Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about protests in Minnesota turning violent, leading to over 100 arrests and injuries to police officers. It mentions the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, which sparked the protests. There's also a reference to the recent attack on Dallas police officers, which the families of Castile and Sterling condemned. The police response involved using smoke bombs and riot gear, and the protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. Some people were peaceful, but others turned violent. The police chief expressed disgust and emphasized that such violence won't be tolerated.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key points: the protests, the violence, the arrests, the police response, and the moral implications. I should mention the deaths of Castile and Sterling as the cause, the shift from peaceful to violent protests, the police's use of force, and the reactions from officials and protesters.

I should also highlight the moral framing, which seems to be around the excessive force by protesters and the police's response. The author presents the police as public servants being attacked, and the protesters' violence as unacceptable.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll start with the main event: protests over police killings leading to violence. Then mention the arrests and injuries. Include the causes (Castile and Sterling's deaths), the shift to riots, the police's use of smoke bombs, the protesters' violent actions, the police chief's disgust, and the overall tension.

I should avoid getting bogged down in details like specific names unless necessary. Focus on the main points and the moral perspective presented.

Let me structure it: start with the protests, the violence, the numbers, causes, police response, and the moral stance against violence. Make sure to mention the peaceful protesters too, to show it wasn't all violence, but the majority turned violent.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's concise and captures the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Protests in Minnesota over recent police killings of black men, including Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, escalated into violent riots, resulting in 102 arrests and injuries to 21 police officers. Protesters threw rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails at officers, who responded with smoke bombs and riot gear. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the violence, calling it the worst he'd seen in 28 years. While some protesters remained peaceful, others turned violent, leading to clashes with law enforcement. The protests followed the deaths of Castile and Sterling and came days after five Dallas police officers were killed. Gov. Mark Dayton met with Castile's family, but the situation remained tense as violence overshadowed the demonstrations. END OF SUMMARY.
