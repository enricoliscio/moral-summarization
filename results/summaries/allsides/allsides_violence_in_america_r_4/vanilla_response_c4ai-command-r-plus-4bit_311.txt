SUMMARY: Protests in Minnesota over recent police killings of black men turned violent on Saturday night, resulting in the arrest of over 100 people and injuries to 21 police officers. St. Paul's mayor, Chris Coleman, described the events as "extreme," with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices at officers. Police responded with smoke bombs and riot gear, eventually clearing the interstate of protesters. The protests were sparked by the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers in separate incidents. The riots occurred just days after a sniper attack in Dallas that targeted white police officers, killing five. Minnesota's governor, Mark Dayton, met with Castile's family and friends earlier on Saturday. St. Paul's police chief, Todd Axtell, expressed disgust at the violence and vowed not to tolerate it. Minnesota State Patrol also noted that previous protests had been peaceful, but Saturday's protesters refused to listen to police and turned violent. The interstate was reopened in the early hours of Sunday. One protester, Misty Macon, described the protest as mostly peaceful, while another, Mike Martin, claimed he was pepper-sprayed by an officer while trying to keep the peace.
END OF SUMMARY.
