Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. 

So, the article is about protests in Minnesota that turned into riots. Over 100 people were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured. The protests were over the police killings of black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The police were hit with rocks, rebar, and even Molotov cocktails. The mayor called it an extreme incident.

I should include the key points: the number of arrests, injuries, who was involved, the reasons behind the protests, and the response from the police. Also, mention the context of other recent events, like the Dallas police attack, and the governor's meeting.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, making sure to cover all important details without going into too much detail.

First, the main event: protests turning violent in Minnesota. Then the numbers: 102 arrests, 21 officers injured. The reasons: police killings of Castile and Sterling. The violent methods used by protesters. The police response with smoke bombs and riot gear. The context of recent national events, including Dallas. The governor's meeting with Castile's family. And the police chief's reaction.

I should also note that while some protesters were peaceful, others turned violent. The interstate closure and reopening. 

Let me make sure to include all these points succinctly.
