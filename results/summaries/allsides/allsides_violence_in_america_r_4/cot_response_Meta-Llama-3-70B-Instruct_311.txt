SUMMARY:
A riot broke out in Minnesota on Saturday night, resulting in over 100 arrests and 21 police officers injured. The "extreme incident" was sparked by protests over recent police killings of black men, including Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. Protesters pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, leading to "significant" injuries. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed his disgust at the acts of violence, stating that it was the first time in his 28 years as a police officer that he had observed such a level of violence towards public servants. Despite previous peaceful protests, Saturday night's protesters turned violent, throwing bottles and rocks at officers. The police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and eventually reopened the freeway at 1:30 a.m. Sunday. The incident was a stark contrast to the "cordial" meeting between Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton and the family and friends of Castile earlier that day. END OF SUMMARY.
