SUMMARY:

In Minnesota, a protest over recent police killings of black men turned violent, resulting in 102 arrests and 21 police officers injured. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman described the event as an "extreme incident" where protesters pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. The injuries to officers were "significant, but none were life-threatening." The protests followed the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, who were shot by police officers. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by Micah Johnson in a sniper attack. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and about 200 protesters refused to leave the roadway. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell said he was "disgusted" by the acts of some people and added, "we're not going to tolerate it." The violence towards police officers was unprecedented, with protesters throwing bottles, rocks, and other debris at officers.
