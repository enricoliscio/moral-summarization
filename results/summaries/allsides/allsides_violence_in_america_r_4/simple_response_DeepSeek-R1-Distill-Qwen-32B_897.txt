Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about protests in Minnesota turning violent, leading to arrests and injured officers. It mentions the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, which sparked nationwide demonstrations. There's also a reference to the Dallas police officers being killed, which adds context to the tensions.

I should note the specific details: 102 arrests, 21 injured officers, use of Molotov cocktails, and the police response with smoke bombs. The police chiefs' reactions are importantâ€”they're expressing disgust and frustration. Also, some protesters claim the situation was peaceful, but others turned violent.

I need to maintain the moral framing, which seems to highlight the violence and the breakdown of peaceful protest. The article contrasts the peaceful past protests with the violent actions on Saturday night. The families of the deceased men denouncing the violence adds another layer of moral judgment.

I should structure the summary to include the main events, the causes (police killings), the violent actions, the police response, and the moral stance against the violence. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

Let me outline the points:

1. Protests over police killings of black men turned violent in Minnesota.
2. 102 arrests, 21 officers injured, use of incendiary devices.
3. Context: deaths of Castile and Sterling, recent Dallas attack.
4. Police response with smoke bombs, failure to disperse.
5. Mayor and police chiefs' statements of disgust.
6. Some protesters claim peaceful intent, others turned violent.
7. Families denouncing violence.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all these points while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the article.
