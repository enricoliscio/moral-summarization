Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and the underlying moral perspectives.

The article talks about protests in Minnesota turning violent, leading to over 100 arrests and injuries to police officers. It mentions the context of recent police killings of black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. There's also a reference to the Dallas police officers being killed by Micah Johnson, which adds another layer of tension. The mayor and police chief express disgust at the violence, and there are differing accounts from protesters about the peacefulness of the event.

I need to capture the moral aspects, like the frustration leading to violence, the police's perspective on the violence against them, and the contrast between the majority's peaceful intentions and the actions of a few. I should also include the context of the recent killings to set the scene.

I'll start by outlining the key points: protests over police killings, violence erupting, arrests and injuries, police using smoke bombs, the police chief's disgust, and the context of recent events. I'll make sure to mention both the violent actions and the peaceful intentions to show the moral conflict.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll condense each section, ensuring that the moral framing is clear. For example, highlighting that while many intended to protest peacefully, the actions of some led to violence, which the police and officials condemned.

I should also mention the aftermath, like the reopening of the freeway and the meeting with the governor, to show the ongoing efforts despite the violence. This adds to the moral narrative of the situation's complexity.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure each sentence flows logically and covers all necessary points without exceeding the word limit. I'll check for clarity and ensure that the moral elements are prominent.

SUMMARY: Protests in Minnesota over recent police killings of black men, including Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, escalated into violence, resulting in 102 arrests and injuries to 21 police officers. Protesters threw rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails, leading to the use of smoke bombs by police to disperse the crowd. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the violence, calling it the worst he’d seen in 28 years. While some protesters claimed the event was mostly peaceful, others turned violent, throwing debris at officers. The protests followed the deaths of Castile and Sterling and came days after five Dallas police officers were killed by Micah Johnson. Gov. Mark Dayton met with Castile’s family, but the situation remained tense as violence overshadowed the initial peaceful intent. END OF SUMMARY.
