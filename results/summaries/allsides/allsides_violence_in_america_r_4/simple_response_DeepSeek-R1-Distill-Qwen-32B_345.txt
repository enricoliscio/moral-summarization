Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first. It's about protests in Minnesota turning violent, leading to arrests and injuries. The protests were sparked by police killings of black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. There's also mention of the Dallas police attack, which the families of the victims condemned. 

The article details the events: protesters throwing rocks, rebar, Molotov cocktails, police using smoke bombs, and the arrest of over 100 people. The police chief is disgusted by the violence, and there's a mention of a badge bent from a rock impact. The summary needs to capture the moral aspects, so I should highlight the tension between protest and violence, the police response, and the context of recent police killings.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the protests, the violence, the arrests, the police reaction, and the broader context of racial issues. I'll make sure to mention the specific incidents and the moral implications without getting too bogged down in details. 

Let me structure it: start with the protests turning violent, mention the number of arrests and injuries, describe the violence used by protesters, the police response, the police chief's reaction, and tie it back to the broader context of recent police killings and the attack in Dallas. Also, include that the families condemned the violence. 

I should avoid taking sides but present the moral framing as the author did, which seems to focus on the violence against police and the disruption caused by the protests. I'll make sure to include the contrast between the peaceful start and the violent escalation. 

Now, putting it all together concisely. Make sure each sentence adds value and doesn't exceed the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go. Okay, that should cover it.

SUMMARY: Protests in Minnesota over recent police killings of black men turned violent, resulting in 102 arrests and 21 police injuries. Protesters threw rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails at officers, with St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell calling the violence "unprecedented" in his 28 years on the force. The protests began peacefully but escalated after demonstrators blocked Interstate 94 and refused to disperse. Police used smoke bombs to clear the area. The violence followed the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police, and came days after five Dallas officers were murdered by a gunman. Sterling's and Castile's families condemned the attack on the Dallas officers. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton met with Castile's family, though no details of the conversation were shared. The protests highlighted tensions over racial injustice and police violence, with some protesters expressing frustration over the aggressive police response. END OF SUMMARY.
