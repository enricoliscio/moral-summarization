SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota during protests against recent police killings of black men. The protests started with a march from the governor's mansion and turned violent when protesters pelted police with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices. The injuries to officers were significant but not life-threatening. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and the freeway reopened around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday. St. Paul's mayor called the incident extreme and the police chief said he was disgusted by the violence. Minnesota's governor met with the family and friends of Philando Castile, a black man killed by police in a recent traffic stop, at the governor's mansion on Saturday. The protests in Minnesota were among several demonstrations nationwide following the deaths of Castile and Alton Sterling, a black man killed by police in Baton Rouge. The riots came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper targeting white cops.
END OF SUMMARY.
