Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about protests in Minnesota that turned violent, leading to arrests and injuries. They also mentioned the context of recent police killings of black men, which adds a moral dimension.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. These are words that carry a strong emotional or ethical connotation. Let me go through the article again. Words like "arrested," "injured," "protests," "police killings," "black men," "rioting," "extreme incident," "pelted," "rocks," "rebar," "incendiary devices," "Molotov cocktails," "significant," "life-threatening," "demonstrations," "deaths," "shot," "scuffle," "families denounced," "attack," "violence," "public servants," "disgusted," "unsuccessful," "peaceful," "protester," "firework," "pepper-sprayed," "cordial." These words all carry moral weight, so I'll list them as per the user's instruction.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the number of arrests and injuries, then the cause of the protestsâ€”police killings of black men. I'll note the extreme incident, the use of weapons against police, the injuries, and the context of recent events like the Dallas attack. I'll include the police's response with smoke bombs, the protesters' refusal to leave, the police's disgust, and the reopening of the freeway. I'll also mention the mostly peaceful protest with some violence, the pepper-spraying incident, and the meeting with the governor. I'll make sure to include all the key points and maintain the moral framing throughout.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all the important aspects without being too lengthy. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, I'll use the morally framed words to convey the gravity and emotions involved in the events.

**SUMMARY:**  
More than 100 people were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured in Minnesota during protests over recent police killings of black men. The protests, which began peacefully, escalated into rioting as demonstrators threw rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails at officers. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman called the incident "extreme," with injuries to officers described as "significant but not life-threatening." The protests followed the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police, and came days after five Dallas police officers were murdered. Police used smoke bombs to disperse protesters blocking Interstate 94, but some demonstrators refused to leave, leading to violence. Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the level of violence, calling it the worst he had seen in his 28 years on the job. The interstate reopened after midnight, but tensions remained high as some protesters continued to clash with police. Gov. Mark Dayton met with Castile's family, though the conversation's details were not disclosed. END OF SUMMARY.
