SUMMARY:

In Minnesota, a protest against recent police killings of black men turned violent, resulting in 102 arrests and 21 injured police officers. The protest, which started as a peaceful march, escalated into rioting with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, at police officers. The injuries to officers were significant but not life-threatening. The police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking a highway, and about 200 protesters refused to leave the roadway, leading to clashes with police in riot gear. The authorities condemned the violence, with the St. Paul Police Chief saying he was "disgusted" by the acts of some people and vowing not to tolerate it. The incident occurred just days after the murder of five Dallas police officers, and the families of the victims of police killings denounced the attack on the Dallas officers. The event highlights the escalating tensions between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
