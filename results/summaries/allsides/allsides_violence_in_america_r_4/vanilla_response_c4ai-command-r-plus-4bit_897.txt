SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers were injured during protests in Minnesota that turned violent on Saturday night. Protesters threw rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices at officers, leading to clashes between police and protesters. The protests were sparked by recent police killings of black men, including Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. The riots followed the deadly attack on Dallas police officers just days earlier. St. Paul's mayor and police chief condemned the violence and pledged to not tolerate such acts. Minnesota troopers and police worked together to clear the interstate, which reopened in the early morning hours. The previous protests had been peaceful, but Saturday night's protest turned violent with protesters refusing to listen to police. The governor of Minnesota met with Castile's family and friends earlier on Saturday.
END OF SUMMARY.
