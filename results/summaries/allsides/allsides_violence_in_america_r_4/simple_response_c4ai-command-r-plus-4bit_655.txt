SUMMARY: A protest against police killings of black men turned violent in Minnesota on Saturday night, resulting in the arrest of over 100 people and injuries to 21 police officers. Protesters pelted officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, leading to a tense standoff that blocked Interstate 94. This riot occurred just days after a sniper attack in Dallas that targeted white police officers, killing five. The Minnesota protests reflect a nationwide outcry against the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two black men killed by police officers. Despite the peaceful nature of previous demonstrations, Saturday night's protest turned ugly, with protesters throwing objects at officers and refusing to leave the freeway. The police responded with smoke bombs and pepper spray, resulting in a chaotic and dangerous situation. St. Paul's mayor and police chief expressed disgust at the violence and emphasized that such behavior would not be tolerated. This incident highlights the ongoing tension and moral dilemma surrounding police treatment of minorities, with protesters demanding justice and accountability for the killings of black individuals by law enforcement.
