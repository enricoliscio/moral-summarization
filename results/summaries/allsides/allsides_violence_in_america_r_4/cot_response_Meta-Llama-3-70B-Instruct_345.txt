SUMMARY:
A night of protests in Minnesota turned into an "extreme incident" with over 100 arrests and 21 police officers injured. The protests, sparked by the recent police killings of black men, started peacefully but escalated into rioting with demonstrators pelting police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. The injuries to officers were "significant, but none were life-threatening." St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell was "disgusted" by the acts of some people, calling it the "worst" he's seen in 28 years as a police officer. The police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and the freeway was eventually reopened. The protests were a departure from previous peaceful demonstrations, with some protesters turning "violent" and refusing to listen to police. The night's events were an "unfortunate" turn in the wake of the tragic police killings. END OF SUMMARY.
