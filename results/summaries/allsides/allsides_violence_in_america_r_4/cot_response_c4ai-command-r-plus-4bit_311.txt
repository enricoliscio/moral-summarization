SUMMARY: 
An extreme incident of rioting in Minnesota left 21 police officers with significant injuries and resulted in the arrest of over 100 protesters. The unrest came amidst nationwide protests against the recent killings of black men by police officers, specifically the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. St. Paul's mayor, Chris Coleman, and police chief, Todd Axtell, expressed disgust at the violent turn of events, with Axtell noting that it was the worst incident he had witnessed in his 28 years of service. Police in riot gear used smoke bombs and pepper spray to clear the interstate, which had been blocked by demonstrators. The Minnesota governor, Mark Dayton, met with Castile's family and friends earlier in the day, and the conversation was described as cordial. The protests in Minnesota and elsewhere hoped for better police-community relations and an end to the violent deaths of black men at the hands of police. The acts of a few protesters who turned violent, however, threatened to overshadow these peaceful demonstrations and the hopes and prayers of those seeking justice and reconciliation. END OF SUMMARY.
