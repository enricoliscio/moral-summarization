SUMMARY:
A night of protests in Minnesota turned into an "extreme incident" of rioting, leaving 21 police officers injured and over 100 people arrested. The protests, sparked by the recent police killings of black men Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, started peacefully but escalated into violence as demonstrators pelted police with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman and Police Chief Todd Axtell condemned the acts of violence, with Axtell expressing disgust at the attacks on public servants. Despite previous peaceful protests, Saturday night's demonstrators refused to disperse, leading to clashes with police. The situation was eventually brought under control, but not before officers were injured and property was damaged. The incident was a stark contrast to the "cordial" meeting between Gov. Mark Dayton and Castile's family earlier in the day. END OF SUMMARY.
