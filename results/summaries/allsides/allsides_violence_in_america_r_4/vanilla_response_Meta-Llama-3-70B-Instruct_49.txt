SUMMARY:

Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned violent. The protests, which began with a peaceful march, escalated into rioting with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, at police officers. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and over 100 troopers responded to the scene. The injuries to officers were significant but not life-threatening. The St. Paul Mayor and Police Chief condemned the violence, with the Chief saying it was the first time in his 28 years as an officer that he had seen such violence towards police. The protests were among several nationwide following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, and came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered.
