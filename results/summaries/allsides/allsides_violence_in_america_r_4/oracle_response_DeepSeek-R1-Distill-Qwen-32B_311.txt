Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article talks about protests in Minnesota that turned violent, leading to many arrests and injuries. The protests were in response to the police killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The author uses words like "injured," "killings," "rioting," and "murdered" to convey the severity and moral issues involved.

I should focus on including these morally charged words in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, so I'll need to pick the most impactful points. I'll mention the number of arrests and injuries, the reasons for the protests, the violence used by protesters, and the police's response.

I should also highlight the contrast between peaceful protests and the violent escalation. Including quotes from officials like the mayor and police chief can add the moral perspective. It's important to note that the families of the victims condemned the violence against the Dallas officers to show the complexity of the situation.

I'll structure the summary to start with the main event, then the context, the violence, the police response, and the aftermath. Making sure to use the specified moral words to frame the events correctly.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. I'll make sure each sentence adds value and maintains the moral framing without unnecessary details.
