SUMMARY: Protests in Minnesota over the recent police killings of black men Philando Castile and Alton Sterling turned violent on Saturday night, resulting in the arrest of over 100 people and injuries to 21 police officers. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman and Police Chief Todd Axtell described the events as an "extreme incident," with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices at officers. The protests began with a march from the governor's mansion, where Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton had met with Castile's family earlier in the day. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and the freeway reopened around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday. Law enforcement officials expressed disgust at the violence and emphasized that previous protests had been peaceful. The riots in Minnesota came just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper targeting white cops. The families of Castile and Sterling denounced the attack on the Dallas officers.
