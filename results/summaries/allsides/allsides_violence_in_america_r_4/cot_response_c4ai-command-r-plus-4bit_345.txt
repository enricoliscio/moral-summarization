SUMMARY:
Protests in Minnesota over recent police killings of black men turned into rioting, resulting in 102 arrests and injuries to 21 police officers. St. Paul's mayor, Chris Coleman, described the events as an "extreme incident," with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices at officers. The protests, which started with a march from the governor's mansion, were a response to the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, two black men killed by police officers in separate incidents. The riots came just days after the murder of five Dallas police officers by a sniper, which was denounced by Sterling and Castile's families. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators from Interstate 94, and more than 100 troopers worked with St. Paul police to restore order. The protests, which began peacefully, turned violent with protesters throwing debris at officers. St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the violence directed towards public servants and emphasized their hope and prayers for a peaceful night ahead. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton met with Castile's family and friends, and the conversation was described as cordial. The events in Minnesota highlight the ongoing tensions between communities and police, with a focus on the morality of responses to these issues.
