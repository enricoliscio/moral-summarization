SUMMARY:

Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota on Saturday night during protests against recent police killings of black men. The protests, which started with a peaceful march, turned violent when demonstrators pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. Police used smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94, and over 100 troopers responded to the freeway. The injuries to officers were significant but not life-threatening. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman and Police Chief Todd Axtell condemned the violence, with Axtell saying it was the first time in his 28 years as a police officer that he had seen such violence towards public servants. The protests were among several nationwide following the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling.
