SUMMARY: More than 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers were injured in Minnesota on Saturday night as protests over recent police killings of black men turned violent. The protesters pelted police with rocks, rebar and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, leading to a tense standoff with police in riot gear. This riot occurred just days after five Dallas police officers were murdered by a sniper, Micah Johnson, who targeted white cops. The recent deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, both black men, at the hands of police officers have sparked nationwide protests and renewed debates about racial injustice and police brutality. While some protesters in Minnesota maintained peace, others turned to violence, throwing bottles, rocks, and fireworks at officers. The police responded with smoke bombs and pepper spray, eventually clearing the freeway of protesters and making arrests. The governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, met with Castile's family and friends earlier on Saturday, but the discussions did not prevent the violent turn of events that night. These acts of violence against police officers and public servants are disgusting and unacceptable, as St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell stated, and the hope is that such extreme incidents do not recur.
END OF SUMMARY.
