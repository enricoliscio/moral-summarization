Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the protests in Minnesota. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, more than 100 people were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured. The protests were over the police killings of black men, specifically Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. The protests turned into riots, with protesters throwing rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails at police. The police used smoke bombs to control the crowd, and the interstate was blocked but reopened later.

St. Paul's mayor called it an extreme incident. The police chief mentioned it's the first time he's seen such violence. Some protesters were peaceful, but others turned violent. The article also mentions the recent Dallas police attack, which the families of the victims denounced.

I need to make sure the summary includes the main events: arrests, injuries, causes of the protests, the violence involved, police response, and the context of recent police-related incidents. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and present the information clearly.

Let me structure the summary: start with the number of arrests and injuries, mention the protests turning violent, the targets (Castile and Sterling), the police response, and the context of other recent events like Dallas. Also, note that the protests started peacefully but turned violent.

I should avoid including too many details about individual protesters unless they're significant. Keep it focused on the main points.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent, concise manner.
