SUMMARY:

In Minnesota, a protest over recent police killings of black men turned violent, resulting in 102 arrests and 21 injured police officers. The protesters, who were demonstrating against the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, pelted police officers with rocks, rebar, and incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails. The police responded with smoke bombs and riot gear, and eventually cleared the demonstrators from Interstate 94. The St. Paul Mayor and Police Chief condemned the violence, with the Chief calling it the worst he's seen in 28 years of service. The protesters, on the other hand, claimed that the police used excessive force, with some reporting being pepper-sprayed while trying to keep the peace. The incident is a stark contrast to the peaceful protests that preceded it, and highlights the tensions between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
