Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They've listed specific morally charged words that should be included. My task is to create a concise summary, up to 200 words, using those words.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. It's about protests in Minnesota turning violent, leading to arrests and injuries. The protests were sparked by police killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. There was rioting, Molotov cocktails, injuries to police, and a significant number of arrests. The police response included smoke bombs and riot gear. The article also mentions the families denouncing the violence and the context of recent events in Dallas.

Now, I should identify the morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "injured," "killings," "rioting," "arrests," "pelted," "protests," "deaths," "shot," "murdered," "violence," etc., need to be included.

I need to structure the summary to include the main events: the protests, the violence, the arrests, the police response, and the context of the killings. I should make sure to use the listed words to maintain the moral tone.

I'll start by mentioning the 100+ arrests and 21 injured officers. Then, explain that the protests were over police killings, leading to rioting. Include details about Molotov cocktails and rocks being thrown. Mention the police response with smoke bombs and riot gear. Note the unsuccessful attempts to clear the freeway and the violence involved. Finally, reference the recent Dallas murders and the families' denouncements.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting too detailed. Make sure to hit all the key moral words without making the summary too lengthy.

Let me draft this, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary moral framing words and flows logically from one point to the next. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Over 100 people were arrested and 21 police officers injured in Minnesota during violent protests over recent police killings of black men. The protests, which began peacefully, escalated into rioting as demonstrators pelted police with rocks, rebar, and Molotov cocktails. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman described the incident as "extreme," with police using smoke bombs to clear demonstrators blocking Interstate 94. Some protesters turned violent, throwing debris and refusing to disassemble, leading to significant arrests. Police Chief Todd Axtell expressed disgust at the acts of violence, calling it the worst he had seen in his 28 years on the force. The riots followed the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, and came days after five Dallas police officers were murdered. While some protesters remained peaceful, others aimed fireworks at officers, and police responded with pepper spray. The governor met with Castile's family, but the conversation's details were not disclosed. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions between law enforcement and protesters in the wake of these tragic events. END OF SUMMARY.
