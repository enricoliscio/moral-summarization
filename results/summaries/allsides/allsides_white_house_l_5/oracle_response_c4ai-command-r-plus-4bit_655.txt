SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner accused the Obama administration of deliberately altering talking points about the Benghazi attack, which left four Americans dead. Boehner claims that the White House and State Department changed references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, ignoring early warnings and attempting to avoid embarrassment. Republicans assert that the alterations were not made to protect classified information but to mislead the public. An email from a State Department official refers to "Islamic terrorists," contradicting the administration's initial claims. The State Department, however, maintains that they defined the Benghazi incident as a terrorist attack from the beginning. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in investigating the matter and promised appropriate discipline if culpability is found. Boehner demands the release of all relevant emails to the public, insisting that the White House directed the changes to the talking points.
END OF SUMMARY.
