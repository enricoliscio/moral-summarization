SUMMARY:
House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House wanted to change the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The House GOP report concludes that the alterations were made to avoid culpability for missing early warnings. Boehner is demanding the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned‚Äù in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack, promising discipline if necessary. The controversy surrounds the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, which left four Americans dead. END OF SUMMARY.
