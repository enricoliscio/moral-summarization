Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent investigation by the House Republicans. The key points are Boehner's claims that the White House altered talking points to avoid mentioning al-Qaeda links, which downplayed the terrorist angle. The State Department's emails are crucial here, showing that they knew it was a terrorist attack but didn't share that info publicly. The article also mentions Kerry's commitment to investigate fully.

I should focus on the moral issues: the administration's handling of information, whether they misled the public, and the potential consequences. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and highlight Boehner's accusations, the email details, and Kerry's response. I need to make sure the moral implications are clear, like the possible cover-up and the impact on public trust.

Let me structure it: start with Boehner's call for emails, mention the talking points alteration, the email details, and then Kerry's stance. Keep it neutral but highlight the moral framing as presented. Make sure it's within the word limit and ends with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has demanded the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack, accusing the White House of altering talking points to downplay the involvement of extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda. The House GOP report claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to avoid embarrassing the State Department, despite intelligence indicating a terrorist attack. Boehner highlighted an email from a State Department official, sent the day after the attack, which referred to the attackers as "Islamic terrorists." This contradicts Ambassador Susan Rice's public statements, which described the attack as spontaneous and linked to a protest. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and address any culpability. The summary underscores the moral framing of whether the administration misled the public and whether accountability is warranted. END OF SUMMARY.
