Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent investigation by the House. 

The key elements are Boehner's call for emails, the altered talking points, and the State Department's handling of the information. The author used specific morally charged words like "attack," "ignored," "dead," "altered," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main actors: Boehner, Obama, Kerry, Susan Rice, and Beth Jones. The summary should mention the attack, the emails, the talking points alteration, and the State Department's actions. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

I should structure the summary to include Boehner's demands, the content of the emails, the discrepancy in the talking points, and Kerry's commitment. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the author's tone.

Let me draft a summary that captures all these points succinctly. I'll ensure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown. Keeping the language clear and direct while incorporating the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has demanded the release of emails showing how the White House altered "talking points" related to the 2012 Benghazi attack, which left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others dead. Boehner accused the White House of ignoring evidence that senior officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, allegedly to avoid embarrassing the State Department. A recent House GOP report claimed that the White House and State Department personnel deliberately altered the talking points to avoid mentioning extremist groups, despite intelligence indicating the attack was a terrorist act. Obama administration officials acknowledged altering the talking points to preserve classified information, but the House report found no evidence of red flags raised about classified info. Boehner also highlighted an email from a State Department official referring to "Islamic terrorists" as the attackers, which the State Department initially prevented the committees from keeping. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and handling any culpability. END OF SUMMARY.
