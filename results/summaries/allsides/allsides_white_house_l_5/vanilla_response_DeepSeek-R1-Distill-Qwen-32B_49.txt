Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the ongoing investigation. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning House Speaker John Boehner asking President Obama to release emails related to the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. He claims the White House made changes to these talking points to avoid mentioning extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, which could have embarrassed the State Department. The House Republicans released a report last month stating that the White House and State Department altered the talking points to remove references to extremist groups. 

Susan Rice, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, used these talking points in media appearances, stating the attack was a protest, while the intelligence community later clarified it was a terrorist attack. The Obama administration admitted altering the talking points to protect classified info and the FBI investigation, but the House report found no evidence of red flags regarding classified info in the emails reviewed.

Boehner specifically wants an email from a State Department official on September 12, 2012, where she referred to Islamic terrorists. This email was shown at a hearing, indicating the State Department knew the attack was by Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaeda affiliate, days before Rice's TV appearance. 

Secretary of State John Kerry is determined to investigate fully and address any issues. The summary needs to capture these points concisely, under 200 words.

I'll structure the summary by mentioning Boehner's call for emails, the House report's findings, Susan Rice's statements, the administration's response, the email details, and Kerry's commitment. I'll ensure it's clear and within the word limit.
