Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent political fallout. 

First, I should identify the morally charged words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "ignored," "deliberately," "embarrassing," "cover-up," "deception," "misleading," "failure," "culpability," "discipline," "dishonesty," and "transparency" stand out. These words are used to convey blame or moral wrongdoing.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. I'll start by outlining the main points: Boehner's call for emails, the report's claims about altering talking points to avoid embarrassment, Kerry's commitment to investigate, and the email from Beth Jones. I should include the morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective. 

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words. I'll structure it by mentioning the key players, their actions, and the moral implications. I'll make sure to highlight the accusations of covering up the truth and the potential for discipline if wrongdoing is found. 

I should also mention the email from Beth Jones, emphasizing how the State Department handled the information. Finally, I'll wrap up with Secretary Kerry's determination to resolve the issue. 

Putting it all together, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, includes all the important points, and retains the moral framing from the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  
House Speaker John Boehner has demanded the release of emails related to the Benghazi attack, accusing the Obama administration of making "stylistic changes" to talking points to avoid embarrassment. A House Republican report claims that senior White House officials altered intelligence community talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, allegedly to prevent embarrassment over missed warnings. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to investigate fully and address the matter, while the administration has acknowledged altering talking points to protect classified information. Boehner highlighted an email from a State Department official, Beth Jones, who described the attack as carried out by "Islamic terrorists" days before Ambassador Susan Rice downplayed it as a spontaneous protest. The State Department maintains it defined the attack as terrorist from the start, but the report suggests a potential cover-up. Kerry emphasized accountability and discipline if wrongdoing is found, while Boehner accused the administration of failing to act with transparency.
