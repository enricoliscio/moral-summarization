Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed example, but I should approach it as if I'm a novice. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

First, the article is about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent investigation. It mentions Speaker Boehner calling on Obama to release emails, which suggests there's a dispute over transparency. The key moral words I need to identify are things like "cover-up," "dishonesty," "transparency," etc.

I should go through each paragraph and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. For example, "cover-up" implies hiding something wrong, "dishonesty" is about lying, "transparency" is about openness. These words are crucial because they frame the issue morally.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. The summary should include these moral terms to maintain the author's framing. I'll need to mention Boehner's demands, the emails, the talking points alteration, and the implications of the State Department's actions. I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.

Wait, the example provided by the user already did this, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. I should ensure that in my summary, I include the moral elements like "cover-up," "dishonesty," and "transparency." I'll make sure the summary reflects the conflict between Boehner and the White House, the emails, and the implications for the investigation.

I think I've got the gist. I'll structure the summary to highlight the key moral issues, ensuring that the framing is preserved as per the original article.

**SUMMARY:**

House Speaker John Boehner has demanded that President Obama release emails related to the Benghazi attack, alleging that the White House made changes to talking points to avoid embarrassment. The emails, seen by House committees, reportedly refer to "Islamic terrorists" as responsible for the attack. Boehner accused the administration of a cover-up, claiming that senior officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The House GOP report criticized the administration for altering the talking points, which Rice used on TV, stating the attack was spontaneous, while intelligence later confirmed it as a terrorist act. The State Department maintains it defined the attack as terrorist since September 12. Secretary Kerry vowed a thorough investigation, emphasizing transparency and accountability. Boehner's call for disclosure highlights concerns about honesty and the administration's handling of the incident. END OF SUMMARY.
