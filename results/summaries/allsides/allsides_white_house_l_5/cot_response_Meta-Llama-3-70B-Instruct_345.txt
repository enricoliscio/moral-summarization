STEP 1:
* embarrassing
* culpability
* discipline

SUMMARY:
House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House wanted to change the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, which was done to avoid culpability. The report concludes that the White House and State Department personnel deliberately altered the talking points to downplay the terrorist attack. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to "leave no stone unturned‚Äù in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack, promising discipline if necessary. Boehner is pushing for the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. The email, sent the day after the attack, contradicts the administration's initial claims that the attack was a spontaneous protest. END OF SUMMARY.
