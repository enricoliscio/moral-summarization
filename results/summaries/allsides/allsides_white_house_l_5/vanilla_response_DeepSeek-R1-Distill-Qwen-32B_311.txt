Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Benghazi attack and the political fallout around it. So, key players are John Boehner, President Obama, John Kerry, Susan Rice, and Beth Jones.

Boehner is demanding emails that he claims show the White House tried to change talking points related to the attack. The House report says the White House and State Department altered the talking points to remove references to al-Qaeda-linked groups, to avoid embarrassment. Rice initially said the attack was a protest, but later it was found to be a terrorist act.

Obama's team admits they changed the talking points to protect classified info and not interfere with the FBI, but the House found no evidence of that in emails. Boehner specifically wants an email from Beth Jones, who told the Libyan ambassador that the attackers were linked to Islamic terrorists. This email was sent before Rice's TV appearances.

Kerry is handling the investigation now, saying they'll leave no stone unturned and address any accountability.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Boehner's demand for emails, the House report's findings, the discrepancy in the talking points, Rice's initial statement vs the truth, Obama's team's explanation, the Beth Jones email, and Kerry's response.

I should structure it clearly, starting with Boehner's call, then the report's conclusions, the email details, and end with Kerry's commitment. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's role in altering talking points related to the 2012 Benghazi attack. The House Republican report claims that White House and State Department officials removed references to al-Qaeda-linked groups to avoid embarrassment, while the Obama administration maintains the changes were to protect classified information. Boehner specifically wants an email from a State Department official stating that Islamic terrorists were behind the attack, which contradicts Susan Rice's initial claim that the attack was a spontaneous protest. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and address any accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
