SUMMARY:
House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's attempts to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, which led to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice's misleading statements on Sunday morning news shows. The House GOP report suggests that the administration deliberately altered the talking points to avoid culpability for missing early warnings. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned‚Äù in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack, promising discipline if any wrongdoing is found. The controversy surrounds the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, which left four Americans dead. END OF SUMMARY.
