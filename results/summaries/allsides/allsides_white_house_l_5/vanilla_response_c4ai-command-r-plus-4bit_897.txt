SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner calls on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack, claiming they show the White House's involvement in altering "talking points." Boehner alleges that the White House and State Department deliberately removed references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda to avoid embarrassment. He also highlights an email from a State Department official referring to "Islamic terrorists." Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy supports Boehner's claims by reading an excerpt from the email sent the day after the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry vows to thoroughly investigate the matter and address any culpability. The State Department maintains that they have defined the attack as a terrorist act since September 12, contrary to Susan Rice's description of it as a spontaneous attack arising from a demonstration.

END OF SUMMARY.
