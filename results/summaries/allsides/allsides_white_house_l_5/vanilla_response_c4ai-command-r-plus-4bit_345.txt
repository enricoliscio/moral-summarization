SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner calls on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack and the subsequent changes made to the "talking points" used by US Ambassador Susan Rice. Boehner alleges that the White House and State Department deliberately altered the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda and played down the role of terrorists. The House GOP report claims that the changes were made to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner also reveals the existence of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as the perpetrators of the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry vows to leave no stone unturned in investigating the matter and promises appropriate action if any culpability is found. The State Department maintains that they have defined the Benghazi violence as a terrorist attack since September 12, contrary to Rice's statements.
END OF SUMMARY.
