SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack, claiming the White House altered talking points to avoid embarrassment. The House GOP report accused the administration of removing references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, which were later identified as the attackers. Boehner highlighted an email from a State Department official stating the attack was carried out by Islamic terrorists, which the State Department tried to prevent from being retained. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in the investigation, emphasizing the need to handle any culpability appropriately. The report also revealed that the administration's talking points downplayed the violence, claiming it was a spontaneous protest, despite intelligence indicating it was a terrorist attack. The State Department has maintained that it defined the violence as a terrorist attack since September 12, but was surprised by Rice's initial characterization. END OF SUMMARY.
