SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner called on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack and the administration's response, alleging that they show the White House wanted to change the "talking points" to downplay the role of extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda. Boehner claimed that the White House made substantive changes to the talking points, contrary to their assertion that they only made stylistic changes. He also referenced an email from a State Department official sent the day after the attack, which referred to "Islamic terrorists." The House GOP report on the attack suggested that the changes were made to avoid embarrassing the State Department for missing early warnings. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in the investigation and promised appropriate action if any culpability is found. The State Department maintained that they have defined the attack as a terrorist act since September 12, contrary to Susan Rice's statements on news shows.
END OF SUMMARY.
