SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House wanted to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points" to ignore the fact that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points. The emails, seen privately by House committees, claim that the White House and State Department personnel deliberately altered the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, leaving out crucial information and missing early warnings. This alteration of facts led to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice claiming the attack originated from a protest, when in fact it was a terrorist attack. Boehner is also demanding the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official, which refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned‚Äù in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack.
