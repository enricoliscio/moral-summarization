SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner accused the Obama administration of deliberately altering talking points about the Benghazi attack that left four Americans dead. Boehner claims that the White House and State Department changed references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, ignoring early warnings and attempting to avoid embarrassment. The altered talking points were used by Susan Rice, who claimed the attack originated from a protest, when in fact it was a terrorist attack. Boehner demands the release of emails that show how the White House directed these changes. An email from a State Department official also refers to "Islamic terrorists," contradicting the official narrative. The State Department, however, maintains that they've defined the violence as a terrorist attack from the start. Secretary Kerry vows to leave no stone unturned in the investigation, promising appropriate discipline if culpability is found.
END OF SUMMARY.
