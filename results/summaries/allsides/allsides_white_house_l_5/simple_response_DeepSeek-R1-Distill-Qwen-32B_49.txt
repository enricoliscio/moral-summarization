Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

Alright, the article is about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent investigation. House Speaker Boehner is asking President Obama to release emails that supposedly show the White House wanted to change the talking points about the attack. Secretary Kerry is involved too, saying they'll leave no stone unturned. The key points are about the talking points being altered to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, which was done to avoid embarrassing the State Department. The report from House Republicans claims that the White House made these changes, not just stylistic ones. They also mention an email from a State Department official referring to Islamic terrorists, which the State Department tried to prevent the committees from keeping.

So, the moral framing here seems to be about transparency and accountability. The Republicans are accusing the Obama administration of hiding information and altering facts to protect their image. The White House's side is that they were preserving classified info, but the report says there's no evidence of that. The email from Beth Jones is a crucial point because it shows the State Department knew it was a terrorist attack before Rice's public statements.

I need to make sure the summary captures this conflict between the White House and the House Republicans, highlighting the accusations of hiding information and the implications for transparency. Also, the email is a key piece of evidence that supports the Republican claims.

Let me structure this: start with Boehner's call for emails, mention the report's findings about altering talking points to avoid embarrassment. Then talk about the email from Beth Jones and how the State Department tried to withhold it. Conclude with Secretary Kerry's commitment to investigate fully.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all the main points. Make sure to mention the moral implications, like hiding information and the cover-up allegations.

Wait, the user mentioned I should return the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it that way. Also, ensure the summary is in my own words but retains the original moral framing.

Let me draft it:

SUMMARY: House Speaker Boehner has demanded the release of emails showing the White House's role in altering talking points related to the Benghazi attack, accusing the administration of hiding information to avoid embarrassment. A Republican report claims the White House removed references to al-Qaeda-linked groups from the talking points. Boehner highlighted an email from a State Department official identifying the attackers as Islamic terrorists, which the department tried to prevent from being retained. The administration maintains they altered the talking points to protect classified info, but the report found no evidence of such concerns. Secretary Kerry vows to thoroughly investigate and address any accountability issues. The situation raises questions about transparency and whether the administration misled the public. END OF SUMMARY.

That should cover all the key points and the moral framing around transparency and accountability.
