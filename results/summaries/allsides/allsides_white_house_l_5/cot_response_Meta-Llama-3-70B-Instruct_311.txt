SUMMARY:
House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House wanted to change the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The altered talking points were used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, who incorrectly stated that the attack originated from a protest outside of the compound. Boehner is demanding the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned‚Äù in investigating the matter and answering questions. Kerry promises that if there is any culpability, it will be handled with discipline. The White House has maintained that they've been defining the violence as a terrorist attack since September 12.
END OF SUMMARY.
