Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the related political developments. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article starts with House Speaker John Boehner asking President Obama to release emails related to the talking points used after the Benghazi attack. He claims the White House made changes to these talking points to avoid mentioning extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, which would have embarrassed the State Department for not having early warnings.

Then, Secretary of State John Kerry is mentioned, saying they'll leave no stone unturned in investigating. Boehner is upset because the White House only admits to stylistic changes, but the emails show more intent. The House report from last month accuses the administration of altering the talking points to remove references to extremist groups, which was done to prevent embarrassment.

The article also talks about an email from Beth Jones, a State Department official, who told the Libyan ambassador that the attackers were affiliated with Islamic terrorists. Boehner wants this email made public. The State Department, however, maintains they've always considered it a terrorist attack since September 12, but Susan Rice described it differently on TV.

Kerry is determined to get answers and handle any culpability. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: Boehner's request, the email details, the talking points alteration, Kerry's stance, and the email's contents.

I should structure the summary to first mention Boehner's call for emails, then the contents of the emails, the talking points issue, and Kerry's response. Make sure to keep it within the word limit and end with the specified tokens.
