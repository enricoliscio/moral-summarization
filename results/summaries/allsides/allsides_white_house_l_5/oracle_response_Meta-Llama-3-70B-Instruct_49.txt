SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's attempt to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points, ignoring the fact that the intelligence community's original version mentioned extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The altered talking points, used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, attributed the attack to a protest outside the compound, rather than a terrorist attack. Boehner is demanding the release of an email from a top State Department official, which refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack, leaving four Americans dead. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack. The administration's handling of the situation has been marred by claims of ignoring and altering the truth, leading to violence and death.

END OF SUMMARY.
