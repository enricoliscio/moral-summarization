SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner called on President Obama to release emails that would show how the White House wanted to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points." Boehner argued that the White House made deliberate changes to the talking points, removing references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda to avoid embarrassment for the State Department. He also requested the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official that referred to "Islamic terrorists" as the perpetrators of the attack. The investigation by House committees found no evidence that the administration raised concerns about securing classified information. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave "no stone unturned" in the inquiry and promised appropriate discipline for any culpability. The State Department maintained that they had defined the violence as a terrorist attack since September 12, contrary to Susan Rice's description of it as a spontaneous attack from a demonstration. Obama administration officials acknowledged alterations to the talking points to preserve classified information but denied any wrongdoing.
