SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is demanding that President Obama release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in altering "talking points" about the Benghazi attack to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The altered talking points were used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, who incorrectly stated that the attack originated from a protest outside the compound. The House GOP report suggests that the administration deliberately altered the talking points to avoid accountability for missing early warnings. Boehner is also calling for the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and answering questions.
