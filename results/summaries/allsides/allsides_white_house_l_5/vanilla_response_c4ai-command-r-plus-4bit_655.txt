SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner called on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack and subsequent changes to talking points used by US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice. Boehner alleged that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda and that the State Department knew the attack was carried out by Islamic terrorists. Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy supported Boehner's claims by reading an excerpt from an email sent by a State Department official the day after the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in investigating the matter and answer any remaining questions. Obama administration officials previously acknowledged alterations to the talking points to preserve classified information and avoid impacting the FBI investigation. Boehner requested the disclosure of the emails to the public, stating that the White House continues to claim that only stylistic changes were made.
END OF SUMMARY.
