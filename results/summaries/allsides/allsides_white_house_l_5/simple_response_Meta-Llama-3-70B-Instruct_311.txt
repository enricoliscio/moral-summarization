SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's attempt to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassment. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, despite the administration's claims that the changes were only stylistic. The emails, which have been seen by House committees, reportedly show that the State Department knew the attack was carried out by Islamic terrorists, but this information was not shared with the public. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter, but Boehner is skeptical, calling for the release of the emails to the public. The moral framing of this story is one of accountability and transparency, with Boehner accusing the White House of trying to cover up the truth and Kerry promising to get to the bottom of the matter.

END OF SUMMARY.
