Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent investigation. The key players are John Boehner, President Obama, John Kerry, Susan Rice, and Beth Jones. The main issue is the alteration of talking points regarding the attack's cause.

First, I need to identify all the morally framed words. I'll go through the text and pick out words that carry moral implications. Words like "called," "ignored," "deliberately," "cover up," "avoid," "embarrassing," "spontaneous," "deceiving," "consequences," "culpability," "handled," "discipline," "handled," "deceiving," "cover up," "spontaneous," "embarrassing," "avoid," "ignored," "deliberately," "handled," "culpability," "handled," "discipline," "handled," "deceiving," "cover up," "spontaneous," "embarrassing," "avoid," "ignored," "deliberately," "handled," "culpability," "handled," "discipline," "handled," "deceiving," "cover up," "spontaneous," "embarrassing," "avoid," "ignored," "deliberately," "handled," "culpability," "handled," "discipline," "handled," "deceiving," "cover up," "spontaneous," "embarrassing," "avoid," "ignored," "deliberately."

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. I should list each morally charged word once. Let me go through the article again:

- Boehner "called" on Obama to release emails. "Called" implies a demand, which is a moral stance.
- "Ignored" the fact that seniors directed changes. Ignoring is a moral failure.
- "Deliberately" altered talking points. Deliberate implies intent, which is a moral issue.
- "Cover up" early warnings. Covering up is morally wrong.
- "Avoid" embarrassing the State Department. Avoiding embarrassment is a motive, which is moral.
- "Spontaneous" attack vs. terrorist attack. Spontaneous was used to deceive.
- "Deceiving" the public. Deception is a moral failing.
- "Consequences" of the attack. Consequences imply responsibility.
- "Culpability" in the matter. Culpability is about blame.
- "Handled" appropriately. Handling implies responsibility.
- "Discipline" if needed. Discipline is a form of accountability.

So the morally framed words are: called, ignored, deliberately, cover up, avoid, spontaneous, deceiving, consequences, culpability, handled, discipline, handled, deceiving, cover up, spontaneous, embarrassing, avoid, ignored, deliberately, handled, culpability, handled, discipline, handled, deceiving, cover up, spontaneous, embarrassing, avoid, ignored, deliberately.

Wait, I think I'm repeating some. Let me list each once:

called, ignored, deliberately, cover up, avoid, spontaneous, deceiving, consequences, culpability, handled, discipline.

Now, for the summary. I need to include these words while keeping it concise. The summary should reflect the moral framing, so I'll focus on the accusations and the implications.

Boehner accuses the White House of altering talking points to avoid embarrassment, which is a cover-up. The emails show that the State Department knew it was a terrorist attack but Rice called it spontaneous. The administration's actions were deceptive, leading to questions about culpability and whether discipline will be applied.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight the accusations, the cover-up, the deception, and the consequences of their actions.

**SUMMARY:**
House Speaker John Boehner accused the Obama administration of altering talking points to avoid embarrassment after the 2012 Benghazi attack, claiming the White House deliberately removed references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. Boehner called for the release of emails showing a senior State Department official described the attack as carried out by Islamic terrorists, which contradicted Ambassador Susan Rice's initial claim of a spontaneous protest. The administration acknowledged altering the talking points to protect classified information, but Boehner argued there was no evidence of such concerns in the emails. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to address the matter and determine if any culpability exists, emphasizing the need for accountability. The accusations highlight concerns about deception and the potential consequences of the administration's handling of the situation.
