SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that purportedly show how the White House wanted to alter Benghazi attack "talking points." Boehner alleges that the White House directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, which would have been embarrassing for the State Department. The House GOP report indicates that there was no evidence of concern for securing classified information in the email traffic about the talking points. Boehner also highlighted an email from a State Department official that referred to "Islamic terrorists" as the perpetrators of the attack. The State Department has maintained that they defined the violence as a terrorist attack from the start, contrary to Susan Rice's description of it as a spontaneous attack arising from a demonstration. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in the Benghazi investigation and promised appropriate discipline for any culpability that is found. END OF SUMMARY
