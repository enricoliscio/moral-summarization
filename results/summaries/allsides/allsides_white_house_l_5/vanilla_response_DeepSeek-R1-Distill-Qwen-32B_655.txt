Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first.

The article is about the Benghazi attack and the ongoing investigation. House Speaker Boehner is asking President Obama to release emails related to the talking points used after the attack. The House report claims that the White House and State Department changed these talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, to avoid embarrassment.

Boehner mentioned an email from a State Department official that referred to Islamic terrorists. This email was shown in a hearing, and it's important because it contradicts Susan Rice's initial statements that the attack was spontaneous.

Secretary Kerry is involved now, saying they'll leave no stone unturned and handle any culpability appropriately.

I should include the key points: Boehner's request for emails, the House report's findings, the email details, and Kerry's response. Keep it under 200 words and in a clear, concise manner.

A House Republican report alleges the administration altered intelligence community talking points to remove references to al-Qaeda-linked groups to avoid embarrassment. Boehner highlighted an email from a State Department official on September 12, 2012, stating the attack was carried out by Islamic terrorists, which contradicted Ambassador Susan Rice's initial characterization as a spontaneous protest.
