Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the specific morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent political fallout. House Speaker Boehner is asking President Obama to release emails related to the talking points used after the attack. The House GOP report claims that the White House altered the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, to avoid embarrassment. Secretary Kerry is involved in the investigation and wants to leave no stone unturned.

The key morally framed words are: attack, leave, claim, ignoring, dead, altered, missing, violence, alter, attacks, handled. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main points: the attack on the diplomatic compound, the deaths, the alteration of talking points, the emails, the claims by Boehner, and Kerry's response. I need to weave in the moral words naturally.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the attack and the resulting deaths. Then, discuss the alteration of talking points and the claims made by Boehner about the White House ignoring the changes. Include the email from Beth Jones and how the State Department handled the information. Finally, mention Kerry's determination to handle the issue.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including all the necessary moral terms. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered and the words are preserved.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House altered "talking points" related to the 2012 Benghazi attack, which left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead. Boehner claims the White House ignored evidence that senior officials directed changes to the talking points, removing references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda to avoid embarrassment. A House GOP report released last month accused the administration of altering the talking points to preserve classified information, but Boehner insists there is no evidence of red flags being raised. He also highlighted an email from a State Department official stating that the attack was conducted by Islamic terrorists, which the State Department reportedly did not allow committees to keep copies of. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and ensuring any culpability is appropriately handled. END OF SUMMARY.
