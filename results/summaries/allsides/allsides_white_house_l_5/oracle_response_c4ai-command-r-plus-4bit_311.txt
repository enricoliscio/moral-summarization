SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner accused the Obama administration of deliberately altering talking points regarding the Benghazi attack that left four Americans dead. Boehner claimed that the White House and State Department changed references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, ignoring early warnings and attempting to avoid embarrassment. He demanded the release of emails that allegedly show how the White House wanted to change the talking points, asserting that they directed the changes. The House GOP report indicated that there was no evidence of concerns about securing classified information. Boehner also highlighted an email from a State Department official referring to "Islamic terrorists," which the State Department did not allow committees to retain. Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy supported Boehner's claims by reading an excerpt from the email. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure appropriate discipline if any culpability is found.
END OF SUMMARY.
