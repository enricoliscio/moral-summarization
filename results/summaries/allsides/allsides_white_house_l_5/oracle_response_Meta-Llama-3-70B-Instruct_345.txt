SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in altering "talking points" about the Benghazi attack, which left four Americans dead. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to avoid embarrassing the State Department for missing early warnings. The altered talking points, used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, ignored the fact that extremist groups linked to al Qaeda were involved in the attack. Boehner is demanding the release of an email from a top State Department official, which refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack. Kerry promises to handle any culpability appropriately, but Boehner remains skeptical, accusing the White House of ignoring the truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
