SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner accused the White House of deliberately altering talking points about the Benghazi attack, which left four Americans dead. Boehner claimed that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points, ignoring the fact that they wanted to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda. The White House claimed they only made stylistic changes to protect classified information, but Boehner argued that emails show otherwise. He also revealed that a State Department official, Beth Jones, emailed her superiors the day after the attack, referring to "Islamic terrorists." However, the State Department maintained that they have defined the violence as a terrorist attack since September 12. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in investigating the matter and promised appropriate discipline for any culpability. Boehner called for the public release of the emails to bring the issue to an end.
END OF SUMMARY.
