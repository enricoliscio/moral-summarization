Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include those where appropriate. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent investigation. Boehner is pushing Obama to release emails that supposedly show the White House altering talking points to avoid mentioning extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The report from the House GOP says that the White House made these changes to avoid embarrassment, not to protect classified info. 

Boehner mentions an email where a State Department official called the attackers Islamic terrorists, which contradicts Rice's earlier statements. The State Department claims they've been calling it a terrorist attack since September 12. Kerry is involved now, saying he wants to handle any culpability appropriately.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: attack, leave, claim, ignoring, dead, altered, missing, violence, alter, attacks, handled. I should structure the summary to highlight the key points using these words.

I'll start by mentioning the Benghazi attack and the deaths. Then, Boehner's call for emails, the claim about altering talking points to avoid embarrassment. Include the email reference to Islamic terrorists and the discrepancy with Rice's statements. Mention Kerry's determination to handle the issue. Make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of those words as possible without forcing them in.

I think the summary I provided earlier does that, but I'll double-check. It mentions the attack, dead, altered, claim, ignoring, leave, violence, attacks, handled. That's most of them. I need to ensure it's clear and flows well while preserving the moral elements like the criticism of altering information to avoid embarrassment and the potential mishandling of the situation.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack, claiming the White House altered talking points to avoid mentioning extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The House GOP report accuses the administration of ignoring the need to preserve classified information, instead altering the talking points to avoid embarrassment. Boehner highlighted an email from a State Department official referring to "Islamic terrorists" as the attackers, which contradicts former Ambassador Susan Rice's initial claim that the violence was spontaneous. The State Department has maintained that they defined the attack as a terrorist act since September 12. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in addressing the matter and handling any culpability appropriately. END OF SUMMARY.
