Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent political fallout. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave it. Hmm, the article is about how House Speaker Boehner is pushing for the release of emails related to the talking points used after the attack. The key points are that the White House made changes to the talking points to avoid mentioning extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, which might have been to prevent embarrassing the State Department. The House Republicans released a report saying that the administration altered the talking points, and they want the emails made public.

I should make sure to include that Boehner is accusing the White House of making more than just stylistic changes. Also, the email from Beth Jones, the State Department official, is important because she referred to Islamic terrorists, which contradicts Susan Rice's initial statements. Secretary Kerry is involved too, saying they'll leave no stone unturned and handle any culpability appropriately.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main accusations and the key players. The moral framing here seems to be about transparency and accountability, so I should highlight how the Republicans are pushing for the emails to be released to hold the administration accountable. The State Department's response and Kerry's stance should also be included to show the ongoing investigation.

Let me structure this: start with Boehner's call for emails, mention the report's findings, the email from Jones, and Kerry's commitment. Make sure each point is concise and flows logically. I need to avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, maintaining the moral perspective of accountability and transparency.
