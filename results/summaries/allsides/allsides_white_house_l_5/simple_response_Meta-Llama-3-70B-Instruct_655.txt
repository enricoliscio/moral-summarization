SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in altering "talking points" about the Benghazi attack to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The altered talking points were used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, who incorrectly stated that the attack originated from a protest outside the compound. Boehner is also seeking the release of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and answering questions. The controversy highlights the Obama administration's alleged attempts to conceal the truth about the Benghazi attack and its links to terrorism.
