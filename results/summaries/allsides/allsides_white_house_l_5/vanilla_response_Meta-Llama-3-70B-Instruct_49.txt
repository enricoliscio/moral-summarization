SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in changing the Benghazi attack "talking points." Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, in order to avoid embarrassing the State Department. The emails in question were reviewed privately by House committees, but Boehner wants them made public. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack. Kerry stated that he is determined to get answers and put the issue "to bed." The controversy surrounds the Obama administration's initial characterization of the attack as a spontaneous protest, rather than a terrorist attack.

END OF SUMMARY.
