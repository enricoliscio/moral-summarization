SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House wanted to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points". The emails in question suggest that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points, downplaying the role of extremist groups linked to al Qaeda and instead blaming the attack on a protest outside the compound. This alteration has been interpreted as a deliberate attempt to avoid embarrassment for the State Department. The White House has maintained that changes to the talking points were made to protect classified information and the integrity of the FBI investigation. However, Boehner and other House Republican leaders have challenged this assertion, arguing that there was no evidence of concerns about classified information in email discussions about the talking points. They have also pointed to an email from a State Department official referring to "Islamic terrorists", which was not allowed to be copied by House committees. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and determine if any disciplinary action or culpability is warranted. END OF SUMMARY.
