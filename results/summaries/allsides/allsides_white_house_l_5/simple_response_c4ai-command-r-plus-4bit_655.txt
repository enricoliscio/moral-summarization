SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner accused the Obama administration of altering talking points about the Benghazi attack to protect the State Department, calling for the release of emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in changing the narrative. Boehner argued that the White House directed changes to the talking points used by Ambassador Susan Rice, downplaying the role of extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda. He also referenced an email from a State Department official that referred to "Islamic terrorists," which the State Department did not allow House committees to retain. Boehner's claims were supported by the House GOP report, which indicated that alterations were made to the talking points despite a lack of concern over classified information. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter, promising to address any culpability and put the issue to rest. This exchange highlights the ethical and moral implications of transparency and accountability in government, with Boehner demanding full disclosure and Kerry promising to handle any wrongdoing appropriately.
END OF SUMMARY.
