SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner accused the White House of deliberately altering talking points about the Benghazi attack, which left four Americans dead. Boehner claimed that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points, ignoring the fact that they wanted to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda. The White House claimed they only made stylistic changes to protect classified information, but Boehner argued that email evidence suggests otherwise. He also called for the release of an email from a State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as the perpetrators of the attack. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in investigating the matter and ensuring appropriate discipline for any culpability. Boehner's accusations and Kerry's commitment to transparency highlight the ongoing efforts to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
