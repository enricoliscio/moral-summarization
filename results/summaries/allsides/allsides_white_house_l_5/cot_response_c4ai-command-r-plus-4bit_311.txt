SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House wanted to alter Benghazi attack "talking points". The emails in question are said to reveal that senior White House officials directed changes to be made to the talking points, removing references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. This alteration has been interpreted as a deliberate attempt to avoid embarrassment for the State Department. Boehner also requested the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as the perpetrators of the attack. He suggested that this email contradicts the official narrative that the attack arose from a protest. The State Department, however, maintains that they have defined the violence as a terrorist attack from the outset. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter, stating that any culpability will be handled with appropriate discipline. He also emphasized that recent evidence will be considered in the ongoing investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
