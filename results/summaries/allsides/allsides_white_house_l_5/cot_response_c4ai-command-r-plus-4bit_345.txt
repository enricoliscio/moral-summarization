SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House wanted to alter talking points about the Benghazi attack. Boehner claims that the White House directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, which could have been *embarrassing* for the State Department. The House GOP report suggests that these changes were *deliberate* and not made to protect classified information, as the Obama administration has claimed. Boehner also highlighted an email from a State Department official that referred to "Islamic terrorists" as the perpetrators of the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to get to the bottom of the matter and determine if any *culpability* exists, promising appropriate *discipline*. He also stated that any *recent evidence* will be considered in the ongoing investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
