SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show how the White House altered talking points on the Benghazi attack to downplay the role of extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda. Boehner accused the White House of directing changes to the talking points to avoid embarrassing the State Department for missing early warnings. He also referenced an email from a State Department official that referred to "Islamic terrorists" as perpetrators of the attack, which the State Department did not allow House committees to retain. Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy supported Boehner's claims by reading an excerpt from the email at a House hearing. The State Department has maintained that they have defined the Benghazi attack as a terrorist act since September 12. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in investigating the matter and promised appropriate discipline if any culpability is found. Boehner's call for transparency and accountability highlights the moral imperative of truth and justice, ensuring that those responsible for the Benghazi attack are identified and that the public receives accurate and transparent information from their government.
