SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in changing the Benghazi attack "talking points". Boehner claims that the emails will reveal that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, in order to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack. Boehner also wants the White House to disclose an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. The email, sent the day after the attack, contradicts the administration's initial claim that the attack was a spontaneous response to a protest. Kerry has promised to get to the bottom of the issue and take appropriate disciplinary action if necessary.

END OF SUMMARY.
