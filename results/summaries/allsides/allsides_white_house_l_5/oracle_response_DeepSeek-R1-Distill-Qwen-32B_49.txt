Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the article's content. It's about the Benghazi attack and the political fallout between the House Republicans and the Obama administration.

First, I notice that the article mentions several morally charged words like "attack," "dead," "altered," "missing," etc. My task is to include as many of these as possible in the summary without losing the moral tone the author intended.

I should identify the key points: Boehner is accusing the White House of altering talking points to avoid embarrassment. The report by House Republicans says the White House removed references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. There's an email from a State Department official referring to Islamic terrorists, which the State Department tried to keep secret. Secretary Kerry is committed to a thorough investigation.

I need to structure the summary to include these elements, making sure to use the morally framed words. I'll start by stating Boehner's call for emails, then mention the report's findings, the email incident, and Kerry's response. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within 200 words.

Let me check if I'm including all the necessary moral words: attack, claim, ignoring, dead, altered, missing, violence, alter, attacks, handled. I should make sure each is appropriately placed without forcing them in.

I also need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting from Boehner's call, the report's claims, the email incident, and ending with Kerry's commitment. This should encapsulate the main moral issues highlighted in the article.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's under 200 words and that all the key points and moral words are included. I think that's a solid approach to meet the user's requirements.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails showing how the White House allegedly altered "talking points" related to the 2012 Benghazi attack, which left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead. Boehner accused the White House of ignoring evidence that senior officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, allegedly to avoid embarrassing the State Department for missing early warnings. A House GOP report claimed the administration altered the talking points to preserve classified information, but Boehner said no evidence of such concerns was found in emails reviewed by House committees. He also highlighted an email from a State Department official referring to the attack as being carried out by "Islamic terrorists," which the State Department reportedly did not allow committees to keep. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter, emphasizing the need to address any culpability and handle the issue appropriately. END OF SUMMARY.
