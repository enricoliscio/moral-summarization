SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner called on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack and subsequent changes to talking points used by US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice. Boehner alleges that the White House directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, in order to avoid embarrassing the State Department. The House GOP report claims that email traffic reviewed by House committees found no evidence of concerns over classified information. Boehner also referenced an email from a State Department official sent the day after the attack, which referred to "Islamic terrorists." Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy revealed part of the email at a House hearing, stating that the official told the Libyan ambassador that the attack was carried out by Ansar al-Sharia, a group affiliated with Islamic terrorists. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in the investigation and promised appropriate action if any culpability is found.
END OF SUMMARY.
