Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about the Benghazi attack and the subsequent investigation. Boehner is calling for the release of emails that show the White House's involvement in changing talking points. The House report claims the White House altered the talking points to avoid embarrassment, which suggests a cover-up. The emails mention Islamic terrorists, which contradicts Rice's initial statements.

I should highlight the key points: Boehner's demand for emails, the House report's claims, the discrepancy in the talking points, and Kerry's commitment to investigate. Also, the moral issue here is the potential cover-up and misrepresentation of the attack's nature.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral implications. I'll structure it to show the conflict between Boehner's allegations and the administration's stance, emphasizing the transparency issue.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has demanded the release of emails showing how the White House allegedly altered talking points related to the 2012 Benghazi attack, claiming the changes were not merely stylistic but aimed at avoiding embarrassment. A House Republican report accused the White House and State Department of removing references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda to downplay the attack's terrorist nature. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter. Boehner highlighted an email from a State Department official, sent the day after the attack, which referred to the attackers as "Islamic terrorists," contradicting Ambassador Susan Rice's initial statements that the attack was spontaneous. The State Department has maintained it defined the attack as a terrorist act from September 12, but officials were surprised by Rice's characterization. Boehner's request underscores concerns about transparency and accountability in the handling of the Benghazi incident. END OF SUMMARY.
