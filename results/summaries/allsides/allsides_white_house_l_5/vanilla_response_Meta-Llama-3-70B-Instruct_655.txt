SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in changing the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The emails, seen privately by House committees, contradict the White House's claim that only stylistic changes were made. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack. Boehner also called for the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official, which refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Kerry has promised to get answers to questions and put the issue "to bed."

END OF SUMMARY.
