Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the ongoing Benghazi investigation involving the U.S. government. It mentions House Speaker John Boehner calling on President Obama to release emails that supposedly show the White House altering talking points related to the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry is also involved, stating that he'll leave no stone unturned in the investigation.

Boehner is saying the White House made more than just stylistic changes to the talking points used by Susan Rice, the Ambassador. The House Republicans' report claims that the White House and State Department changed the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda, to avoid embarrassment. Rice initially described the attack as spontaneous, but later intelligence indicated it was a terrorist act.

The article also talks about an email from Beth Jones, a State Department official, who informed the Libyan ambassador that the attackers were linked to Islamic terrorists. Boehner wants this email made public. The State Department has maintained that they defined the attack as terrorist from September 12, but were surprised by Rice's description on TV.

Kerry is determined to get answers and address any culpability. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, within 200 words. I should make sure to include the key players, their actions, and the main issues like the talking points alteration and the email details.

Let me structure this: start with Boehner's call, mention the report's findings, the email details, and Kerry's stance. Keep it clear and within the word limit.
