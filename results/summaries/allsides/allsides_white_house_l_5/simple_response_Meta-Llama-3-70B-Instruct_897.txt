SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is demanding that President Obama release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in altering "talking points" about the Benghazi attack to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda. The altered talking points were used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, who claimed the attack originated from a protest, contradicting the intelligence community's conclusion that it was a terrorist attack. Boehner also wants the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official that refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter, but Boehner's demands suggest a lack of trust in the administration's transparency. The moral framing of this issue highlights the importance of accountability and truthfulness in government, as well as the need for transparency in the face of tragedy.
