SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is demanding that President Obama release emails that allegedly show the White House's involvement in altering "talking points" about the Benghazi attack to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, and that this was done to avoid accountability for missing early warnings. The Obama administration has acknowledged altering the talking points to preserve classified information and avoid impacting the FBI investigation. However, Boehner argues that emails reveal that a senior State Department official had already identified the attackers as "Islamic terrorists" the day after the attack, contradicting the administration's narrative. Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned" in investigating the matter, but Boehner's demands for transparency and accountability suggest that the administration is still trying to cover up its mistakes.

END OF SUMMARY.
