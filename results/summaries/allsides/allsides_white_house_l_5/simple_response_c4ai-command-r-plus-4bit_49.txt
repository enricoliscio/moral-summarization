SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails related to the Benghazi attack and the subsequent alteration of talking points used by US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice. Boehner alleges that the White House and State Department deliberately removed references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda to avoid embarrassment, while the Obama administration claims they only altered the talking points to protect classified information and the ongoing FBI investigation. Boehner also revealed the contents of an email from a top State Department official, Beth Jones, sent the day after the attack, which referred to "Islamic terrorists." The State Department has maintained that they defined the attack as a terrorist act since September 12. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to leave no stone unturned in the investigation and ensure appropriate discipline for any culpability. Boehner's demands and the ongoing investigation highlight the moral imperative of transparency and accountability in the wake of a tragic incident that cost American lives.
END OF SUMMARY.
