Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Benghazi attack and the emails involved. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Boehner calling for the release of emails related to the talking points used by Susan Rice. He claims the White House made changes to downplay extremist links, which the report says was to avoid embarrassment. The State Department and White House have different accounts about why the talking points were altered.

I need to capture the conflict between Boehner's accusations and the administration's stance. Also, the email from Beth Jones is important because it shows the State Department knew it was a terrorist attack before Rice's statements.

I should structure the summary to highlight Boehner's call for transparency, the findings of the House report, the email details, and the responses from Kerry and the administration. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure the moral implications are clear, like the potential cover-up and the desire for accountability.

Let me make sure I include all the essential elements without getting bogged down in too much detail. The summary should flow logically, starting with Boehner's call, then the report's findings, the email evidence, and the ongoing investigation.

SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has demanded the release of emails related to the 2012 Benghazi attack, claiming they show the White House altered talking points to downplay extremist links, allegedly to avoid embarrassment. A House GOP report accused the administration of removing references to al-Qaeda-linked groups from intelligence community drafts. Boehner highlighted an email from State Department official Beth Jones, sent September 12, 2012, stating the attack was carried out by Islamic terrorists, which contradicted Susan Rice's later characterization as a spontaneous protest. The State Department maintains it defined the attack as terrorist from September 12, while the White House has acknowledged altering talking points to protect classified information. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to thoroughly investigate and address accountability. Boehner's call for transparency underscores the ongoing debate over whether the administration misled the public. END OF SUMMARY.
