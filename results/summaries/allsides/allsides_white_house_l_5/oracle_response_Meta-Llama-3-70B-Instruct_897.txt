SUMMARY:

House Speaker John Boehner is calling on President Obama to release emails that allegedly show the White House's attempts to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points" to avoid embarrassment. Boehner claims that senior White House officials directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al Qaeda, ignoring the fact that four Americans were left dead. The altered talking points were used by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, who claimed the attack originated from a protest outside the compound. However, the intelligence community later revealed that the violence was actually a terrorist attack. Boehner is also demanding the disclosure of an email from a top State Department official, which refers to "Islamic terrorists" as carrying out the attack. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has vowed to "leave no stone unturned” in investigating the matter and answering questions about the attack. Kerry promises to handle any culpability appropriately and put the issue "to bed.”

END OF SUMMARY.
