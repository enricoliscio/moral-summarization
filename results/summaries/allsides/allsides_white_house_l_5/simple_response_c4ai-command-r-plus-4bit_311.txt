SUMMARY: House Speaker John Boehner has called on President Obama to release emails that, he argues, show the White House's attempt to alter the Benghazi attack "talking points." Boehner alleges that the White House directed changes to the talking points to remove references to extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda and protect the State Department from embarrassment. This contradicts the Obama administration's claim that changes were made only to protect classified information and the FBI investigation. Boehner also revealed the content of an email from a State Department official, sent the day after the attack, referring to "Islamic terrorists." The State Department, however, maintained that they had defined the violence as a terrorist attack since September 12. Secretary of State John Kerry vowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure accountability for any culpability. This request for transparency and accountability from Boehner is a moral imperative to uphold truth, transparency, and justice for the victims of the Benghazi attack and their families.
