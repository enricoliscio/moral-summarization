SUMMARY:
Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, but serious illness can occur. To keep schools safe, the most important thing is for communities to control the coronavirus through adhering to the three W's and strategic testing, isolation, and contact tracing. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. In areas where the virus is under good control, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures. These measures include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk, and modifying essential services. For example, large in-person student assemblies will be stopped, and recess can continue if students play outdoors in small groups, wear masks, and observe physical-distancing guidelines. By following these measures, a better fall is possible for schools. END OF SUMMARY.
