SUMMARY: While COVID-19 typically causes mild illness in children, serious cases do occur, similar to influenza, which claims the lives of over 100 children annually. Therefore, adhering to safety protocols is crucial in schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Firstly, shielding the most vulnerable, such as older staff and children with underlying health conditions, by allowing them to participate remotely is essential when community transmission is high. Secondly, reducing risks by avoiding large gatherings, altering cafeteria operations, and keeping hallway doors open can minimize contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. Essential services like in-school meals must continue, while libraries and other facilities may require capacity restrictions. Activities that increase infection risk, such as group singing, should be discontinued, while outdoor physical activities with masks and distancing can continue. The key to safe schools lies in communities effectively controlling the virus through mask-wearing, handwashing, social distancing, and comprehensive testing and contact tracing strategies. These measures, along with CDC guidelines, will enable schools to reopen safely, tailored to the specific needs of each locality and the evolving understanding of the virus. However, in areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may not be feasible.
