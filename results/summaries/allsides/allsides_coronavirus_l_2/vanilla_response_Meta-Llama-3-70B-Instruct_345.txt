SUMMARY:

Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, and the risk of death is low. However, serious illness can occur, and schools should take measures to control the spread of the virus. The most important factor in keeping schools safe is community control of the virus. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which include eight basic safety measures. These measures include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and modifying essential services. Large in-person student assemblies, cafeterias, and group singing should be stopped or modified. Recess and physical-education classes can continue if students play outdoors in small groups, wear masks, and observe physical-distancing guidelines. Team sports may be too risky. Localities should develop solutions tailored to their unique needs and based on the latest information on the virus.
