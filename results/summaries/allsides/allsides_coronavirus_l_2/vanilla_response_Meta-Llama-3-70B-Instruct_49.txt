SUMMARY:

Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, but serious illness can occur. Closing schools is not necessarily the solution, as the key to keeping schools safe lies in controlling the coronavirus in the community. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which include eight basic safety measures. These measures include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and modifying essential services. Large in-person student assemblies, cafeterias, and group singing will need to stop or be modified. However, some activities like recess and physical-education classes can continue with precautions. In areas where the coronavirus is under good control, band and orchestra practice may be able to continue. The most important thing is for communities to control the coronavirus through measures like mask-wearing, hand-washing, and social distancing.
