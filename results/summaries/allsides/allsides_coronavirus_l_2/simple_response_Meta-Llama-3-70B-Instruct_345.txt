SUMMARY:

The risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 in children is low, similar to influenza. Closing schools is not necessary, as the key to keeping them safe lies in community control of the virus. Adhering to the three W's (wear a mask, wash your hands, watch your distance) and implementing strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine measures can help contain the virus. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which localities must adapt to their unique contexts. In areas with low community transmission, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures, including shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risk, and modifying essential services. This approach prioritizes the well-being of students, staff, and the community, while also acknowledging the importance of in-person learning.
