Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about reopening schools during COVID-19, and I have to make sure the moral framing is preserved. The article talks about the risk of severe illness in children being low, but still, schools need to take precautions. It mentions that closing schools isn't necessary because of COVID-19, similar to how we don't close them for influenza. The key point is community control of the virus through the three W's and other measures. The CDC has guidelines, and each locality can adapt them. The summary should include the main points: low risk in kids, community control is crucial, CDC guidelines, specific safety measures like shielding vulnerable people, reducing risks, and modifying activities. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral aspect is clear, like the importance of community efforts and prioritizing vulnerable groups.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the low risk of severe COVID-19 illness in children compared to older adults, emphasizing that schools don't need to close as they do for influenza. The key to safe reopening lies in community control of the virus through mask-wearing, handwashing, distancing, and strategic measures like testing and isolation. The CDC provides guidelines adaptable to local contexts. Schools should prioritize shielding vulnerable individuals, such as older staff and those with health conditions, and implement safety measures like reducing in-person gatherings, modifying cafeteria use, and limiting surface contact. Essential services like school meals should continue, while activities like choir rehearsals and team sports may need adjustments. Reopening is feasible in most areas with proper precautions, focusing on community responsibility and protecting the most vulnerable. END OF SUMMARY.
