Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The article talks about COVID-19 in children and reopening schools. The author mentions that severe illness in kids is rare, but there are still risks. They compare it to influenza, which also affects kids but schools don't close for that. The main point is that controlling the virus in the community is key, using the three W's and other measures. They also outline eight safety measures for schools.

The moral words to keep are: keep, control, testing, isolation, tracing, quarantine, services, reopening, shield, out, reduce, keeping. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. I should structure it to first mention the rarity of severe illness in kids, then the comparison to flu, the importance of community control, and the specific measures for schools. I'll need to make it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me start by stating the rarity and comparison. Then explain the community control measures, using the three W's and other terms. Then outline the eight measures, using the moral words like shield, reduce, etc. Make sure each key point is covered without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, but serious cases do occur, similar to influenza, which kills many children annually without closing schools. The key to keeping schools safe lies in controlling the virus in the community through the three W’s—wear masks, wash hands, watch distance—and measures like testing, isolation, tracing, and quarantine, which require providing services to prevent disease spread. The CDC offers guidelines for reopening schools, tailored to local contexts. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may be difficult, but most schools should reopen with eight safety measures: shielding vulnerable groups, reducing risks by modifying activities like assemblies, cafeterias, and sports, and ensuring essential services continue. By following these steps, schools can reopen safely while keeping students and staff protected. END OF SUMMARY.
