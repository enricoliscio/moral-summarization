SUMMARY:
Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, but serious illness can occur. To keep schools safe, it's essential to control the coronavirus in the community by adhering to the three W's and implementing strategic testing, isolation, and contact tracing. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. In areas with low community transmission, schools should reopen by following eight basic safety measures. These measures include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and modifying essential services. For example, large in-person student assemblies and choir rehearsals must stop, but recess and physical-education classes are possible if students play outdoors in small groups, wear masks, and observe physical-distancing guidelines. By following these measures, a better and safer fall is possible for schools. END OF SUMMARY.
