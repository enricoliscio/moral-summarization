SUMMARY:
While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, the risk of death is significantly higher for older adults. Schools should implement safety measures to reopen safely. Firstly, it is important to shield the most vulnerable, such as children, older staff, and those with underlying health conditions, from in-person attendance unless community transmission is low. Schools should enable remote participation for these individuals as much as possible. 

Secondly, schools should reduce risk wherever possible by avoiding large gatherings, adjusting cafeteria operations, and reducing surfaces touched by multiple people. Essential services such as in-school meals will continue, while others like libraries will be modified with capacity restrictions. Activities that increase risk, such as group singing and team sports, should be avoided, while recess and physical education can continue with safety measures in place. 

The most critical factor in keeping schools safe is the control of the coronavirus in the wider community. This includes adhering to preventive measures like mask-wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing, as well as effective testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. CDC guidelines provide a framework for reopening, but localities must tailor their solutions based on their unique needs and the evolving understanding of the virus. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may not be feasible, but in most districts, schools should aim to reopen by implementing these safety measures.
