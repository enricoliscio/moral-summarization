SUMMARY:
Keeping schools safe during the COVID-19 pandemic requires a responsible approach. While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, it's essential to take necessary measures to control the spread of the virus. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which involve adhering to the three W's: wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance. Communities must work together to control the virus, providing supportive services and alternative temporary housing to prevent the spread of disease. In schools, it's necessary to shield the most vulnerable, such as children and staff with underlying health conditions, by enabling remote participation. By reducing risk wherever possible, such as by closing cafeterias and restricting large gatherings, schools can provide a safe environment for students. With a responsible and supportive approach, a better fall is possible. END OF SUMMARY.
