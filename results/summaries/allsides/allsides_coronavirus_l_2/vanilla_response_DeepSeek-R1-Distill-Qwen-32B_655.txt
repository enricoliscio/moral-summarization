Alright, I need to summarize this article about COVID-19 in schools. Let me read through it first.

The article starts by saying that severe COVID-19 in kids is rare, much less deadly than in older adults. It compares it to influenza, which also affects children but we don't close schools for that. So the main point is that schools shouldn't necessarily close because of COVID-19.

Next, it mentions that controlling the virus in the community is key. They talk about the three W's: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. Also, strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine support are important.

The CDC has guidelines for reopening schools, but each state and district needs to adapt them. In areas with high spread, in-person schooling might not be possible, but most places should aim to reopen safely.

The article lists eight safety measures. First, protect the most vulnerable: kids, older staff, and those with health issues should stay remote if there's any community transmission. Second, reduce risks by avoiding large gatherings, maybe closing cafeterias, using prepackaged meals, keeping doors open to minimize touching surfaces. Essential services like school meals should continue, but others like libraries might have capacity limits.

Activities like choir rehearsals and team sports might be too risky. Recess and PE can happen outdoors with masks and distancing.

So, the summary should cover the rarity of severe COVID in kids, the comparison to flu, community control, CDC guidelines, tailored solutions, and the eight safety measures. Keep it under 200 words, starting with SUMMARY: and ending with END OF SUMMARY.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and includes all the key points without going into too much detail. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main idea is included.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 in children is rare, with a much lower risk of death compared to older adults. While rare, serious complications like inflammatory syndrome can occur, similar to influenza, which kills many children annually but doesn't lead to school closures. The key to safe school reopening lies in community control of the virus through the three W's—wear masks, wash hands, watch distance—and measures like strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC provides guidelines for reopening schools, which should be adapted to local contexts. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may be challenging, but most districts should aim to reopen safely. Eight basic measures include shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks through modified activities, and limiting high-risk events like choir rehearsals and team sports. Outdoor recess and PE with masks and distancing are possible. END OF SUMMARY.
