SUMMARY: While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, the risk of death from the coronavirus for infected children is significantly higher compared to older adults. To ensure the safe reopening of schools, it is crucial to focus on controlling the spread of the virus within the wider community. This involves adhering to preventive measures such as wearing masks, hand washing, and physical distancing, as well as effective testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC has provided guidelines for schools to reopen safely, and localities should tailor their strategies based on their unique needs and the latest information on the virus. Key measures include shielding the most vulnerable individuals, reducing risks through modified practices such as prepackaged meals and keeping doors open, and maintaining safety protocols during activities like recess and physical education. By following these guidelines and adapting to local conditions, schools can work towards providing a safe environment for students and staff while managing the risks associated with COVID-19.
