SUMMARY:

While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, it's crucial to take precautions to ensure schools remain safe. Closing schools isn't necessary, but controlling the coronavirus in the community is key. Adhering to the three W's (wear a mask, wash your hands, watch your distance) and implementing strategic testing, isolation, and contact tracing is vital. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which localities must adapt to their unique needs. In areas with low community transmission, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures, including shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risk, and modifying essential services. This includes alternatives to large assemblies, cafeteria closures, and capacity restrictions in libraries. By prioritizing safety and community control, we can minimize the risk of COVID-19 in schools and ensure a better fall for our children.
