Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article discusses COVID-19's impact on children, school reopenings, and safety measures. I should focus on the key points: low risk for children, comparison with influenza, community control measures, CDC guidelines, and specific safety measures for schools. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me structure it by highlighting the main ideas and ensuring the moral aspect of responsible reopening is clear.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, with a much lower risk of death compared to older adults. While rare complications like inflammatory syndrome can occur, similar risks exist with influenza, which kills many children annually, including those infected in schools. Schools don’t close for influenza, so similar considerations apply to COVID-19. The key to safe school reopenings lies in community-wide virus control through the three W’s (wear masks, wash hands, watch distance) and strategic measures like testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC has provided guidelines tailored to local contexts. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may be challenging, but in most cases, schools should reopen with basic safety measures. These include shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks through modified activities, and avoiding high-risk gatherings. Essential services like school meals should continue, while others may need adjustments. Outdoor activities with masks and distancing are encouraged, but team sports may remain risky. By prioritizing community control and implementing targeted safety measures, schools can reopen responsibly while protecting health and education. END OF SUMMARY.
