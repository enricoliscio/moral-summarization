SUMMARY:

While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, it's crucial to take measures to keep schools safe. Closing schools isn't necessary, but controlling the virus in the community is key. Adhering to the three W's (wear a mask, wash your hands, watch your distance) and implementing strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine is vital. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. In areas with low community transmission, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures. These include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and modifying essential services. Group singing, large choir rehearsals, and team sports may be too risky, but outdoor recess and physical-education classes can continue with precautions. By prioritizing safety and community control, we can ensure a better fall for our children.
