SUMMARY: 

Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, but it's crucial to keep our schools safe. The key to achieving this lies not within the schools themselves, but in how well communities control the coronavirus. Adhering to the three W's - wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance - and implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, complete contact tracing, and supportive quarantine are essential. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. In areas where the virus is spreading rapidly, in-person schooling may not be possible. However, in most districts, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures. These include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and modifying essential services. By doing so, we can keep our schools safe and ensure a better fall.
