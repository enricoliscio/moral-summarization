SUMMARY:

While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, it's crucial to take measures to keep our schools safe. The key to controlling the spread of the virus lies not within the schools, but in the community's ability to adhere to the three W's: wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance. By doing so, we can box in the virus through strategic testing, effective isolation, complete contact tracing, and supportive quarantine, providing essential services to those in need. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. To ensure a safe return to in-person schooling, schools should shield the most vulnerable, reduce risk wherever possible, and modify essential services. This includes enabling remote participation for high-risk individuals, reducing large gatherings, and implementing physical distancing measures. By taking these steps, we can keep our schools safe and provide a better fall for our children. END OF SUMMARY.
