SUMMARY: Keeping schools safe from COVID-19 requires controlling the coronavirus throughout the community. This involves adhering to health protocols such as wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining physical distance, as well as implementing strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantineâ€”providing services and support for those who need it. Reopening schools safely also depends on tailoring solutions to local needs and following basic safety measures. Shielding the most vulnerable, such as older staff and students with underlying health conditions, is crucial. Schools should enable them to participate remotely if there is community transmission. Reducing risk is also important, with large assemblies and cafeterias potentially replaced by smaller gatherings and prepackaged meals. Keeping schools open requires continuous effort and adaptation, but it is possible if communities prioritize controlling the virus and protecting the well-being of students and staff.
