Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the underlying messages.

The article starts by stating that severe COVID-19 in children is rare, and the risk of death is much lower than in older adults. It mentions a rare inflammatory syndrome but compares it to influenza, which kills more children annually, especially in schools. The author argues that we don't close schools for influenza, so we shouldn't necessarily close them for COVID-19 either. 

The main point seems to be that the focus should be on community control of the virus rather than school closures. The author emphasizes the "three W’s" and other measures like testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine support. They also mention CDC guidelines for reopening schools, tailored to local contexts.

The article then outlines eight safety measures for schools, including shielding vulnerable groups, reducing risks by modifying activities, and stopping certain events like large choirs. It also notes that team sports might be too risky but suggests alternatives like outdoor PE classes with masks and distancing.

So, the moral framing here is about balancing safety with the importance of education and community well-being. The author is arguing against over-reliance on school closures and advocating for a proactive approach in controlling the virus in the community. They present a measured approach, suggesting that while some precautions are necessary, schools should reopen safely rather than closing them outright.

I need to make sure the summary captures this balance, highlighting the rarity of severe cases in children, the comparison to influenza, the emphasis on community control, and the specific safety measures for schools. The summary should reflect the author's stance that school closures aren't the only solution and that other measures can keep schools safe.

I should structure the summary to first state the rarity of severe COVID-19 in children, then compare it to influenza. Then, mention the importance of community control and the three W’s. Finally, outline the key safety measures for schools, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words.

Let me try to draft this, making sure to include all the key points without losing the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The article highlights that severe COVID-19 in children is rare, with a much lower risk of death compared to older adults. It draws a parallel to influenza, which annually kills more children, including those infected in schools, yet schools remain open. The author argues that school closures should not be the primary response to COVID-19, emphasizing instead community control of the virus through the "three W’s" (wear masks, wash hands, watch distance), strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC provides guidelines for safely reopening schools, tailored to local contexts. Key safety measures include shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks by modifying activities like cafeteria use and group singing, and considering outdoor PE classes with masks and distancing. The focus is on balancing education continuity with health safety, advocating for proactive community measures over school closures. END OF SUMMARY.
