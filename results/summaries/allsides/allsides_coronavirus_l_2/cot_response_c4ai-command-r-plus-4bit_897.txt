SUMMARY: Reopening schools safely is critical. While severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, the risk is not zero. The most important thing to do to ensure safe schools is to control community spread of the virus. This involves adhering to public health guidelines such as wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing. The CDC has released guidelines for reopening schools, which should be applied by each state and school district according to their unique context. Shielding the most vulnerable, such as older staff and children with underlying health conditions, is necessary. In-person assemblies, cafeterias, and group singing should be avoided to reduce risk. Essential services like in-school meals must continue, with modifications to reduce contact. Recess and physical education are possible if students play outdoors in small groups, wear masks, and observe physical distancing guidelines. Team sports, however, are risky and should be avoided due to reported clusters of cases. Following these basic safety measures is critical to keeping schools open and protecting vulnerable individuals. Localities need to develop solutions to safely reopen schools, but in areas of high community transmission, it may be difficult or impossible to do so. END OF SUMMARY.
