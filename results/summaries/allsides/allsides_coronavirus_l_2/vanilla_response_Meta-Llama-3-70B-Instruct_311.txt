SUMMARY:

While COVID-19 can cause severe illness in children, the risk of death is low. However, controlling the spread of the virus in the community is key to keeping schools safe. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which include eight basic safety measures. First, shield the most vulnerable by enabling remote participation for high-risk individuals. Second, reduce risk by eliminating large assemblies, modifying cafeterias, and reducing surfaces touched by multiple people. Essential services like in-school meals will continue, while others like libraries and choir rehearsals may need modifications. In areas with good control, band and orchestra practice may continue, while team sports may be too risky. Recess and physical education classes can proceed with outdoor play, masks, and physical distancing. By following these measures, schools can reopen safely.
