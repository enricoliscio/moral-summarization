SUMMARY: Reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic requires careful consideration of safety measures to protect students, staff, and the wider community from the risk of infection. While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, it is still morally imperative to implement measures that control the spread of the virus and shield the most vulnerable members of our society. 

The first and most important step is for communities to control the coronavirus through adherence to public health guidelines such as wearing masks, handwashing, and physical distancing. In addition, strategic testing, effective isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine are crucial to boxing in the virus and preventing its spread. 

When it comes to schools, several safety measures are necessary to reduce the risk of infection. Shielding the most vulnerable, such as older staff and students with underlying health conditions, should be a priority. In-person assemblies and large group activities, including choir rehearsals and team sports, may pose too high a risk and should be avoided. Reducing the number of surfaces touched by multiple people and modifying essential services, such as providing prepackaged meals and capacity restrictions in libraries, are also important considerations. 

While these measures may present difficulties and challenges, they are possible and essential to ensuring a better and safer learning environment for our children during this pandemic.
