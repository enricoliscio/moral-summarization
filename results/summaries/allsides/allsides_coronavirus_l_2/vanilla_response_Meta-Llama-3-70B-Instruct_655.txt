SUMMARY:

Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, but serious illness can occur. To keep schools safe, controlling the coronavirus in the community is key. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which include eight basic safety measures. First, shield the most vulnerable by enabling remote participation. Second, reduce risk by avoiding large assemblies, closing cafeterias, and reducing touched surfaces. Essential services like in-school meals will continue, while others like libraries may need capacity restrictions. Group singing and team sports may be too risky, but outdoor recess and physical-education classes can continue with masks and distancing. In areas with good control, band and orchestra practice may be possible. By following these measures, schools can reopen safely. Localities must develop solutions tailored to their unique needs and based on the latest virus information.

END OF SUMMARY.
