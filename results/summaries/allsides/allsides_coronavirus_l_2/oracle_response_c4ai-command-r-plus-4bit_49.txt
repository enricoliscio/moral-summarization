SUMMARY: Keeping schools safe from COVID-19 requires controlling the coronavirus throughout the community. This means adhering to health guidelines such as wearing masks, washing hands, and physical distancing, as well as implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, contact tracing, and providing quarantine services to those who need them. Reopening schools safely also depends on following crucial safety measures. First, shielding the most vulnerable, such as older staff and students with underlying health conditions, by enabling them to participate remotely if there is community transmission. Second, reducing risk by avoiding large gatherings, modifying meal services, and keeping classrooms and hallways safe. By controlling the virus and implementing these safety measures, we can strive to reopen schools while keeping our most vulnerable students and staff shielded from harm and reducing the overall risk of infection.
