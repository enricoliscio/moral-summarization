SUMMARY: While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, the risk of serious illness and death from the virus in schools still exists. To keep schools safe, the most important thing is to control the spread of the virus in the community. This includes adhering to public health measures such as mask-wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing, as well as implementing effective testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine strategies. The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools, but local communities will need to adapt them to their specific needs and the latest information on the virus. In areas with high community transmission, in-person schooling may not be possible, but in most districts, schools can reopen safely by following safety measures such as shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk through physical distancing and changes to school routines, and providing alternative options for students who cannot attend in person. Keeping schools safe relies on controlling the spread of the virus in the community and adapting to the changing needs and conditions of the pandemic.
