SUMMARY:
Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, but serious illness can occur. To keep schools safe, it's important to control the coronavirus throughout the community by adhering to the three W's and implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, and complete contact tracing. The CDC has released helpful guidelines for safely reopening schools, which each state and school district must apply to their unique context. In places where the virus is spreading explosively, it may be difficult or impossible to have in-person schooling. However, in most school districts, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures, including shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and continuing essential services. By taking these steps, a better fall is possible. END OF SUMMARY.
