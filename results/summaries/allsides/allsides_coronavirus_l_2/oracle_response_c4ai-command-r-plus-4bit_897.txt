SUMMARY: Keeping schools safe from COVID-19 requires controlling the coronavirus throughout the community. This entails adhering to preventive measures such as wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining physical distance, as well as implementing strategic testing, effective isolation of infected individuals, contact tracing, and providing supportive quarantine services to prevent further spread. Reopening schools safely is possible by following essential safety measures. Firstly, shielding the most vulnerable, such as allowing children and staff with underlying health conditions to participate remotely if there is community transmission. Secondly, reducing risks by avoiding large assemblies, modifying cafeterias, and reducing commonly touched surfaces. Essential services like in-school meals will continue, while libraries and other spaces will have capacity restrictions. Group singing and team sports are considered high-risk and may need to be replaced with outdoor physical activities following physical distancing guidelines. The CDC's guidelines provide a framework for local authorities to tailor solutions based on their specific contexts and the latest information on virus control. The success of reopening schools relies on the community's ability to control the virus and implement protective measures effectively.
