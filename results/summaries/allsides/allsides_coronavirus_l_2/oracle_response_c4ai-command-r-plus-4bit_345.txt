SUMMARY: Keeping schools safe during the pandemic requires controlling the coronavirus in the wider community. This involves adhering to public health measures such as wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing, as well as implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantineâ€”providing services to those who need to isolate or quarantine. 

The CDC has released guidelines for reopening schools safely, and localities will need to adapt these guidelines to their specific contexts and needs. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may not be possible, but in most districts, schools should aim to reopen by following key safety measures. 

The first priority is to shield the most vulnerable members of the school community, such as older staff and children with underlying health conditions. They should not return to in-person schooling unless community transmission is low or non-existent, and remote learning options should be provided for them. 

The second priority is to reduce risk wherever possible. This includes canceling large student assemblies and modifying or restricting certain services, such as closing cafeterias and limiting library capacity. Schools should also reduce the number of surfaces touched by multiple people and encourage outdoor activities for recess and physical education, with small groups, masks, and physical distancing. 

By following these measures, we can work towards reopening schools while keeping our communities safe.
