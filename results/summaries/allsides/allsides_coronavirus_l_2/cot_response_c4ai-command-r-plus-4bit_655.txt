SUMMARY:
Reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic can be safe if communities take the necessary measures to control the spread of the virus. While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, the risk of serious illness and death does exist, just as it does with influenza. To keep schools safe, the most important thing is to control the coronavirus throughout the community by adhering to health protocols such as wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing. Additionally, strategic testing, effective isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine are crucial. 

The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools, which should be applied based on local contexts and unique needs. Shielding the most vulnerable, such as older staff and children with underlying health conditions, is paramount. Schools should enable them to participate remotely if there is community transmission. Reducing risk is also essential; large assemblies, cafeterias, and group singing should be avoided, while recess and physical education can continue with precautions. Essential services like in-school meals must be maintained, while libraries and other facilities may require capacity restrictions. 

By following these safety measures, most school districts can reopen safely most of the time. However, in areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may not be feasible. The key to keeping schools safe lies in the community's ability to control the virus and reduce the risk of transmission.
