SUMMARY: Keeping schools safe during the COVID-19 pandemic requires controlling the spread of the virus within communities. While closing schools is not necessary, implementing safety measures is important. Shielding the vulnerable, reducing risk, and ensuring essential services continue are key. Large gatherings, cafeterias, and group singing are risky and should be avoided. In-school meals and libraries must be modified to reduce contact. Sports may be too risky, but recess and physical education are possible with precautions. Following these basic safety measures is essential to keeping schools safe and open. Localities need to adapt these measures to their specific needs and context, and in areas with high community transmission, in-person schooling may be difficult or impossible. By controlling the virus and implementing these safety measures, we can keep our schools safe and give our children the education they deserve.
