Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I keep the moral framing the author provided. Hmm, let's see. The article is about COVID-19 and schools, right? The main points are that severe illness in kids is rare, but it's not zero. They compare it to influenza, which also kills some kids, especially in schools, but we don't close schools for flu. So the author is making a moral argument that we shouldn't close schools just because of COVID-19 either, especially since the risk is lower.

The author also emphasizes that the key to keeping schools safe isn't just about what happens inside the schools, but how the community controls the virus. They mention the three W's: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. Plus, strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine support. So the moral here is about community responsibility and not just school policies.

The CDC guidelines are mentioned, but each state needs to adapt them. So it's about local autonomy and using the latest info. They also list eight safety measures: shielding the vulnerable, reducing risks by changing school activities, continuing essential services like meals, modifying others like libraries, stopping group singing, maybe stopping sports, and allowing recess with precautions.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral points: the comparison to flu, the focus on community control, the balance between safety and not overreacting, and the practical steps schools can take. I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all these elements.

Let me structure it: start with the rarity of severe COVID-19 in kids, compare to flu, argue against closing schools, mention community control as key, outline the three W's and other measures, mention CDC guidelines and local adaptation, list the eight measures briefly, and conclude with the balance between safety and education.

I think that covers the main points and the moral framing. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and flows well.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the rarity of severe COVID-19 illness in children, emphasizing that the risk of death is much lower compared to older adults. It draws a moral comparison to influenza, which also causes child deaths annually but doesn't lead to school closures. The author argues that schools shouldn't close solely due to COVID-19, highlighting that community-wide virus control is the most critical factor. This involves adhering to the three W's (wear masks, wash hands, watch distance) and implementing strategic measures like testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC provides guidelines for reopening schools, which should be adapted locally based on current data. The article outlines eight safety measures for schools, including shielding vulnerable individuals, modifying activities like cafeteria use and group singing, and allowing recess with precautions. The moral framing underscores the importance of balancing safety with the need to keep schools open, avoiding overreaction, and focusing on community responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
