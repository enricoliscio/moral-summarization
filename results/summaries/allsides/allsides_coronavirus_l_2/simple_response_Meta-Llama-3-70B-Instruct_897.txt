SUMMARY:

While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, it's crucial to take measures to keep schools safe. The key to safe reopening lies not within the schools themselves, but in the community's control of the virus. By adhering to the three W's and implementing strategic testing, isolation, and contact tracing, communities can box in the virus. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which localities must adapt to their unique contexts. In areas with low community transmission, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures. These include shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risk, and modifying essential services. For example, large assemblies and choir rehearsals should be stopped, while outdoor recess and physical-education classes can continue with masks and physical distancing. By prioritizing community control and adapting to local contexts, schools can reopen safely and provide a better fall for students.
