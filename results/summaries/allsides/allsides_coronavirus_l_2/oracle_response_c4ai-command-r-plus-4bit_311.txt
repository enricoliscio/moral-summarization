SUMMARY: Keeping schools safe during the COVID-19 pandemic requires controlling the coronavirus within the community. To achieve this, communities must adhere to health protocols such as wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining physical distance, along with implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantineâ€”providing services and support to those who need to isolate or quarantine. The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools safely, which each community must adapt to their specific context and needs. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may not be feasible, but for most communities, reopening schools is achievable by following safety measures. Shielding the most vulnerable, such as older staff and children with underlying health conditions, is crucial. Schools should enable them to participate remotely if in-person attendance poses a risk. Reducing risk should be prioritized, including avoiding large gatherings, altering cafeteria practices, and keeping hallway doors open to minimize touched surfaces. Essential services like in-school meals must continue, while libraries and other facilities may require capacity restrictions. Recess and physical education can continue with masks, small groups, and physical distancing.
