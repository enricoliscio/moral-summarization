SUMMARY:

The risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 in children is low, similar to influenza. Closing schools is not necessary, as the key to keeping them safe lies in community control of the virus. By adhering to the three W's (wear a mask, wash hands, watch distance) and implementing strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, communities can reduce the spread of COVID-19. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which localities must adapt to their unique contexts. To reopen safely, schools should shield vulnerable individuals, reduce risk by modifying activities and services, and implement measures such as remote participation, reduced assemblies, and physical distancing. By prioritizing community control and adapting to local circumstances, schools can reopen safely and provide essential services to students.

END OF SUMMARY.
