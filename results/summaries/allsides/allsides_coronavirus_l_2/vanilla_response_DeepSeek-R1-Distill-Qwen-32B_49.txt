Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer. They provided an article about COVID-19 in children and school reopenings. My task is to summarize this article concisely, within 200 words, and format it with "SUMMARY:" at the start and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It starts by stating that severe COVID-19 in children is rare compared to older adults. It mentions the rare inflammatory syndrome but compares it to influenza, which also affects children and isn't a reason to close schools. The article emphasizes that school safety depends more on community control of the virus through the three W's: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. It also talks about strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine support.

The CDC has guidelines for reopening schools, which vary by location. In areas with high transmission, in-person schooling might not be feasible, but generally, schools should follow eight safety measures. These include shielding vulnerable groups, reducing risks by modifying activities like assemblies, cafeteria use, and extracurriculars, and focusing on outdoor activities with masks and distancing.

I need to condense all this into a summary. I'll start by mentioning the rarity of severe COVID-19 in children. Then, compare it to influenza and the community control measures. Highlight the CDC guidelines and the eight safety measures, focusing on vulnerable groups, reducing risks, and outdoor activities. Make sure it's under 200 words and properly formatted.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, ensure that all key points are included without going into too much detail. Let me structure it: start with the main point about children, then community control, then the guidelines and specific measures. That should cover everything succinctly.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, with death rates far lower than in older adults. While rare inflammatory syndromes can occur, they are comparable to complications from influenza, which often kills more children annually without prompting school closures. The safety of schools depends on community-wide virus control, achieved through mask-wearing, handwashing, social distancing, strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine measures. The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools, which should be tailored to local conditions. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may be challenging, but most schools can reopen safely by following eight key measures: shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks through modified activities like remote learning for high-risk groups, limiting large gatherings, adjusting cafeteria use, and prioritizing outdoor activities with masks and distancing. END OF SUMMARY.
