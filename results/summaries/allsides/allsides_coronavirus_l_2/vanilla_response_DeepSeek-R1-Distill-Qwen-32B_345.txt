Alright, I need to summarize this article about reopening schools during COVID-19. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by noting that severe COVID-19 in kids is rare, but serious cases do happen, similar to influenza. It mentions that we don't close schools for flu, so maybe the same approach applies here. The key point is that controlling the virus in the community is crucial, not just what happens in schools. They mention the three Ws: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. Also, testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine support are important. 

The CDC has guidelines, but each state and school district needs to adapt them. In areas with high transmission, in-person school might not be possible. Otherwise, schools should reopen with eight safety measures. The first is shielding the most vulnerable, like older staff and those with health issues, allowing them to participate remotely. Second, reducing risks by avoiding large gatherings, closing cafeterias, using prepackaged meals, and minimizing touched surfaces. Essential services like school meals must continue, but others like libraries need capacity limits. Group singing and team sports might be too risky, but outdoor activities with masks and distancing could work.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the rarity of severe COVID in kids, the comparison to flu, community control being key, the three Ws, CDC guidelines, and the eight safety measures. I'll make sure to mention the vulnerable groups, reducing risks, essential services, and specific activities that might be restricted or allowed.

Let me structure it: start with the main point about severity, then community control, the three Ws, CDC guidelines, and the eight measures. Each measure can be a brief point. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together clearly and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 in children is rare, though serious cases, like the recent inflammatory syndrome, do occur, similar to influenza. Schools don't close for flu, so COVID-19 shouldn't necessarily require closure either. The key to safe reopening is community control of the virus through the three Wâ€™s: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance, plus strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC provides guidelines, but localities must adapt them to their context. In areas with explosive spread, in-person schooling may be difficult. Otherwise, schools should reopen with eight safety measures: shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks by avoiding large gatherings, closing cafeterias, using prepackaged meals, minimizing touched surfaces, continuing essential services like school meals, modifying libraries, stopping group singing, and limiting team sports. Outdoor activities with masks and distancing may be allowed. END OF SUMMARY.
