Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. The article is about reopening schools during COVID-19, emphasizing community control measures and specific safety guidelines.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It starts by stating that severe COVID-19 in children is rare compared to older adults. It compares this to influenza, which also kills children but doesn't lead to school closures. The key point is that the most important factor in keeping schools safe is community control of the virus through the three Ws: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. Additionally, it mentions testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine with support services.

The author then outlines the CDC guidelines for reopening schools, which include shielding vulnerable groups, reducing risks by modifying school activities, and implementing specific safety measures. They also mention that in areas with high transmission, in-person schooling might not be feasible, but in most cases, schools should reopen with these measures.

The user has specified that I must preserve the morally framed words they've listed: keep, control, testing, isolation, tracing, quarantine—providing, services, reopening, shield, out, reduce, keeping. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary without making it too long—under 200 words.

I should start by highlighting the rarity of severe COVID-19 in children and compare it to influenza, noting that schools don't close for flu. Then, stress the importance of community control measures and the three Ws. Mention the need for strategic testing, isolation, tracing, and quarantine with services. Then, outline the CDC guidelines, including shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks by modifying school activities, and the importance of local solutions based on the latest data.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the main point about community control, then moving into the guidelines for schools, and ending with the conclusion about the feasibility of reopening in most cases. I should also use the specified moral words to maintain the framing.

I should check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered concisely while incorporating the moral terms.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, but controlling the virus in communities is key to keeping schools safe. The three W’s—wear masks, wash hands, watch distance—along with strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine, are essential to boxing in the virus. The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools, emphasizing shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks through modified activities, and implementing basic safety measures. Schools should enable remote participation for high-risk groups, limit large gatherings, and adjust facilities to minimize touchpoints. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may be difficult, but most schools should aim to reopen safely. Activities like group singing, team sports, and large gatherings may need to stop, while outdoor activities with masks and distancing can continue. Local solutions tailored to unique needs and the latest data are crucial for a safe return to in-person learning. END OF SUMMARY.
