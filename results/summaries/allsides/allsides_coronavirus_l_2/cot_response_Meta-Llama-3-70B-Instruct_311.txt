SUMMARY:
While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, serious illness can occur, just like with influenza. However, we don't close schools because of the risk of influenza, and we don't necessarily need to close them because of the risk of COVID-19. The single most important thing we can do to keep our schools safe is to control the coronavirus throughout the community by adhering to the three W's and implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, complete contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. In places where the virus is spreading explosively, it may be difficult or impossible to have in-person schooling. But in most school districts most of the time, schools should look to reopen by following eight basic safety measures, including shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and enabling essential services to continue. By taking these steps, a better fall is possible. END OF SUMMARY.
