SUMMARY:

While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, serious illness can occur. However, we don't need to close schools due to the risk of COVID-19, just as we don't close them due to the risk of influenza. The key to keeping schools safe lies in how well communities control the coronavirus throughout the community. This requires adhering to the three W's and implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, complete contact tracing, and supportive quarantine - providing services and alternative temporary housing to prevent the spread of disease. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. To keep schools safe, we must shield the most vulnerable, reduce risk wherever possible, and modify essential services. This includes enabling remote participation for high-risk individuals, reducing in-person assemblies, and implementing physical distancing measures. By following these safety measures, we can keep our schools safe and ensure a better fall.
