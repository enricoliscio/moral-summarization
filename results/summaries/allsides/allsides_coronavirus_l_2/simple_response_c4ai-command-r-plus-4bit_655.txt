SUMMARY: While COVID-19 typically causes mild illness in children, serious cases do occur, underscoring the importance of community-wide infection control to ensure safe school reopening. Effective measures include wearing masks, handwashing, physical distancing, strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC has provided guidelines for schools, which should be adapted locally. In areas with high virus transmission, in-person schooling may not be feasible, but in most districts, schools can reopen safely by implementing eight key safety measures. First, shield vulnerable individuals by enabling remote learning for at-risk students and staff. Second, reduce risks by avoiding large gatherings, modifying meal services, keeping hallway doors open, and restricting library capacity. Singing and team sports should be avoided, but outdoor recess and physical education with masks and distancing are possible.
