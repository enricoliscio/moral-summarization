Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about reopening schools during COVID-19, focusing on safety measures and community control of the virus. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author mentions that severe COVID-19 in children is rare, but there are risks, similar to influenza. They argue against closing schools just because of COVID-19, emphasizing community control through the three W's: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. They also talk about strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine with support services.

The author provides guidelines from the CDC for reopening schools, tailored to each locality. They list eight basic safety measures: shielding the vulnerable, reducing risks by modifying school activities, and other precautions like outdoor activities with masks.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: keep, control, testing, isolation, tracing, quarantine—providing, services, reopening, shield, out, reduce, keeping. I should incorporate as many of these as possible into the summary without making it too wordy.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the rarity of severe illness in children, then the comparison to influenza, the argument against closing schools, the importance of community control, and the specific measures. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll start by stating the main point about the rarity and the comparison, then move into the community control measures, and finally the school-specific actions.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each moral word is included naturally. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's message while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, with death risk much lower than for older adults. While rare, serious cases like the inflammatory syndrome do occur, similar to influenza, which kills many children annually. Schools don’t close for influenza, so they don’t necessarily need to close for COVID-19. The key to keeping schools safe is community control of the virus through the three W’s—wear masks, wash hands, watch distance—and strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, with supportive services. The CDC provides guidelines for safely reopening schools, which should be tailored to local needs. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may be difficult, but in most cases, schools should reopen with eight basic safety measures. First, shield vulnerable individuals, including children, older staff, and those with high-risk health conditions, allowing remote participation if needed. Second, reduce risks by modifying activities like large assemblies, cafeteria use, and food preparation. Essential services like school meals should continue, while others like libraries and choirs may need adjustments. Team sports may be too risky, but recess and PE can continue outdoors with masks and distancing. END OF SUMMARY.
