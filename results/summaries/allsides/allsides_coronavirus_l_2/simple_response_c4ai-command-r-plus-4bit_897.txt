SUMMARY: Returning to school in the era of COVID-19 raises difficult ethical questions. While children are at low risk of severe illness or death from the coronavirus, they can still become infected and spread the disease to more vulnerable individuals in their households and communities. The ethical dilemma arises when weighing the benefits of in-person education against the potential harm of disease transmission. To address this challenge, schools should implement comprehensive safety measures that protect the well-being of students, staff, and the wider community. This includes shielding the most vulnerable, such as those with underlying health conditions, by providing remote learning options. Additionally, schools should reduce risks wherever possible by modifying activities that involve close contact, such as large assemblies or choir rehearsals. By following guidelines and adapting to local conditions, schools can strive for a balance that prioritizes both education and public health. Ultimately, the success of reopening schools relies on the collective efforts of communities to control the spread of COVID-19 through mask-wearing, handwashing, social distancing, and effective testing and tracing strategies. Together, these measures can help create a safer environment for students to return to the classroom while mitigating the ethical concerns surrounding the pandemic's impact on children's education and well-being.
