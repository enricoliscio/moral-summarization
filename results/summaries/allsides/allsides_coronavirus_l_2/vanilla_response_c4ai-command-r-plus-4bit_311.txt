SUMMARY: The article discusses the importance of weighing the risks and benefits when it comes to reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, the article emphasizes that the single most important factor in keeping schools safe is controlling the spread of the virus in the community. This includes adhering to public health measures such as mask-wearing, handwashing, physical distancing, and strategic testing. The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools, and localities will need to adapt these guidelines to their specific contexts and needs. The article outlines eight safety measures that schools can implement to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, including shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk through physical distancing and modified services, and ensuring proper ventilation and hygiene practices. It is acknowledged that in areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may not be feasible, but in most communities, schools should aim to reopen by following these safety protocols.
