Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about COVID-19 in children, mentioning that severe illness is rare. It compares the risk to influenza, which also causes some child deaths each year but doesn't lead to school closures. The key point is that keeping schools safe depends more on community efforts than school policies. They mention the three Ws: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. Also, strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine support are important.

The CDC has guidelines for reopening schools, which vary by location. Schools should follow eight basic safety measures. These include shielding vulnerable people, reducing risks by avoiding large gatherings, modifying cafeteria use, and limiting contact points. Essential services like meals continue, but other activities like choir rehearsals and team sports might be restricted. Outdoor activities with masks and distancing are safer.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating that severe COVID-19 in kids is rare, compare to flu, and mention community control is key. Then, outline the three Ws and other strategies. Mention CDC guidelines and the eight safety measures briefly, highlighting vulnerable groups, risk reduction, and activity modifications.

I should ensure the summary is concise, captures all main points without going into too much detail. Also, make sure it flows logically from one point to the next.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, with death risk much lower than for older adults. While rare serious cases occur, similar to influenza, which kills many children annually, schools typically remain open. The primary factor in school safety is community-wide virus control through the three Wâ€™s: wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining distance, along with strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine support. The CDC provides guidelines for reopening schools, which vary by location. Schools should follow eight safety measures, including shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks by avoiding large gatherings, modifying cafeteria use, and limiting contact points. Essential services like meals continue, while activities like choir rehearsals and team sports may be restricted. Outdoor activities with masks and distancing are safer. END OF SUMMARY.
