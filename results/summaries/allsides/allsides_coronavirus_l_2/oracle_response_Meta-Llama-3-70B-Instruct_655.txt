SUMMARY:

While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, it's crucial to take measures to keep schools safe. The key to controlling the coronavirus lies not within schools, but in the community's ability to adhere to the three W's: wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance. Strategic testing, effective isolation, complete contact tracing, and supportive quarantine are essential to boxing in the virus. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. To keep schools safe, eight basic safety measures should be followed. First, shield the most vulnerable by enabling remote participation. Reduce risk by eliminating large assemblies, closing cafeterias, and modifying essential services. In areas with good control, some activities like band practice may continue, while others like team sports may be too risky. By following these measures, we can keep our schools safe and reopen them responsibly. END OF SUMMARY.
