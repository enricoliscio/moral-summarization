SUMMARY:

The risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 in children is low, but serious illness can still occur. Closing schools is not necessarily the solution, as the key to keeping schools safe lies in community control of the coronavirus. Adhering to the three W's (wear a mask, wash your hands, watch your distance) and implementing strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine measures can help control the virus. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. In areas with low community transmission, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures, including shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risk, and modifying essential services. This can include remote participation for high-risk individuals, reducing in-person assemblies, and implementing physical distancing measures in recess and physical education classes. By following these measures, schools can reopen safely.
