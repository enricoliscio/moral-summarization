SUMMARY: While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, the risk of serious illness and death from the virus in schools still exists. To keep schools safe, the most important thing is to control the spread of the virus in the community. This includes adhering to public health guidelines such as wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing, as well as implementing strategic testing and contact tracing. The CDC has released guidelines for reopening schools, and localities will need to adapt these guidelines based on their specific context and the latest information on the virus. In areas with high community transmission, in-person schooling may not be possible, but in most districts, schools can reopen safely by following eight basic safety measures. These measures include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk through physical distancing and limiting large gatherings, and providing essential services such as in-school meals. Recreational activities like sports and choir rehearsals may need to be modified or stopped altogether to reduce risk. By following these safety measures and closely monitoring the situation, schools can reopen safely and adapt to changing conditions.

END OF SUMMARY.
