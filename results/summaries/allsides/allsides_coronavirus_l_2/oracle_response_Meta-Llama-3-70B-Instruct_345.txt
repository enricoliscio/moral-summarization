SUMMARY:

Severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, but serious illness can occur. To keep our schools safe, it's essential to control the coronavirus throughout the community by adhering to the three W's and implementing strategic testing, effective isolation, complete contact tracing, and supportive quarantineâ€”providing services and alternative temporary housing. The CDC has released guidelines for safely reopening schools, which must be tailored to each locality's unique needs. In places where the virus is spreading explosively, in-person schooling may be impossible. However, in most districts, schools can reopen by following eight basic safety measures. These include shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk wherever possible, and modifying essential services. This can be achieved by keeping hallway doors open, reducing surfaces touched by multiple people, and observing physical-distancing guidelines during recess and physical-education classes. By taking these measures, we can keep our schools safe and ensure a better fall.
