SUMMARY: While severe illness from COVID-19 in children is rare, the risk of infection and serious illness in schools still exists. However, closing schools is not necessarily the solution, as the safety of schools depends primarily on the control of the virus in the wider community. To reopen schools safely, communities must adhere to preventive measures such as wearing masks, hand washing, and physical distancing, as well as effective testing, isolation, contact tracing, and supportive quarantine. The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools, and each locality must adapt these guidelines to their specific needs and the latest information on the virus. In areas with explosive virus spread, in-person schooling may not be possible, but in most districts, schools can reopen by implementing safety measures. These measures include shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risk through measures like limiting assemblies and altering cafeteria practices, and continuing essential services with modifications. Recess and physical education can continue with small groups, masks, and physical distancing. Team sports and group singing, however, pose higher risks and may need to be discontinued.
