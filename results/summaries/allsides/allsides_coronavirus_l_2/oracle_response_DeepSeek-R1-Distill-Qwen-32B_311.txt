Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points. 

The article starts by saying that severe COVID-19 in kids is rare, much less deadly than for older adults. It compares it to influenza, which kills many children each year, yet schools don't close for flu. The key point is that keeping schools safe isn't just about what happens inside but how well the community controls the virus. The author mentions the three W's: wear masks, wash hands, watch distance. Also, they talk about strategic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, including providing services and housing. 

The CDC has guidelines for reopening schools, which vary by location. In areas with high transmission, in-person schooling might not be possible. Otherwise, schools should follow eight safety measures. These include shielding vulnerable people, reducing risks by avoiding large gatherings, modifying activities like meals and libraries, stopping group singing, and possibly halting team sports. Recess and PE can continue outdoors with masks and distancing.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the author's morally framed words as possible: keep, control, testing, isolation, tracing, quarantine, providing, reopening, shield, out, reduce, keeping.

I need to make sure these words are included. Let me structure the summary to cover the main points using these words. Start with the rarity of severe COVID in kids, compare to flu, then the importance of community control. Mention the three W's, testing, isolation, tracing, quarantine, and services. Then talk about CDC guidelines and the eight measures: shielding the vulnerable, reducing risks, modifying activities, stopping group singing, team sports, and allowing recess with precautions.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral word is included where appropriate.

SUMMARY: Severe COVID-19 in children is rare, with a much lower risk of death compared to older adults. While rare, serious cases like the inflammatory syndrome do occur, similar to influenza, which kills many children annually without prompting school closures. The focus should be on community control of the virus through the three W’s—wear masks, wash hands, watch distance—and strategies like testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, including providing necessary services. Schools should reopen safely by following CDC guidelines tailored to local conditions. In areas with high transmission, in-person schooling may be challenging, but in most cases, schools should reopen using eight safety measures: shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risks by avoiding large gatherings, modifying activities like meals and libraries, stopping group singing, and possibly halting team sports. Recess and PE can continue outdoors with masks and distancing. END OF SUMMARY.
