SUMMARY: The risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 in children is rare, but it is still important to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus in schools. The key to keeping schools safe is to control the spread of the virus in the community through mask-wearing, handwashing, social distancing, and effective testing, isolation, and contact tracing. The CDC has released guidelines for reopening schools, and local communities will need to adapt these guidelines to their specific needs and contexts. In areas with high community transmission, in-person schooling may not be possible, but in most areas, schools can reopen safely by following safety measures such as shielding the most vulnerable, reducing risk through physical distancing and mask-wearing, and providing alternatives to activities that increase risk, such as large assemblies or choir rehearsals. Essential services such as in-school meals can continue with modifications, and recess and physical education can take place outdoors with small groups and physical distancing.
