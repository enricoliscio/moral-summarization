Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about COVID-19 in children, comparing it to influenza and arguing against closing schools. It emphasizes community control of the virus and specific safety measures. 

First, I'll identify the main points: low risk of severe illness in kids, comparison to influenza, the importance of community measures, the three W's, CDC guidelines, and specific school safety measures. 

I should make sure to highlight the moral argument against closing schools, similar to how we don't close them for flu. I'll need to mention the key strategies and the eight safety measures briefly. 

I'll structure the summary to start with the low risk, then the community control, followed by the guidelines and specific measures. Keep it under 200 words and end with the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: The article highlights that severe COVID-19 illness in children is rare, with the risk of death being significantly lower than for older adults. It compares the situation to influenza, which kills many children annually, yet schools remain open. The author argues that closing schools is unnecessary, emphasizing that the primary focus should be on community-wide virus control through the three Wâ€™s: wearing masks, washing hands, and maintaining distance. The CDC has provided guidelines for reopening schools safely, which should be adapted to local contexts. In areas with high transmission, in-person schooling may be challenging, but in most cases, schools should reopen with eight basic safety measures, including shielding vulnerable individuals, reducing risk through modified activities, and avoiding large gatherings. The article underscores the importance of prioritizing community control over the virus to ensure school safety. END OF SUMMARY.
