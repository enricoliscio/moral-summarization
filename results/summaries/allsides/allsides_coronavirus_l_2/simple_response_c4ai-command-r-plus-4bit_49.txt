SUMMARY: While COVID-19 typically causes mild illness in children, severe cases and even death can occur, underscoring the importance of community efforts to control the virus. School reopening decisions should be based on local virus control and tailored to each community's unique needs. The CDC has provided guidelines, and schools can implement safety measures such as remote learning for vulnerable students and staff, reducing large gatherings, adjusting meal services, and promoting good hygiene practices. Essential services like in-school meals must continue, while libraries and other activities may need modifications. Outdoor recess and physical education are recommended with masks and distancing. The key to safe school reopening is controlling community virus transmission through mask-wearing, handwashing, social distancing, and effective testing and isolation strategies. These measures are crucial to protecting our children and educators as we navigate the challenges of the pandemic.
