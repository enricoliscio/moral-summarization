SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program, intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were individuals with past arrests but no convictions. Some were arrested during traffic violations or had their charges dropped, yet still ended up in federal immigration detention and deportation proceedings. Only one quarter of those targeted had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault, while the most common conviction was for drunk driving. This raises concerns about the program's focus on "criminal aliens" and its impact on community policing. Undocumented immigrants like Maria Sotomayor fear that the program's "detainers" will deter victims of crime from reporting to the police, undermining public safety. Critics argue that the program is not keeping anyone secure and is merely a name change from its predecessor, Secure Communities. END OF SUMMARY.
