SUMMARY: An analysis of US deportation practices reveals a concerning trend. The Priority Enforcement Program, intended to target the "worst of the worst" immigrants for deportation, is missing its mark. Many individuals with no criminal convictions are being swept up in the net, triggered by simple arrests or traffic violations. The data shows that only a quarter of those targeted had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) claims to have narrowed its criteria to focus on convicted criminals and those threatening public safety and national security. However, their actions suggest otherwise, with a slightly higher rate of targeting people with no criminal record. This has fueled concerns about a humanitarian crisis, as well as the security and protection of immigrants. Advocates suspect the program is little more than a name change, with new detainer forms targeting those without convictions. The program's implementation falls short of its stated objectives and raises questions about the morality of targeting vulnerable individuals and communities. ICE's practices are criticized for undermining community policing needs and creating an environment of fear. END OF SUMMARY.
