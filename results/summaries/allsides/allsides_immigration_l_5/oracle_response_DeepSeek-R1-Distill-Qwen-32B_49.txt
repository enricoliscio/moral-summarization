Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and how it's not working as intended. The author uses words like 'holds','missing', 'violating', 'crisis', etc., so I need to include those as much as possible.

First, I should identify the main points. The article says that many 'holds' in PEP are on people without convictions, which is a problem because the program was supposed to target the 'worst of the worst'. It mentions that half of the holds were on people with arrests but no convictions, some for minor offenses like traffic violations. The report from Syracuse University shows that only a quarter had serious crimes like murder or assault, with drunk driving being the most common conviction. ICE claims they're focusing on threats to public safety but data shows they're targeting more people without criminal records. The article also discusses the humanitarian crisis caused by mass deportations and the impact on community trust, with immigrants fearing to report crimes. There's criticism that PEP isn't much different from the previous program and might just be a name change.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words: 'holds','missing', 'violating', 'crisis', 'committing','murder', 'assault', 'conviction', 'felonies','misdemeanor', 'targets', 'threaten', 'implementing', 'crime', 'immigration', 'change'.

I'll structure the summary by stating the program's intent, the issue with holds on non-convicted individuals, the types of offenses, ICE's claims versus the data, the humanitarian crisis, and the criticism about the program's effectiveness and name change.

I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms.

SUMMARY: The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to target "criminal aliens" for deportation, is missing its mark. Many "holds" placed on immigrants are for past arrests without convictions, including traffic violations or dropped charges, leading to federal detention and deportation. A Syracuse University report reveals only a quarter of those held had serious offenses like murder or assault, with drunk driving being the most common conviction. ICE claims PEP focuses on threats to public safety, but data shows it targets more people without criminal records. The program has fueled a humanitarian crisis, as immigrants fear reporting crimes due to detention risks. Critics argue PEP is similar to the previous Secure Communities program, with ICE using new detainer forms to hold non-criminal immigrants, undermining its stated goals. END OF SUMMARY.
