SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the so-called "holds" were placed on people who had been arrested but had no criminal conviction, with some having been picked up during traffic violations or having their charges dropped. Only a quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses. This raises concerns that the program is fueling a humanitarian crisis, as many immigrants are being targeted and deported without having committed any serious crimes. The program's implementation is also being questioned, as it may be falling short of its intended goal of prioritizing the deportation of serious offenders. Critics argue that the program is not keeping anyone secure and is instead creating a culture of fear among immigrants, who may be hesitant to report crimes for fear of being detained and deported.
