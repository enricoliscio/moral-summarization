Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications mentioned.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE, intended to deport "criminal aliens." However, the report shows that many of those targeted have no convictions, just arrests. This raises moral concerns about fairness and the impact on communities.

I notice the author uses words like 'holds,''missing,' 'violating,' 'fueled,' 'crisis,' etc. I need to include these to maintain the moral tone. The program is supposed to target the worst offenders but ends up deporting people with minor or no offenses, which is a moral failure.

I should highlight the misuse of resources, the humanitarian crisis, and how this affects trust in law enforcement. Also, the mention of sanctuary cities and the resistance from local agencies adds to the ethical debate.

I'll structure the summary to first state the program's intention, then the issue with targeting, the consequences, and the criticism from advocates. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise but include all key moral points.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the problem, the data, the impact, and the criticism. This way, the moral framing is clear and preserved as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to deport "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for individuals with past arrests but no convictions, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. Only a quarter had committed serious crimes like murder or assault. The program, introduced to replace Secure Communities, claims to focus on felons or multiple misdemeanors, but data shows ICE now targets people with no criminal records at a higher rate. Critics argue the program fuels a humanitarian crisis, as immigrants fear reporting crimes due to detention risks. Sanctuary cities resist PEP, and advocates suspect it is merely a rebranded version of the previous program. The use of new detainer forms for non-convicted immigrants further raises ethical concerns about fairness and public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
