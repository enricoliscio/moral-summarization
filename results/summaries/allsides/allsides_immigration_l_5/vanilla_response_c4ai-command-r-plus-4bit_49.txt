SUMMARY: A new report reveals that a program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is falling short of its goal. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which aims to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," has been found to target individuals with no criminal convictions, including those arrested for traffic violations or with charges dropped. The analysis also showed that only a quarter of those detained had committed serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault. This misalignment between the program's intent and its outcomes has raised concerns among immigration advocates and underscores the need for a more refined approach that focuses on convicted criminals and those who pose a threat to public safety. Despite ICE's claims of making strides towards a more targeted enforcement strategy, the data suggests that the PEP program may not be significantly different from its predecessor, Secure Communities, which contributed to a high number of deportations under the Obama administration. Critics argue that the program's implementation falls short of its stated goals and may even hinder community policing efforts by deterring immigrants from reporting crimes. END OF SUMMARY.
