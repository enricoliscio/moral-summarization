Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and its issues. The main points are that many 'holds' are on people without convictions, leading to deportations despite not being serious criminals. The moral issues here are targeting innocent people, undermining community trust, and the ineffective nature of the program. I should highlight how this affects vulnerable communities and the criticism from advocates. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral concerns are clear.

SUMMARY: A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," often targets individuals with no criminal convictions, including those arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations or with dropped charges. The analysis, conducted by Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, found that half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for people without convictions, and only a quarter had committed serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. The most common convictions were for drunk driving and minor offenses. Despite claims that PEP focuses on "the worst of the worst," data shows ICE now targets people without criminal records at a slightly higher rate than before. Critics argue the program undermines community trust, as immigrants may avoid reporting crimes for fear of detention. Immigration advocates suspect PEP is merely a rebranded version of the Secure Communities program, which led to mass deportations under Obama. The report highlights the humanitarian crisis caused by mass deportations and questions the program's effectiveness in ensuring public safety or national security. END OF SUMMARY.
