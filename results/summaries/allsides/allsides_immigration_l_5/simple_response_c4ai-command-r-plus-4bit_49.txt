SUMMARY: A program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is missing its target, according to a recent report. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which was designed to focus on the deportation of "criminal aliens" with serious convictions, has resulted in the detention and deportation of many immigrants with no criminal record or only minor offenses. This misalignment between the program's stated goals and its outcomes has raised concerns among immigration advocates and highlights the potential for unintended consequences, such as deterring immigrants from reporting crimes for fear of deportation. The program's implementation also reveals a disconnect between federal and local authorities, with many local law enforcement agencies refusing to honor detention requests from immigration authorities. This discrepancy between the program's stated goals and its actual impact underscores the complex and controversial nature of immigration enforcement in the United States, and the need for a careful consideration of the ethical implications of such policies.
