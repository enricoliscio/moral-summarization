SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens", is missing its target. An analysis of requests by federal officials found that half of the "holds" were placed on people who had been arrested but had no criminal conviction. Many had been picked up during traffic violations or had their charges dropped. Only one quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. The most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses. This contradicts Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) claims that it has narrowed the criteria to focus on "criminal aliens" convicted of felonies or several misdemeanor offenses. Critics argue that the program is not keeping anyone secure and may be deterring immigrants from reporting crimes.

END OF SUMMARY.
