SUMMARY: A program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, known as the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), is reportedly missing its target. An analysis of federal requests to hold immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law found that half of the 'holds' were placed on individuals with no criminal convictions, and many had only been arrested for minor offenses such as traffic violations. This indicates that ICE is targeting people with no criminal record, contrary to their stated priorities. The program has fueled concerns about a humanitarian crisis, as it may deter immigrants from reporting crimes for fear of deportation. Local law enforcement agencies have refused to honor ICE requests to hold immigrants, citing concerns about the impact on community safety and policing needs. Immigration advocates have also raised doubts about the effectiveness of the program, suggesting that it may be little more than a name change from previous efforts that contributed to a high number of deportations. The use of 'holds' and detainer forms for individuals with no criminal record or security risk raises questions about the true nature and impact of the PEP program.
END OF SUMMARY.
