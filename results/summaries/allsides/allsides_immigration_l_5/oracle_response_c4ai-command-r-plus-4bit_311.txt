SUMMARY: A report reveals that a program intended to prioritize the deportation of 'criminal aliens', known as the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), may be missing its target. The program aims to expedite the deportation of immigrants with criminal convictions, but an analysis found that half of the 'holds' placed on individuals had no criminal conviction. Many had only been arrested, with charges dropped or minor offenses such as traffic violations. This indicates that ICE may be falling short of its stated goal to focus on convicted criminals and those who threaten public safety. The program has led to the detention and deportation of individuals with no criminal record or minor offenses, raising concerns about the impact on immigrant communities and public safety. Immigration advocates suspect that PEP may be just a name change from previous programs, with ICE continuing to target non-criminal immigrants through new detainer forms. This suggests that the program may not be fulfilling its intended purpose of prioritizing enforcement resources on convicted criminals and those who pose a threat to public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
