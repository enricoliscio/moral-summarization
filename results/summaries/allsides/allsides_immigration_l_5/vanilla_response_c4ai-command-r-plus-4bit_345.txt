SUMMARY: A report reveals that a program aimed at prioritizing the deportation of "criminal aliens" is falling short of its goal. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to target immigrants with criminal convictions, has resulted in the detention and deportation of many with no convictions or only minor offenses. An analysis found that only 25% of those detained had committed serious crimes, while the majority had been arrested for traffic violations or drunk driving. This misalignment between the program's goals and its outcomes has led to criticism and concerns about the impact on immigrant communities. Despite ICE's claims of focusing on convicted criminals, the data suggests an increased rate of targeting people with no criminal record. Immigration advocates have also raised doubts about the effectiveness of PEP, suggesting it may be a rebranding of previous programs that resulted in mass deportations. The program has fueled debates about public safety, community policing, and the rights of undocumented immigrants.
END OF SUMMARY.
