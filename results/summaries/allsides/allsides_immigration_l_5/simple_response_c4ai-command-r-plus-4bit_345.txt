SUMMARY: A program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is falling short of its goal, according to a recent report. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which was supposed to focus on deporting "criminal aliens" with serious convictions, has instead resulted in the detention and potential deportation of many immigrants with no criminal record or only minor offenses. This misalignment between the program's stated goals and its actual effects has raised concerns among immigration advocates and highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of US immigration policy. Furthermore, the program may be undermining public safety by creating fear and distrust of law enforcement within immigrant communities. Despite these issues, ICE claims that it is making progress in prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals and those who pose a threat to public safety and national security. However, the actual implementation of PEP and its impact on undocumented immigrants and their families suggest otherwise.

END OF SUMMARY.
