SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were on people with past arrests but no convictions. Many were picked up during traffic violations or had their charges dropped. Only one quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. The most common conviction was for drunk driving. Despite claims of narrowing criteria, ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. This raises concerns about the program's focus on "criminal aliens" and its impact on community policing, as undocumented immigrants may be deterred from reporting crimes due to fear of deportation. The report's findings cast doubt on the program's effectiveness and raise questions about its true intentions.

END OF SUMMARY.
