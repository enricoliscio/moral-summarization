SUMMARY:
A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens", is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for those with past arrests but no convictions, including traffic violations and dropped charges. Only a quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common convictions were for drunk driving and simple traffic offenses. This raises concerns about the program's focus on "criminal aliens" and its impact on community policing needs. Immigrant advocates argue that the program is not keeping anyone secure and may even deter victims of crimes from reporting to the police. The report's findings suggest that the PEP program may be falling short of its intended goals, prioritizing deportation over public safety and national security. END OF SUMMARY.
