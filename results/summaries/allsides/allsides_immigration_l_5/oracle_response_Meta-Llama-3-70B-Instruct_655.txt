SUMMARY:

A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens", is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were individuals with past arrests but no convictions. Many were arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations, and their charges were later dropped. Only a quarter of those targeted had committed serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common convictions were for drunk driving and miscellaneous assaults. This raises concerns about the program's effectiveness in prioritizing the deportation of "the worst of the worst". Critics argue that the program is not keeping anyone secure, and is instead creating a humanitarian crisis. The program's focus on "criminal aliens" is also being questioned, as it targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. END OF SUMMARY.
