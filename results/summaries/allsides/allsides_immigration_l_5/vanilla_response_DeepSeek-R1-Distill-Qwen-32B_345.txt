Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and its issues. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article mentions that many 'holds' under PEP are on people with past arrests but no convictions. That's a key point. The program aims to deport the "worst of the worst," but half the holds are on non-convicted individuals. Some were picked up for minor offenses or had charges dropped. This is important because it shows the program isn't targeting the intended criminals.

The report from Syracuse University's TRAC found that only a quarter had serious offenses like murder. Most common convictions were for drunk driving or simple traffic offenses. This indicates that PEP is not focusing on the most dangerous individuals as intended.

ICE claims they've narrowed their criteria from the Secure Communities program, which led to high deportations under Obama. But recent data shows ICE is targeting people without criminal records more than before. This is a contradiction to their stated goals.

ICE's spokeswoman said they focus on public safety and national security, but critics argue it's not effective. An undocumented immigrant, Maria Sotomayor, mentioned that victims might avoid reporting crimes due to detainers, affecting community safety.

Before PEP, 377 agencies refused some ICE detainer requests. Now, 17 of the top jurisdictions are participating. This shows some progress but maybe not enough.

The article also notes that unauthorized immigration has decreased, with 11.3 million people in the US without legal status. Obama deported over 2.5 million, but his executive orders protected some. Advocates are suing for more transparency on PEP, suspecting it's just a name change from the old program. They found ICE can still request custody of non-criminal immigrants, making the program seem ineffective.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main issues: PEP's failure to target serious criminals, targeting of non-convicted individuals, ICE's claims vs. reality, critics' concerns, and the broader context of immigration trends and advocacy efforts.

Let me structure it: start with the report's findings, mention the types of offenses, ICE's response, the impact on community safety, participation from law enforcement, and the criticism from advocates. Keep it concise, ensuring each key point is included without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," is failing to target its intended focus. Half of the immigration "holds" placed on individuals were for those arrested but not convicted, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. Only a quarter of cases involved serious crimes, such as murder or sexual assault. ICE claims PEP narrows its focus to convicted criminals, but data shows it now targets non-criminal immigrants slightly more than before. Critics argue the program undermines community safety, as undocumented victims may avoid reporting crimes due to fear of detention. Despite this, 17 of the top jurisdictions with high detainer declines are now participating. Advocates suspect PEP is merely a rebranded version of the previous Secure Communities program, with ICE still requesting custody of non-criminal immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
