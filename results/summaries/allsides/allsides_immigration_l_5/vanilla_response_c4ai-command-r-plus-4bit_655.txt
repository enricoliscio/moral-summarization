SUMMARY: A report reveals that a program meant to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is falling short of its goal. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which replaced the Secure Communities program in 2014, was intended to focus on deporting "criminal aliens" with serious convictions. However, an analysis found that half of the deportation requests made by federal officials were for individuals with no criminal convictions, and only a quarter had committed serious offenses. ICE claims that PEP has narrowed its criteria, but data suggests that the rate of targeting individuals with no criminal record has increased slightly. Immigration advocates have raised concerns about the effectiveness and fairness of the program, and some local law enforcement agencies have refused to honor ICE's requests to hold immigrants in detention. The program has led to a humanitarian crisis, with mass deportations and a chilling effect on immigrant communities' trust in law enforcement. Advocates are suing to obtain more details on PEP, suspecting it may be a rebranding of the previous program.
END OF SUMMARY.
