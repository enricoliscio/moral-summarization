SUMMARY:
A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens", is missing its target. Half of the so-called "holds" were placed on people with past arrests but no convictions, including those picked up during traffic violations or with charges dropped. Only a quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common conviction was for drunk driving. This comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) claims it has narrowed the criteria to focus on "criminal aliens" convicted of felonies or several misdemeanor offenses. Critics argue that the program is not keeping anyone "secure" and is actually creating a "humanitarian crisis". The program's implementation has also led to concerns about "sanctuary city" policies and the treatment of "victims" of crime who may be undocumented immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
