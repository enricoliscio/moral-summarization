SUMMARY:
A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program, intended to expedite the deportation of "the worst of the worst" immigrants, is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for those with past arrests but no convictions, often for minor offenses like traffic violations. Only one quarter had committed serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. The program's focus on "criminal aliens" is questionable, as it targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. This has led to a humanitarian crisis, with many immigrants too afraid to report crimes for fear of deportation. The program's claims of prioritizing "convicted criminals" and "individuals who threaten public safety and national security" ring hollow. In reality, it is failing to keep communities secure and is instead perpetuating a crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
