Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE. It's supposed to target 'criminal aliens' for deportation. But the report shows that many of the holds are on people without convictions. They were arrested but not convicted, sometimes for minor offenses like traffic violations or their charges were dropped. This leads to their federal detention and possible deportation.

Only a quarter of those held had serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. The most common convictions were for drunk driving and simple assaults. ICE claims they've narrowed their criteria, but recent data shows they're targeting people without criminal records more than before.

The article also mentions that many local agencies refuse to honor ICE's detainer requests.ICE says they focus on public safety and national security, but critics argue the program isn't effective and discourages immigrants from reporting crimes. There's a lawsuit to get more details on how PEP differs from the previous program, suggesting it's just a name change.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key findings: half of the holds are on non-convicted individuals, ICE's claims vs reality, the impact on immigrants' willingness to report crimes, and the legal challenges. I'll make sure to mention the statistics and the implications for immigration enforcement.

SUMMARY: A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," is targeting individuals without criminal convictions. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants by ICE were for those arrested but not convicted, often for minor offenses like traffic violations. Only a quarter of those held had serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. Despite ICE claiming to focus on public safety, data shows they now target non-criminal immigrants more than before. Critics argue the program discourages immigrants from reporting crimes and is not effectively securing communities. Local agencies are increasingly refusing to honor ICE's detainer requests, and legal challenges question whether PEP differs meaningfully from its predecessor. END OF SUMMARY.
