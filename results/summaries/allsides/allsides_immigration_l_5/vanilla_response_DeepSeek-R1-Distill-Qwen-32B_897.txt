Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about a program called the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE. It's supposed to target "criminal aliens" for deportation, but the report shows that many of the people being detained haven't been convicted of any crimes. Instead, they were arrested but had their charges dropped or were just involved in minor incidents like traffic violations. 

The key points I need to include are:
- The program's intention vs. actual results.
- Half of the holds are on people without convictions.
- The most common convictions were for drunk driving and minor offenses.
- ICE claims they're focusing on serious offenders, but data shows otherwise.
- Immigrants are hesitant to interact with police because of detainers.
- Sanctuary cities and local agencies refusing to cooperate.
- The number of unauthorized immigrants in the US and Obama's record on deportations.
- Critics suspect PEP isn't much different from the previous program.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers these points clearly. I'll structure it by first stating the program's intent, then the report's findings, ICE's response, the impact on immigrants, and the criticism of the program's effectiveness. 

I need to avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Also, mention the implications like the humanitarian crisis and the hesitation among immigrants to report crimes. That should cover the main aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," often targets individuals without criminal convictions. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for arrests without convictions, including traffic violations or dropped charges. Only 25% had serious offenses like murder or sexual assault, with drunk driving being the most common conviction. Despite ICE claiming to focus on serious offenders, data shows an increase in targeting those without criminal records. Critics argue the program fails to prioritize public safety and harms community trust, as immigrants fear detention for reporting crimes. Sanctuary cities and local agencies have refused to cooperate, and advocates suspect PEP is similar to the previous Secure Communities program. The US has about 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants, with net immigration stable since 2010. ICE defends PEP as a "common-sense" approach, but critics say it undermines public safety and fairness. END OF SUMMARY.
