Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and how it's not working as intended. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The PEP was supposed to target "criminal aliens" with serious convictions, but many of the holds are on people without convictions. The author uses words like 'holds','missing', 'violating', etc., which I need to incorporate.

I should start by stating that PEP aims to target the worst offenders but is missing its mark. Then mention that half the holds are on people with arrests but no convictions, including those with dropped charges or traffic violations. Highlight that only a quarter have serious offenses like murder or assault, while most have minor issues like DUIs. 

Next, note that ICE claims to focus on public safety but data shows they're targeting more people without records. Include Maria Sotomayor's point about immigrants fearing to report crimes. Also, mention the sanctuary cities and ICE's efforts to get them on board. Finally, mention the lawsuit questioning if PEP is just a name change and the new detainer forms for non-convicted immigrants, which critics see as ineffective.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to target "criminal aliens" with serious convictions, is missing its mark. Analysis reveals that half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for individuals with past arrests but no convictions, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. Only a quarter of those held had committed serious crimes like murder or assault, while the majority faced minor offenses such as drunk driving or simple assaults. Despite ICE's claims to focus on public safety, data shows the program now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate. Critics argue that PEP undermines community trust, as undocumented immigrants may avoid reporting crimes due to fear of detention. Sanctuary cities have resisted the program, but ICE has convinced some jurisdictions to participate. Legal challenges question whether PEP differs meaningfully from its predecessor, with critics calling it a "name change" and highlighting new detainer forms targeting non-convicted immigrants. The program's moral and practical shortcomings remain unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
