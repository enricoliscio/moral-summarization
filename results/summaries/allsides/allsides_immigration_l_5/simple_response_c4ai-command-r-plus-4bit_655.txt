SUMMARY: A new report reveals that a program meant to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is falling short of its goal. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which was designed to focus on "criminal aliens" with serious convictions, has instead resulted in the detention and deportation of many immigrants with no criminal record or only minor offenses. An analysis of requests for local jails to hold immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law found that half of the "holds" were placed on individuals with no criminal conviction, and only a quarter had committed serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault. This misalignment between the program's stated goals and its actual impact raises concerns about the effectiveness and ethics of the Priority Enforcement Program. Meanwhile, immigration advocates criticize the program as a mere rebranding of previous initiatives, and question ICE's commitment to prioritizing public safety and community policing needs. This highlights the complex and controversial nature of immigration enforcement in the United States.
