Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE, which is supposed to target "criminal aliens" for deportation. But a report found that many of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for people without criminal convictions. They were arrested but not convicted, sometimes for minor offenses like traffic violations or where charges were dropped. This led to their federal detention and possible deportation.

The author uses words like 'holds','missing', 'violating', 'crisis', 'committing','murder', 'assault', 'convictions', 'felonies','misdemeanors', 'targets', 'threaten', 'implementing', 'crime', 'immigration', and 'change'. These words carry moral weight, so I need to include as many as possible.

The article also mentions that only a quarter had serious offenses, with drunk driving being the most common. ICE claims PEP focuses on public safety, but data shows they're targeting people without criminal records more. Immigrants fear reporting crimes because of detainers, affecting community safety. Many jurisdictions refuse to honor detainers, and PEP's effectiveness is questioned by advocates, who suspect it's just a rebranded version of the old program.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points and the moral language. I'll keep it under 200 words, focusing on the misuse of holds, the humanitarian crisis, ICE's claims versus reality, and the impact on immigrants' trust in law enforcement.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to deport "criminal aliens," often targets individuals with past arrests but no convictions, missing its stated goal. Many held under PEP were arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations or had charges dropped, yet faced federal detention and deportation. Only a quarter had serious convictions, such as murder or assault, while the most common offenses were drunk driving and misdemeanors. ICE claims PEP focuses on public safety, but data shows it targets people without criminal records at a higher rate. Immigrants fear reporting crimes due to detainers, undermining community safety. Advocates argue PEP may be a rebranded version of the Secure Communities program, with ICE still requesting custody of undocumented individuals without convictions or security risks. This raises concerns about the program's impact on immigration and public trust. END OF SUMMARY.
