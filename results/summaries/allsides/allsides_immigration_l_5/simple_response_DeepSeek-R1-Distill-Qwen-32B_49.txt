Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article discusses the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE, intended to deport "criminal aliens." However, a report shows that half of the holds were on people without convictions, some even with dropped charges. This means the program is targeting more people than it should, including those who haven't been convicted of serious crimes.

The moral issue here is that the program is not effectively targeting the intended "worst of the worst." Instead, it's detaining individuals who might not pose a threat, which raises concerns about fairness and the impact on communities, especially sanctuary cities. The article also mentions that ICE claims to focus on public safety but data shows they're targeting more non-criminal individuals, undermining trust in law enforcement among immigrant communities.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, highlighting the discrepancy between the program's intent and its execution, the moral implications, and the community's response. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll structure it to first state the program's intent, then the report's findings, followed by the moral concerns and community impacts.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," is failing to target its intended focus. Half of the immigration holds placed by federal officials were on individuals with past arrests but no convictions, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. The most common convictions were for drunk driving and simple assaults, not serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. Despite ICE claiming to focus on public safety, data shows it now targets people without criminal records at a slightly higher rate than before. Critics argue the program undermines trust in law enforcement within immigrant communities, as victims of crimes may hesitate to report incidents due to fear of detention. The report also suggests PEP may not differ significantly from its predecessor, Secure Communities, with ICE using new detainer forms to request custody of undocumented individuals without convictions. Advocates argue this approach is ineffective and morally questionable, as it prioritizes unnecessary detentions over community safety. END OF SUMMARY.
