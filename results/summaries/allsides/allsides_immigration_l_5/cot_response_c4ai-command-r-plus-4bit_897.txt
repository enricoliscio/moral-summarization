SUMMARY: The Priority Enforcement Program, intended to deport "the worst of the worst" criminal aliens, has missed its target, according to a recent report. An analysis revealed that half of the deportation holds were placed on individuals with arrests but no convictions, and many had only committed minor offenses like drunk driving or traffic violations. The program, started in 2008, contributed to a record number of deportations under the Obama administration, but it has been criticized for targeting people with no criminal record at an increasing rate. ICE claims the program prioritizes convicted criminals and individuals who threaten public safety and national security, but immigration advocates argue that it falls short of keeping communities secure. The program also faces legal challenges, as many local law enforcement agencies refuse to honor ICE detainer requests, citing sanctuary city policies that keep ICE and police separate. Unauthorized immigration and unlawful entry into the US remain a concern, with millions living and working without legal status. President Obama has deported more people than any other president while also issuing executive orders to protect some from deportation. Critics suspect the Priority Enforcement Program is just a name change, as it still targets individuals with no criminal convictions. END OF SUMMARY.
