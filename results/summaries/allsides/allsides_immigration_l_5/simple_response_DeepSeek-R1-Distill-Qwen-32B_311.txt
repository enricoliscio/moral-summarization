Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and its issues. Let me read through it again to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that many 'holds' in PEP are on people with past arrests but no convictions. So, they're being detained without a criminal record. That's a moral issue because it's targeting innocent people.

The report by TRAC found that half of the holds were on people without convictions. Some were picked up for minor things like traffic violations or had their charges dropped. This means the program is overreaching and affecting people who shouldn't be targeted.

ICE claims PEP focuses on "criminal aliens" with felonies or multiple misdemeanors, but the data shows they're targeting people with no criminal records more now. That's a contradiction, highlighting a moral failure in the program's implementation.

Maria Sotomayor points out that this makes immigrants afraid to report crimes, which is a community safety issue. It's a moral concern because it undermines trust in law enforcement.

ICE's response is defensive, saying they're making strides, but the data doesn't support that. The new detainer forms allow holding people without convictions, which is another moral problem as it's arbitrary and unjust.

Immigration advocates suspect PEP is just a rebranded version of Secure Communities, which deported a lot of people under Obama. This shows a pattern of problematic enforcement, raising moral questions about fairness and justice.

Unauthorized immigration stats are included to show the scale, but the main moral issue is how the program treats individuals, especially those without convictions.

So, the summary should highlight that PEP is failing to target only serious offenders, detaining many without convictions, undermining community trust, and raising concerns about fairness. It should also mention the criticism that PEP isn't much different from previous programs, continuing the problematic approach.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these moral points without being too technical. I'll structure it to first state the issue, then the findings, the impact on communities, ICE's response, and the criticism from advocates. That should cover the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to deport "criminal aliens," is detaining many individuals with no criminal convictions. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for those arrested but not convicted, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. The most serious offenses, such as murder or sexual assault, accounted for only a quarter of cases. ICE claims PEP focuses on convicted criminals, but data shows it increasingly targets people without criminal records. Critics argue the program undermines community trust, as immigrants may avoid reporting crimes due to fear of detention. Advocates suspect PEP is merely a rebranded version of the controversial Secure Communities program, continuing problematic enforcement practices. END OF SUMMARY.
