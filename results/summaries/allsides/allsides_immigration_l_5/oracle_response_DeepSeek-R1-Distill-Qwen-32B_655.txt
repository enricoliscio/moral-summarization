Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has specified certain morally charged words that should be included, so I should make sure to incorporate those.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE, intended to deport "criminal aliens." However, the report shows that many of the "holds" are on people without convictions, leading to unnecessary detentions and deportations. The author uses words like 'holds,''missing,' 'violating,' etc., which I need to include.

I should start by introducing PEP and its intended purpose. Then, mention that the report found half of the holds were on people without convictions. Highlight that many were arrested for minor offenses or had charges dropped. The moral issue here is that the program is targeting people who aren't the worst offenders, which is a problem.

Next, include the statistics about the types of offenses, like drunk driving and traffic violations. This shows the program isn't focusing on serious crimes. Also, note that ICE claims to have narrowed their criteria but data shows they're targeting more people without records now.

Include the quote from Maria Sotomayor about immigrants fearing to report crimes, which undermines community safety. This is a moral issue because it affects public trust and safety.

Mention the decline in local agencies cooperating with ICE and the lawsuit by immigration advocates questioning if PEP is just a name change. This adds to the critique of the program's effectiveness and fairness.

Finally, wrap it up by stating the program's failure to meet its goals and the ongoing issues with immigration enforcement. Make sure to use the specified moral words throughout the summary.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for individuals with past arrests but no convictions, including those arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations or with dropped charges. The most common convictions were for drunk driving, assaults, and traffic offenses, not serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. Despite claims of narrowing criteria, ICE now targets people without criminal records at a slightly higher rate than before. Critics argue the program undermines public safety, as immigrants may avoid reporting crimes due to fear of detention. Advocates suspect PEP is merely a rebranded version of the previous Secure Communities program, with ICE still requesting custody of undocumented individuals without convictions or security risks. The report highlights the program's failure to focus on its stated priorities, fueling concerns about its impact on communities and immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
