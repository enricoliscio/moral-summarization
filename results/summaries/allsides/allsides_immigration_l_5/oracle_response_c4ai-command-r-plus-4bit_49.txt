SUMMARY: A report reveals that a program meant to prioritize the deportation of 'criminal aliens' is falling short of its target. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to focus on immigrants convicted of felonies or multiple misdemeanors, has resulted in the detention and deportation of many individuals with no criminal convictions. Almost half of those detained had only been arrested, with charges ranging from traffic violations to drunk driving and simple assaults, and in some cases, the charges were dropped. This indicates that the program may be unjustly targeting and punishing individuals who have not been convicted of any crime. Furthermore, immigration advocates suspect that PEP may not be significantly different from its predecessor, Secure Communities, which contributed to a high number of deportations under the Obama administration. ICE claims it is making strides to ensure a common-sense approach that targets convicted criminals and those who threaten public safety, but the data suggests that the agency may be falling short of its stated goals and could be contributing to a humanitarian crisis. The program has also been criticized for potentially discouraging immigrants from reporting crimes for fear of being detained themselves.
END OF SUMMARY.
