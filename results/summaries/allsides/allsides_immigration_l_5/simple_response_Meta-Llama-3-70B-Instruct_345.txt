SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for those with past arrests but no convictions, with many being picked up for traffic violations or having charges dropped. Only a quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common convictions were for drunk driving, miscellaneous assaults, and simple traffic offenses. This contradicts ICE's claim that the program focuses on "criminal aliens" convicted of felonies or multiple misdemeanors. The program's failure to prioritize serious offenders undermines community policing and creates a humanitarian crisis, as immigrants who are victims of crimes may be deterred from reporting them due to fear of deportation.

END OF SUMMARY.
