Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about a program called the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE. It's supposed to target 'criminal aliens' for deportation, but the report shows that many of the people being held have no criminal convictions. Instead, they were arrested but their charges were dropped or they had minor offenses like traffic violations. 

The report mentions that only a quarter of the holds were for serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. Most convictions were for things like drunk driving or simple assaults. ICE claims they've narrowed their criteria, but the data shows they're targeting people without criminal records more than before. 

There's also a part about sanctuary cities and how some law enforcement agencies refuse to honor ICE detainers. Maria Sotomayor, an undocumented immigrant, mentions that victims of crimes might not report because they fear being detained. 

The article also notes that unauthorized immigration in the US has decreased since 2007, and net immigration has been balanced since 2010. Obama deported over 2.5 million people but protected some through executive orders. Advocates are suing to get more details on PEP, suspecting it's similar to the old program, Secure Communities. 

So, the key points are: PEP targets immigrants with no convictions, only a quarter have serious crimes, ICE's claims don't match data, sanctuary cities' resistance, impact on reporting crimes, unauthorized immigration trends, Obama's record, and advocates' skepticism about PEP.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, focusing on the main issues: the program's failure to target only serious criminals, the impact on non-criminals, ICE's response, and the broader context of immigration trends and policy changes.

SUMMARY: A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," often targets individuals with no criminal convictions. Half of the "holds" placed by ICE were on people arrested but not convicted, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. Only a quarter had serious convictions, such as murder or sexual assault. Despite ICE claiming a narrowed focus, data shows an increase in targeting non-criminals. Sanctuary cities resist PEP, with some agencies refusing ICE detainers. Immigrants fear reporting crimes due to detention risks. Unauthorized immigration in the U.S. has stabilized since 2010, with Obama deporting over 2.5 million but protecting some through executive orders. Advocates suspect PEP is similar to the previous Secure Communities program, criticizing its effectiveness. END OF SUMMARY.
