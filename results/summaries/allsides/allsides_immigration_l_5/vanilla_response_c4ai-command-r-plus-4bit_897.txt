SUMMARY: A report has revealed that a program aimed at prioritizing the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is falling short of its target. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which was intended to focus on "criminal aliens" with felony or misdemeanor convictions, has been found to target people with no criminal convictions in half of the cases. Many of those detained had been arrested but not convicted, with some having their charges dropped or being picked up for minor traffic violations. The data also shows that ICE is now detaining people with no criminal record at a higher rate than before. Immigration advocates have criticized the program, claiming that it is not effectively prioritizing the deportation of "the worst of the worst". They argue that the program is not making communities safer and is instead creating a climate of fear and distrust among immigrant communities. ICE has defended its actions, stating that it focuses on convicted criminals and those who threaten public safety, while also considering community policing needs.
