SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. An analysis of requests by federal officials found that half of the "holds" were placed on people who had been arrested but had no criminal conviction. Many were picked up for traffic violations or had their charges dropped, yet were still detained and faced deportation proceedings. Only one quarter of those targeted had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. The most common conviction was for drunk driving. Despite claims of narrowing its criteria, ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. Critics argue that the program is not keeping communities secure and may deter immigrants from reporting crimes to the police.

END OF SUMMARY.
