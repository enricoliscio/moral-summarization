SUMMARY:
A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens", is missing its target. Half of the so-called "holds" were placed on people with past arrests but no convictions, including those picked up during traffic violations or with charges dropped. Only a quarter had committed serious offenses, such as murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common convictions were for drunk driving, miscellaneous assaults, and simple traffic offenses. This raises concerns about the program's focus on "criminal aliens" and its impact on community policing needs. Critics argue that the program's implementation is not keeping anyone secure, and may even deter victims of crime from reporting to the police. The report's findings have sparked controversy, with some arguing that the program is simply a rebranded version of its predecessor, Secure Communities. END OF SUMMARY.
