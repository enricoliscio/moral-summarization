SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to deport "criminal aliens", is failing to target its intended group. Instead, half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were for individuals with no criminal convictions, often arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations. Only one quarter of those targeted had committed serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. This raises concerns about the program's effectiveness and its impact on community policing, as undocumented immigrants may be deterred from reporting crimes for fear of being deported. The report's findings contradict ICE's claims that the program focuses on convicted criminals and individuals who threaten public safety and national security. Critics argue that the program is not keeping anyone secure and is instead perpetuating a humanitarian crisis.

END OF SUMMARY.
