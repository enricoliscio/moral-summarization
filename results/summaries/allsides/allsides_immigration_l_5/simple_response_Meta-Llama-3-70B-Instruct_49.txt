SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is failing to target its intended group. Instead, half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were individuals with past arrests but no convictions. Many were arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations or had their charges dropped. Only a quarter of those targeted had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. This raises concerns about the program's effectiveness and potential harm to immigrant communities. Critics argue that the program is not prioritizing public safety and national security, but rather targeting individuals with no criminal record. The report's findings also highlight the humanitarian crisis fueled by mass deportations and the need for a more nuanced approach to immigration enforcement.

END OF SUMMARY.
