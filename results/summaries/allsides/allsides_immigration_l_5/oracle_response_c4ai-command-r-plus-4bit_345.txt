SUMMARY: A program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, known as the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), is reportedly missing its target, according to a recent analysis. The program, which was designed to focus on "criminal aliens" convicted of serious offenses, has resulted in the detention and deportation of many immigrants with no criminal convictions. The analysis found that only a quarter of those detained had committed serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault, while the majority had been arrested for lesser violations such as drunk driving or traffic offenses. This indicates that ICE may be falling short of its stated goal to focus on convicted criminals and those who threaten public safety and national security. The program has also been criticized for potentially discouraging immigrants from reporting crimes, as they fear being picked up by authorities themselves. There are concerns that the PEP program may be little more than a name change from previous deportation policies, with ICE continuing to target undocumented immigrants regardless of their criminal history.
END OF SUMMARY.
