SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to deport "criminal aliens," is targeting individuals with no criminal convictions. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were for people with past arrests but no convictions. Many were arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations or had their charges dropped. Only one-quarter had committed serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. Despite claims of narrowing criteria, ICE is targeting people with no criminal record at a higher rate than before. This raises concerns about the program's effectiveness and potential harm to immigrant communities, who may be deterred from reporting crimes to the police for fear of deportation. The report's findings suggest that the PEP program may be failing to prioritize public safety and national security, and instead perpetuating a humanitarian crisis.

END OF SUMMARY.
