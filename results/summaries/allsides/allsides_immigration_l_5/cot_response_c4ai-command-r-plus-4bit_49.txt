SUMMARY:
A new report reveals that a program intended to prioritize the deportation of "criminal aliens", dubbed the "worst of the worst", is falling short of its mark. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which aims to expedite the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, has been found to target individuals with no criminal convictions or only minor offenses. According to the analysis, half of the so-called "holds" were placed on individuals with past arrests but no convictions, while just a quarter had committed serious crimes such as murder or sexual assault. The most common convictions were for drunk driving, miscellaneous assaults, and traffic offenses. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of the program and its impact on immigrant communities. Advocates argue that the program may deter immigrants from reporting crimes, as they fear being picked up by authorities themselves. The program has also been criticized for potentially compromising community policing needs and the safety of undocumented immigrants who are victims of crimes. Furthermore, the PEP program has been scrutinized for its similarities to its predecessor, Secure Communities, which contributed to a record number of deportations under the Obama administration. Despite claims of narrowing criteria, ICE continues to target individuals with no criminal record at a higher rate. The debate surrounding unauthorized immigration and the moral implications of deportation practices in the US continues, with advocates calling for more transparency and a reevaluation of enforcement priorities.
