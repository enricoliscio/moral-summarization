SUMMARY:
A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants were for those with no criminal convictions, with many arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations. Only one quarter had committed serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. The program claims to focus on "criminal aliens" convicted of felonies or multiple misdemeanors, but in reality, it targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. This approach has sparked concerns about creating a "humanitarian crisis" and undermining "sanctuary city" policies that protect undocumented immigrants who are "victims of crime" from being deported. The program's implementation has been criticized for being a mere "name change" that fails to prioritize "common-sense" approaches to immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
