SUMMARY: An analysis of the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which aims to prioritize the deportation of "criminal aliens," reveals that it is falling short of its target. Half of the so-called "holds" placed on individuals were based on arrests without criminal convictions, with many cases involving traffic violations or dropped charges. Only a quarter of the holds involved serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault. This indicates that ICE's claim of focusing on convicted criminals and threats to public safety and national security may not be fully realized in practice. The program has been criticized for potentially deterring immigrants from reporting crimes, and local law enforcement agencies have refused to honor some or all requests to hold immigrants in detention. Advocates question the effectiveness of PEP, suspecting it to be a mere renaming of the previous Secure Communities program. ICE's use of new detainer forms targeting recent entrants without convictions or security risks raises concerns about the true nature and impact of the program. END OF SUMMARY.
