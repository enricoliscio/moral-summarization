SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to deport "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Analysis of requests by federal officials found that half of the "holds" were placed on people who had been arrested but had no criminal conviction. Many were picked up during traffic violations or had their charges dropped, yet were still detained and deported. Only one quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. The most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses. Despite claims of narrowing criteria, ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. Immigration advocates argue that the PEP program is not significantly different from its predecessor and that it undermines community policing by deterring immigrants from reporting crimes.

END OF SUMMARY.
