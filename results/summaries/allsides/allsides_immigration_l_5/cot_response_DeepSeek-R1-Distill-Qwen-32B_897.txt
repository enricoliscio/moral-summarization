Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to identify the morally framed words first. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE, which is supposed to target "criminal aliens" for deportation. But it seems like many of the people being held under this program don't have criminal convictions. Instead, they were arrested but their charges were dropped, or they were picked up for minor things like traffic violations. The report from Syracuse University's TRAC shows that only a quarter of those held had serious offenses like murder or sexual assault, with the most common being drunk driving or assaults. ICE claims they're focusing on convicted criminals, but the data suggests they're targeting more people without criminal records than before.

Maria Sotomayor, an undocumented immigrant, points out that this approach discourages victims from reporting crimes because they might get detained. Many local law enforcement agencies refuse to cooperate with ICE, and some jurisdictions have become sanctuary cities. The article also mentions that the number of unauthorized immigrants has decreased, and Obama's record on deportations is high, but he also protected some groups through executive orders. Advocates suspect that PEP isn't much different from the previous program and that ICE is still detaining people without convictions, which they see as ineffective and harmful.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral connotation, either positive or negative. Let me go through the article again and pick out these words.

- "Holds" – implies detention, which has a negative connotation.
- "Expedite" – speeding up deportation, which could be seen as efficient but also harsh.
- "Criminal aliens" – labels people as criminals, negative framing.
- "Missing its target" – implies failure, negative.
- "Worst of the worst" – very negative, implying severe offenders.
- "Deportation" – can be seen as necessary but also harsh.
- "Arrested" – neutral, but in context, it's part of the negative process.
- "Charges dropped" – implies innocence or lack of conviction, positive in that sense.
- "Federal immigration detention" – negative, as it's a form of imprisonment.
- "Deportation proceedings" – negative, as it leads to removal.
- "Humanitarian crisis" – strongly negative, indicating suffering.
- "Convicted" – neutral but in context, it's about criminal history.
- "Murder" – very negative.
- "Sexual assault" – very negative.
- "Drunk driving" – negative, but less severe.
- "Assaults" – negative.
- "Simple traffic offenses" – less severe negative.
- "Target" – neutral but in context, it's about selecting people for detention.
- "Undocumented immigrants" – neutral but often framed negatively in debates.
- "Sanctuary city" – positive, as it's protective.
- "Victim" – negative, as it's someone who's been wronged.
- "Call the police" – neutral but in context, it's about seeking help.
- "Detained" – negative.
- "Unauthorized immigration" – neutral but often framed negatively.
- "Executive orders" – neutral but in context, it's about protection, which is positive.
- "Deportations" – negative.
- "Net unauthorized immigration" – neutral.
- "Strict border enforcement" – positive in terms of control but negative in terms of impact.
- "Joke" – negative, indicating the program is ineffective.

Wait, some of these might not be single words or might not carry a strong moral connotation. Let me refine this list to only include single words that are clearly morally framed.

- Holds
- Expedite
- Criminal
- Missing
- Worst
- Deportation
- Arrested
- Charges
- Federal
- Detention
- Deportation
- Humanitarian
- Convicted
- Murder
- Sexual
- Assault
- Drunk
- Driving
- Assaults
- Target
- Undocumented
- Sanctuary
- Victim
- Detained
- Unauthorized
- Executive
- Joke

Wait, some of these are just parts of phrases. Let me make sure each is a single word with moral framing.

Now, moving on to the summary. I need to condense the article, preserving the moral framing. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include as many of the morally framed words as possible.

I'll start by stating the issue: the PEP program is supposed to target criminal aliens but often detains those without convictions. Then mention the report's findings, Maria's concern about discouraging crime reporting, the sanctuary cities, ICE's claims versus the data, and the advocates' skepticism.

I need to make sure to include words like "criminal," "deportation," "detention," "humanitarian crisis," "victim," "sanctuary," "joke," etc.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows naturally while incorporating the moral framing words.

**Summary:**

The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE aims to deport "criminal aliens," but many detained lack convictions. A report reveals half of detentions involve arrests without convictions, often for minor offenses like traffic violations. This raises concerns about detaining innocent individuals and discouraging crime reporting among immigrants, as highlighted by Maria Sotomayor. Despite ICE's claims of targeting serious offenders, data shows more people without records are detained. Sanctuary cities resist ICE's requests, and advocates suspect PEP is similar to its predecessor, questioning its effectiveness. The program's impact on unauthorized immigration and public safety remains contentious, with critics calling it a "joke" due to its broad targeting. END OF SUMMARY.
