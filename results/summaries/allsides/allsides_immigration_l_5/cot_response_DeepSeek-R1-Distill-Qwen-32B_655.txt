Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me read through the text again.

The article talks about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) intended to deport 'criminal aliens.' The term 'criminal aliens' is a moral framing, implying they are bad. It mentions that many holds are on people with arrests but no convictions, which highlights the issue of innocent people being targeted. Words like 'expedite deportation,''missing its target,' 'worst of the worst,' 'deportation,' 'humanitarian crisis,' 'felonies,''misdemeanor offenses,' 'focus enforcement resources,' 'public safety,' 'national security,''sanctuary city,' 'victims of crime,' 'community policing,' 'unauthorized immigration,' 'deportations,' 'executive orders,' 'protect,''sue,' 'name change,' 'joke' all carry moral connotations.

Now, I need to write a concise summary using these terms. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but include the key points about the program's failure to target only serious criminals, the impact on innocent individuals, the humanitarian crisis, ICE's claims versus the reality, and the legal challenges. I should make sure to include the morally charged words to preserve the author's framing.

**SUMMARY:**
The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), aimed at deporting 'criminal aliens,' has failed to target only the most serious offenders. Many individuals detained under PEP have arrests but no convictions, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. Despite ICE's claims of focusing on public safety and national security, data shows a higher rate of targeting individuals with no criminal records. This has fueled a humanitarian crisis, particularly affecting immigrants who fear reporting crimes. Sanctuary cities and legal challenges highlight concerns that PEP may not differ significantly from its predecessor, with critics labeling it a 'name change' and a 'joke.' The program's impact on community trust and immigration enforcement remains contentious. END OF SUMMARY.
