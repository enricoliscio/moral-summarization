SUMMARY: A new report reveals that a program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is falling short of its target. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which was designed to focus on "criminal aliens" with felony or misdemeanor convictions, has resulted in the detention and deportation of many immigrants with no criminal convictions. An analysis of requests for local jails to hold immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law found that half of the holds were placed on individuals with no convictions, and only a quarter had committed serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault. The most common conviction was for drunk driving. This misalignment between the program's stated goals and its outcomes has led to criticism and lawsuits from immigration advocates, who argue that the program is not effectively prioritizing the deportation of "the worst of the worst". ICE has defended its efforts, stating that it is making strides to ensure a common-sense approach that focuses on convicted criminals and those who threaten public safety. However, the high rate of detention and deportation for immigrants with minor offenses or no convictions at all has raised concerns about the program's effectiveness and its impact on immigrant communities. END OF SUMMARY.
