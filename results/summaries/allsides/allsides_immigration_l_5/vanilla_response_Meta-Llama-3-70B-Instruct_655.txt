SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to deport "criminal aliens", is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were on individuals with past arrests but no convictions. Many were picked up for traffic violations or had charges dropped, but were still detained and faced deportation proceedings. Only one quarter of those targeted had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common convictions were for drunk driving, assaults, and traffic offenses. Despite claims of narrowing criteria, ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. Immigration advocates argue that the PEP program is not significantly different from its predecessor, Secure Communities, and that it may be falling short of its goals.

END OF SUMMARY.
