Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) and how it's not targeting the intended criminals but many without convictions. The moral issue here is that innocent people are being detained and deported, which affects community trust in law enforcement. I should highlight the misuse of the program, the impact on immigrants, and the criticism from advocates. I'll make sure to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points about the program's failure, the types of offenses, and the consequences on communities. Also, I should mention ICE's response and the ongoing legal challenges to show the broader implications.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the U.S. Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," is targeting individuals with no criminal convictions, often detaining those with only arrests or minor offenses like traffic violations. Despite ICE's claims of focusing on serious offenders, data shows that only a quarter of those detained had committed severe crimes, while many faced lesser charges or had their cases dismissed. Critics argue that this approach undermines community trust, as immigrants may avoid reporting crimes for fear of detention. The program has faced resistance from local agencies, with at least 377 refusing ICE requests. Advocates suspect PEP is merely a rebranded version of the previous Secure Communities program, continuing to harm vulnerable communities. END OF SUMMARY.
