SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program, intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were individuals with past arrests but no convictions. Some were picked up during traffic violations or had their charges dropped, yet still ended up in federal immigration detention and deportation proceedings. Only a quarter of those targeted had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. Instead, the most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses. This raises concerns about the program's focus on "criminal aliens" and its impact on community policing needs. Immigration advocates argue that the program is not keeping anyone secure and may be perpetuating a humanitarian crisis. The report's findings suggest that the program's implementation is falling short of its intended goals, fueling concerns about the agency's priorities and the humanitarian implications of its actions.
