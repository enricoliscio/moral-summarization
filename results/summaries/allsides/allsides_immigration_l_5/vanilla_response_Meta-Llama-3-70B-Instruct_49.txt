SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens," is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were on individuals with past arrests but no convictions. Many were arrested for minor offenses like traffic violations or had charges dropped. Only one quarter had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. The most common conviction was for drunk driving. Despite claims of narrowing criteria, ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. Critics argue that the program is not prioritizing public safety and national security, but rather fueling a humanitarian crisis. Immigration advocates have sued to obtain more details on how the PEP program differs from its predecessor, suspecting it may be just a name change.

END OF SUMMARY.
