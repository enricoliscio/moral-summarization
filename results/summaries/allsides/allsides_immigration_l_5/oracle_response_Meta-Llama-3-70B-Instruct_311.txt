SUMMARY:

A new report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens", is missing its target. Half of the "holds" placed on immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law were individuals with past arrests but no convictions. Many were picked up for traffic violations or had their charges dropped, yet still ended up in federal immigration detention and deportation proceedings. Only a quarter of those targeted had committed serious offenses like murder or sexual assault. The most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses. This raises concerns that the program is not focusing on "criminal aliens" as claimed, but rather on individuals who pose no threat to public safety and national security. The report's findings suggest that the program is fueling a humanitarian crisis and undermining trust in law enforcement, as immigrants may be reluctant to report crimes for fear of being detained themselves.
