SUMMARY: A program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, known as the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), has been found to be missing its target, according to a recent report. The analysis revealed that half of the so-called 'holds' placed on individuals were for those who had been arrested but had no criminal convictions, while only a quarter had committed serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault. This indicates that the program is not effectively focusing on 'criminal aliens', as intended. The program, started in 2008, has contributed to a record number of deportations, with Barack Obama deporting more people than any other president. However, immigration advocates have criticized the program, claiming that it targets people with no criminal record and falls short of ensuring community safety. They argue that the program creates a humanitarian crisis and deters immigrants from reporting crimes, as they fear they could be picked up and face deportation proceedings. The program's effectiveness and ethics are being questioned, with some suggesting that the recent name change to PEP is just a facade.
END OF SUMMARY.
