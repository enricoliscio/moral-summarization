Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about a program called the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) by ICE. It's supposed to target 'criminal aliens' for deportation, but the report says it's not working as intended. 

Hmm, the key points are that half of the holds were on people without convictions, just arrests. Some were picked up for traffic violations or had charges dropped. The most serious offenses were only a quarter of the cases, mostly drunk driving and assaults. ICE claims they've narrowed their criteria, but data shows they're targeting people without criminal records more now. 

There's also mention of sanctuary cities and how the program affects community trust. Maria Sotomayor's point about immigrants not calling police because of detainers is important. Plus, advocates suspect PEP is just a rebranded version of Secure Communities, which led to many deportations under Obama. 

I should include the statistics, the issues with the program's effectiveness, ICE's response, and the broader implications like the humanitarian crisis and sanctuary cities. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it: start with the program's purpose, the report's findings, ICE's response, examples of issues, and the advocates' concerns. That should cover all the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A report reveals that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), designed to deport "criminal aliens," often targets individuals without criminal convictions. Half of the immigration holds were placed on people arrested but not convicted, including those with dropped charges or minor offenses like traffic violations. Only a quarter had serious convictions like murder or sexual assault. ICE claims PEP focuses on felons, but data shows more non-criminal immigrants are being targeted. Advocates argue the program lacks transparency and may harm community trust, as immigrants fear detention for reporting crimes. Sanctuary cities have resisted PEP, and advocates suspect it is similar to the previous Secure Communities program, which led to mass deportations. The report highlights concerns over PEP's effectiveness and humanitarian impact. END OF SUMMARY.
