SUMMARY: A program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records is missing its target, according to a recent report. The Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which was supposed to focus on deporting "criminal aliens" with serious convictions, has instead resulted in the detention and deportation of many immigrants with no criminal record or only minor offenses. This is despite claims by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they have narrowed their criteria and are focusing on convicted criminals and those who threaten public safety. The report found that only a quarter of those detained had committed serious offenses, while the rest had been arrested for minor infractions or had their charges dropped. This has fueled concerns that the program is contributing to a humanitarian crisis and is not keeping communities secure. Immigrants may be less likely to report crimes if they fear being picked up by ICE. Local law enforcement agencies have also refused to honor requests to hold immigrants in detention, highlighting the ineffectiveness and potential harm of the PEP program. This summary highlights the moral implications of the program's failure to prioritize truly criminal aliens and the potential harm it is causing to immigrant communities.
END OF SUMMARY.
