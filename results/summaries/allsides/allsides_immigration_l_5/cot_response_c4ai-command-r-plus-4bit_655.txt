SUMMARY: An analysis of the Priority Enforcement Program, intended to expedite the deportation of "criminal aliens", reveals that many of those targeted have no criminal convictions. While the program is meant to prioritize the "worst of the worst", half of those detained had only been arrested, with charges dropped or minor offenses such as drunk driving and traffic violations. This suggests that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is falling short of its stated goal to focus on convicted criminals and those threatening public safety and national security. The program has also been criticized for potentially discouraging undocumented immigrants from reporting crimes for fear of being detained themselves. The PEP program has replaced the Secure Communities initiative, which contributed to a record number of deportations under Barack Obama. However, immigration advocates suspect that PEP may be little more than a name change, as ICE continues to target those with no criminal record and has introduced new detainer forms that seem to contradict its stated priorities. The debate around these enforcement programs highlights the moral concerns surrounding the treatment of undocumented immigrants, with critics arguing that the programs create a humanitarian crisis and fail to prioritize community policing needs.
