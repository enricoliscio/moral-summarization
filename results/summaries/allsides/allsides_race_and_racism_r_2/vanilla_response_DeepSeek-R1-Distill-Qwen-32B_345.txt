Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the main points.

First, Barr established the task force to target violent extremists of all kinds. He mentioned in a memo that these groups are causing anarchy and destruction. The memo was shared by the DOJ spokesperson. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent such violence. 

Then, the article talks about the protests after George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson. Barr pointed out the threats to public safety and the rule of law, including attacks on police and destruction of property.

There's also a mention of the situation in Seattle with the autonomous zone, where there were violent incidents and armed activists. Property owners filed a lawsuit against the city. Barr noted that some extremists are supported by foreign entities trying to cause chaos.

The task force will help local law enforcement by providing training and working with the FBI to gather information. Plus, President Trump signed an executive order to protect monuments, which he linked to combating violence.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the key elements: Barr's task force, its goals, the context of recent protests, examples of violence, foreign influences, and the support for law enforcement. Also, mention Trump's executive order as it's related.

Let me structure it: Start with Barr creating the task force, mention the memo, the goals, the context of the protests, examples of violence, the Seattle situation, foreign support, the task force's support for law enforcement, and Trump's order. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point. Keep it brief but informative. Also, ensure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown.

Alright, putting it all together now.
