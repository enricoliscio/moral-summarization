SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force aimed at stopping violent anti-government extremists. Barr's announcement came in response to recent protests that, while largely peaceful, have at times descended into looting, arson, and violence. The task force will investigate and prosecute perpetrators of violence, prevent extremist violence before it happens, and work to eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that extremist groups, including those who support "Bugaloo" and self-identify as Antifa, pose a continuing threat to law and order. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to develop information about violent extremists. Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump's executive order protecting American monuments and statues from destruction, with both moves seeking to address recent unrest and uphold law and order.
