SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress, but are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr notes that recent weeks have witnessed significant threats to the rule of law, with anti-government extremists engaged in indefensible acts of violence, including attacks on police officers and government officials, destruction of public and private property, and threats to innocent bystanders. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and will work closely with the FBI to develop detailed information about violent anti-government extremist individuals, networks, and movements. The goal is to prevent chaos and disorder, and to protect the core constitutional values of a democratic society governed by law.
