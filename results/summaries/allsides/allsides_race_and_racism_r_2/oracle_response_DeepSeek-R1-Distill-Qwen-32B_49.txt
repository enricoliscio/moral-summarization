Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully. 

The article is about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to target violent anti-government extremists. He mentions the protests following George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson. Barr uses strong moral terms like "anarchy," "destruction," and "coercion" to describe the extremists. 

I should identify all the morally framed words the author used and make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. Words like "pretend," "freedom," "progress," "anarchy," etc., are important to highlight the moral stance. 

The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent violence, so I'll include those actions. I also need to mention the consequences, like the threat to public safety and the rule of law. 

I should structure the summary to first introduce Barr's initiative, then describe the context of the protests, the specific violent acts, and the measures the task force will take. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically.

Let me make sure to include terms like "violent acts," "protesters," "extremists," and the actions taken by the DOJ. I'll also mention the broader implications, such as foreign interference and the protection of monuments, as Barr and Trump are connected in their efforts.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the moral framing without adding any personal opinions, just reflecting the article's perspective.

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions," describing them as forces of "anarchy, destruction, and coercion." The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent violent acts, including looting, arson, and attacks on law enforcement, which have marred some protests following George Floyd's death. Barr emphasized the threat to public safety and the rule of law, noting that extremists, including those linked to "Bugaloo" and Antifa, seek to deny constitutional rights and resort to illegal methods. The initiative also targets foreign entities sowing chaos. The task force will assist local law enforcement and share intelligence to counter these threats. Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump signing an executive order to protect monuments and combat criminal violence, highlighting the administration's focus on restoring order and combating lawlessness.
