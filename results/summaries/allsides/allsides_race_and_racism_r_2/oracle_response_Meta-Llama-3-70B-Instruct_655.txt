SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress, but are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Recent weeks have witnessed significant threats to the rule of law, with peaceful demonstrations descending into scenes of looting, arson, and violence. Extremist groups targeted by the initiative seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. The DOJ has obtained evidence suggesting that some extremists intend to sow more chaos, and may be supported by foreign entities seeking to sow chaos and disorder. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to develop detailed information about violent anti-government extremist individuals, networks, and movements.
