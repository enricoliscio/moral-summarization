SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced the creation of a task force to address the threat posed by violent anti-government extremists of various ideologies, including those who support "Bugaloo" and self-identify as Antifa. Barr's memo to department heads and U.S. attorneys emphasized the need to uphold the rule of law and protect constitutional values in the face of recent acts of violence, intimidation, and destruction during otherwise peaceful protests. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute perpetrators, prevent future extremist violence, and eliminate it as a public safety threat. Barr noted that these extremists seek to deny the constitutional rights of others and that their methods are indefensible and chaotic. The initiative will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to gather and share information on violent anti-government individuals and networks. This announcement comes as President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments and memorials from destruction, emphasizing the need to uphold law and order in the face of recent criminal violence and extremist threats.
