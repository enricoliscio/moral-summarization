Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The article is about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to address violent anti-government extremists. 

I notice that the author uses several morally charged words, like "pretend," "anarchy," "destruction," "coercion," and "violent." My goal is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without losing the essence of the article. 

I'll start by identifying the main sections. Barr's memo outlines the task force's goals: investigating and prosecuting violent acts, preventing extremism, and eliminating threats. The article mentions the protests after George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson. Barr points out the threats to public safety and the rule of law, including attacks on police and property damage.

The article also touches on the situation in Seattle with the autonomous zone, where violence and illegal activities occurred. Barr links some extremists to foreign entities trying to create chaos. The task force will help local law enforcement and work with the FBI to gather information. Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order to protect monuments, emphasizing the fight against lawlessness.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, using the morally framed words. I'll structure it to highlight Barr's actions, the context of the protests, the violent incidents, and the broader implications of the task force. I should ensure the summary flows logically and stays within 200 words.

I'll make sure to include terms like "violent anti-government extremists," "pretend," "freedom," "anarchy," "destruction," "coercion," and others. I'll also mention the protests, the violent acts, and the task force's role in combating these threats. Finally, I'll tie in Trump's executive order to show the administration's stance on protecting national symbols and combating violence.

Putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that captures the moral framing while being clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions," targeting groups that "pretend" to advocate for "freedom" and "progress" but engage in "anarchy," "destruction," and "coercion." Barr emphasized that these extremists threaten the "rule of law" and public safety, citing recent violent protests, including "looting," "arson," and "attacks" on police and property. The task force aims to "investigate" and "prosecute" those involved, "prevent" future violence, and "eliminate" these threats. Barr also warned of "chaos" and "disorder" caused by groups like "Bugaloo" and "Antifa," some of which may be supported by "foreign entities." The task force will assist local law enforcement and collaborate with the FBI to gather intelligence. Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump signing an executive order to protect American monuments from "criminal violence," emphasizing the need to combat "lawlessness" and "violent acts" against the country. END OF SUMMARY.
