SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force to combat violent anti-government extremists of all ideological backgrounds. In a memo to department heads and U.S. attorneys, Barr noted recent acts of violence, destruction of property, and threats to public safety amid otherwise peaceful protests following the death of George Floyd. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of extremist violence, prevent future incidents, and eliminate the threat posed by these extremist groups. Barr identified various extremist ideologies, including "Bugaloo" and Antifa supporters, as targets of the initiative. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and collaborate with the FBI to gather and share intelligence on violent extremists. Barr's announcement coincides with President Trump's executive order to protect American monuments and statues from destruction, emphasizing harsh penalties for lawbreakers.
