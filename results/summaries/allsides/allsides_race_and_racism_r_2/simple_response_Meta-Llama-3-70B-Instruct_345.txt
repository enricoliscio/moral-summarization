SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in acts of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. Despite largely peaceful protests following George Floyd's death, some demonstrations have turned violent, with attacks on police, destruction of property, and threats to innocent bystanders. Barr notes that these extremists, who profess a message of freedom and progress, are in fact forces of chaos and disorder. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. The initiative will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to develop information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks. The move comes as President Trump signs an executive order protecting American monuments and statues from destruction, with long prison terms for those who engage in such lawless acts.

END OF SUMMARY.
