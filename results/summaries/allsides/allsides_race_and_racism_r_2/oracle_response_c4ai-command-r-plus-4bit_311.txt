SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force to stop "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions." Barr's announcement comes in response to recent protests that have largely been peaceful but have at times descended into scenes of looting, arson, and violence. Barr noted in a memo that "some pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress," but are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of violence, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr said that extremist groups targeted by the initiative deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to develop information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks. Barr's announcement came on the same day President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments, memorials, and statues from destruction, promising long prison terms for lawless acts.
