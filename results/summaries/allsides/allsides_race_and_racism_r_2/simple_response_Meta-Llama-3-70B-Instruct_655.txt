SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in destructive and coercive acts under the guise of promoting freedom and progress. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately eliminate violent extremism that threatens public safety and the rule of law. Barr condemned the violent acts that have marred otherwise peaceful protests, including attacks on police officers, destruction of property, and threats to innocent bystanders. He noted that extremist groups, including those associated with Antifa and the "Bugaloo," seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to gather intelligence on extremist individuals, networks, and movements. The announcement comes as President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments, memorials, and statues from destruction.
