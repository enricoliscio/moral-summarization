Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author used. The user also wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. He mentions in a memo that these extremists are forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. He talks about violent acts, protests, looting, arson, violence, threats, destruction of property, attacks on police, and undermining public safety. There's also mention of an autonomous zone in Seattle with acts of violence, armed activists, extorting businesses, and a federal lawsuit. Barr notes that these groups deny constitutional rights and are against democratic values. He also mentions foreign entities trying to sow chaos.

So, for the first step, I need to list all the single words that carry moral connotations. Let me go through the article again and pick them out:

- Violent
- Extremists
- Anarchy
- Destruction
- Coercion
- Violence
- Looting
- Arson
- Threats
- Destruction (again)
- Property
- Attacks
- Undermine
- Chaos
- Disorder
- Extorting
- Depriving
- Rights
- Lawlessness
- Criminal
- Lawless

I think those are the key morally framed words. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise and under 200 words. I should structure it to highlight Barr's actions and the moral issues he's addressing.

I'll start by introducing Barr and the task force. Then mention the memo's points about the extremists' actions, the specific violent incidents, and the broader implications like foreign interference. Finally, tie in Trump's executive order to show a coordinated effort against these threats.

Let me make sure I include all the key points and the moral framing words without making it too lengthy. I'll also ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point to show the context and the seriousness of the situation.

**SUMMARY:**

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions," describing them as forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those committing violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and eliminate threats to public safety and the rule of law. Barr emphasized the recent surge in violent protests, including looting, arson, and attacks on police, which have undermined public order. He also highlighted the presence of armed activists in Seattle's autonomous zone, where acts of violence and extortion have occurred. Barr noted that some extremists, including those supporting "Bugaloo" or Antifa, may be supported by foreign entities seeking to sow chaos. The task force will train local law enforcement and collaborate with the FBI to gather intelligence on these groups. Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump signing an executive order to protect American monuments from destruction, calling for long prison terms for those committing lawless acts.
