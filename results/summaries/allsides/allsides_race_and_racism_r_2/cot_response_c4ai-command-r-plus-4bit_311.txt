SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced the creation of a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions." Barr's announcement came amid ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd, which have seen instances of *violence*, *looting*, *arson*, and *attacks* on police and government officials. Barr's memo condemned these acts as *indefensible*, stating that they threaten *public order* and *intolerate* the rule of *law*. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of *violence*, prevent extremist *violence*, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to *public safety* and the rule of *law*. Barr noted that extremist groups, including those who support "Bugaloo" and self-identify as Antifa, pose continuing threats of *lawlessness* and *disorder*. The initiative will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to gather information on violent *anti-government extremists*. Barr's announcement came as President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments and combatting *criminal violence*, emphasizing the need for "long prison terms" for those who engage in such acts.
END OF SUMMARY.
