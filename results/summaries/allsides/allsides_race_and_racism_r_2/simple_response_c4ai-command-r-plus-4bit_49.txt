SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force aimed at stopping violent anti-government extremists. In a memo to department heads and U.S. attorneys, Barr expressed concern over recent threats to the rule of law, including attacks on police and government officials, destruction of property, and intimidation of bystanders. Barr noted that while peaceful protests are protected by the First Amendment, there have been instances of extremist violence and lawlessness. The task force will focus on investigating and prosecuting perpetrators, preventing future extremist violence, and restoring public safety and the rule of law. Barr specifically mentioned the "Bugaloo," Antifa, and other extremist groups as targets of the initiative, stating that they oppose core constitutional values and seek to deny rights to others through illegal means. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work with the FBI to gather and share information on extremist individuals and networks. Barr's announcement comes as President Trump takes steps to protect American monuments and statues from destruction, emphasizing the need for strong law enforcement to uphold public order. END OF SUMMARY.
