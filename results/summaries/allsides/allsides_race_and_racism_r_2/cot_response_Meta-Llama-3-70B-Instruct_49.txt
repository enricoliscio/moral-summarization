SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. These extremists, who pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress, are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that recent weeks have witnessed significant threats to the rule of law, with anti-government extremists engaging in indefensible acts of violence, including attacks on police officers and destruction of public and private property. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to develop detailed information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks.
