SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress but are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Recent protests, although largely peaceful, have descended into scenes of looting, arson, and violence, with attacks on police officers and government officials, destruction of public and private property, and threats to innocent bystanders. Barr noted that extremist groups targeted by the initiative seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to methods that are illegal, posing a threat to the core constitutional values of a democratic society governed by law. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to develop detailed information about violent anti-government extremist individuals, networks, and movements.
