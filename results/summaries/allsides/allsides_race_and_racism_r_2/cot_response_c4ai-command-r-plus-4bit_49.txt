SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. Barr's memo to department heads and U.S. attorneys denounces "forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion." The task force aims to investigate and prosecute violent actors, prevent extremist violence, and eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr's announcement comes amid peaceful protests against police brutality, which have at times been marred by looting, arson, and attacks on police and government officials. Barr notes the intimidation and destruction in Seattle's so-called "autonomous zone," where armed activists have extorted businesses and deprived residents of their rights. The task force will target extremist groups that deny constitutional rights and resort to illegal methods, opposing the core constitutional values of a democratic society governed by law. Barr warns of information suggesting that anti-government extremists intend to sow chaos and undercut public order, with some potentially supported by foreign entities seeking disorder. The initiative will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work with the FBI to share information on violent extremists. President Trump has also signed an executive order protecting American monuments and statues, promising long prison terms for criminal acts of destruction.
