SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to stop "violent anti-government extremists" and restore public order. Barr's memo decries recent acts of violence, looting, arson, and destruction of property, which he attributes to extremist groups with varying ideologies but a shared opposition to democratic values. These extremists, Barr argues, seek to deny constitutional rights and resort to illegal methods, including coercion and threats. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately eliminate this threat to public safety and the rule of law. It will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work with the FBI to gather and share information on violent extremists. Barr's announcement comes amidst ongoing peaceful protests against racial injustice, which have at times been marred by violent and destructive acts. The presence of armed activists, ID checks, and extortion within Seattle's "autonomous zone" is cited as an example of the lawlessness and threats to innocent bystanders that the task force aims to address. Barr emphasizes the importance of protecting democratic values and constitutional rights while also condemning those who seek to sow chaos and disorder. Barr's initiative underscores the moral imperative to uphold the rule of law and protect innocent citizens from threatening and violent extremist activities. END OF SUMMARY.
