Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Barr established a task force to investigate and prosecute violent acts, prevent extremism, and eliminate threats. He mentions the protests after George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson. He criticizes those who pretend to support freedom and progress but actually cause anarchy and destruction. 

I need to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Words like "pretend," "freedom," "progress," "anarchy," "destruction," "coercion," "violent," "prevent," "prosecute," "threat," "looting," "arson," "attacks," "shooting," "extorting," "tolerance," "complicit," "deny," "chaos," "pose," "disorder," "beat," "arrest," "executive order," "combatting," "prison," and "acts" are important. 

I should structure the summary to highlight Barr's actions, the context of the protests, the negative behaviors he's targeting, and the methods the task force will use. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. 

I'll start by introducing Barr and the task force, then mention the protests and the violence that occurred. I'll include the moral terms to show the framing, like how some groups pretend to support freedom but cause destruction. Then, I'll explain the task force's goals and methods, and note Barr's concern about foreign influence. Finally, I'll add the executive order Trump signed, tying it to the broader context of protecting monuments and combating violence.

Let me make sure I include all the key points without making it too long. I'll check that each sentence adds value and uses the moral words appropriately. I need to ensure the summary flows logically, from Barr's announcement to the context, the task force's mission, and the broader implications.

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions," aiming to investigate, prosecute, and prevent acts of violence. Barr criticized groups that "pretend" to support "freedom" and "progress" but instead spread "anarchy," "destruction," and "coercion." He highlighted recent protests, many peaceful, but some marked by "looting," "arson," and "violence," including attacks on police and property. Barr emphasized the threat of extremists seeking to "deny" constitutional rights and "resort" to illegal methods, warning of potential "chaos" and "disorder." The task force will train local law enforcement, share intelligence with agencies, and "arrest" perpetrators. Barr also noted concerns about foreign influence in sowing "chaos." Meanwhile, President Trump signed an executive order to "protect" American monuments and "combat" violent acts, signaling a broader effort to "combat" lawlessness and "preserve" public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
