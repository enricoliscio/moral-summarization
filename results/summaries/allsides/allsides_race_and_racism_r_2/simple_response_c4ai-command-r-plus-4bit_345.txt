SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists and restore law and order. Barr's memo to department heads and U.S. attorneys condemns acts of violence, destruction, and coercion carried out by extremists under the guise of freedom and progress. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent extremist violence, ensuring the safety and upholding the rule of law. Barr highlights recent threats to public order, including attacks on police, destruction of property, and the establishment of an "autonomous zone" in Seattle, which has been marred by violence and unlawful activities. He emphasizes the unity among extremists in their opposition to democratic values and their intent to deny constitutional rights to others. The initiative will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to gather information and share it with relevant authorities. Barr's announcement aligns with President Trump's executive order protecting American monuments and statues and sends a clear message against lawlessness and chaos.
