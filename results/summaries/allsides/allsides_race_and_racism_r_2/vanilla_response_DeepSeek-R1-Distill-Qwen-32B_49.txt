Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force. Let me read through the article first. 

The article starts by mentioning Barr speaking at a roundtable, then moves on to his memo about the task force aimed at stopping violent anti-government extremists. He mentions that some groups pretend to support freedom but are actually causing anarchy. The task force's goals are to investigate, prosecute, prevent, and eliminate these threats. 

Then it talks about the protests after George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson. Barr points out specific violent acts, like attacks on police and destruction of property. There's a mention of the Seattle autonomous zone, which had some violent incidents and armed patrols. 

Barr also notes that some extremists are supported by foreign entities and mentions the task force will help local law enforcement with training and sharing info with the FBI. The summary needs to include that Barr's announcement coincided with Trump signing an executive order to protect monuments. 

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to condense the key points: task force creation, its goals, examples of violence during protests, Seattle's autonomous zone issues, foreign influence, and the executive order. I'll make sure to mention the main actors and the context of recent protests. 

Let me structure it: start with Barr creating the task force, its purpose, mention the recent protests and the violence, the specific examples like Seattle, the threat from foreign entities, and the executive order. Keep it concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary details.
