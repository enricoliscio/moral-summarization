SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in "indefensible acts of violence" and seek to deny "constitutional rights" to others. These "forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion" have been involved in "looting, arson, and violence" during protests, and have targeted police officers and government officials. The task force aims to "ultimately eliminate" these threats to public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that while protests have been largely "peaceful", some have descended into "scenes of lawlessness" and "chaos". The initiative will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to develop information about these "violent anti-government extremist individuals, networks, and movements".
