SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force aimed at stopping "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions." In a memo to department heads and U.S. attorneys, Barr expressed concern over recent "indefensible acts of violence" and "significant threats to the rule of law." He noted that while many protests have been peaceful, there have been instances of violence, looting, and arson. Barr specifically mentioned attacks on police officers, destruction of property, and the establishment of an "autonomous zone" in Seattle, which has seen its own share of violent incidents. The task force will focus on investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of violence, preventing future extremist violence, and eliminating it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr highlighted the illegal and unconstitutional nature of extremist groups, stating that they "oppose the core constitutional values of a democratic society governed by law." The initiative comes amid concerns over threats to American monuments, memorials, and statues, with President Trump signing an executive order to protect them. Barr's memo also mentioned the possibility of foreign entities supporting extremists seeking to sow chaos and lawlessness. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to gather and share information on violent anti-government extremists.
