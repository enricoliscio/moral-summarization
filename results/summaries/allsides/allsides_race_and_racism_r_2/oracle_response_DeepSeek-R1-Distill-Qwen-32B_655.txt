Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Attorney General William Barr created a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. He mentioned that some groups pretend to support freedom and progress but are actually causing anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute these groups, prevent violence, and eliminate the threat they pose. 

The article also talks about the protests following George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting, arson, and attacks on police. Barr emphasized that these violent acts are a threat to public safety and the rule of law. He also mentioned that some extremists are supported by foreign entities trying to create chaos.

I need to make sure to include words like "pretend," "freedom," "progress," "anarchy," "destruction," "coercion," "investigate," "prosecute," "violent," "prevent," "violence," "threat," "death," "kneeling," "protests," "descended," "looting," "arson," "attacks," "shooting," "patrolling," "checking," "extorting," "tolerance," "complicit," "deny," "resort," "profess," "united," "chaos," "pose," "undercut," "disorder," "beat," "arrest," "signing," "combatting," "prison," and "acts."

I should structure the summary to highlight Barr's actions and the moral implications he's emphasizing. I'll start by stating the creation of the task force, then mention the groups they're targeting and the moral framing words. I'll include the context of the protests, the violence that occurred, and Barr's concerns about foreign influence. Finally, I'll note the executive order signed by Trump to protect monuments.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure all key points and moral terms are included. I'll avoid any markdown and just use plain text for the summary.

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions," describing them as forces of "anarchy, destruction, and coercion." Barr emphasized that some groups "pretend" to advocate for "freedom" and "progress" but engage in "indefensible acts of violence," including "looting," "arson," and "attacks" on law enforcement. The task force aims to "investigate," "prosecute," and "prevent" such violence, targeting those who "deny" constitutional rights and "resort" to illegal methods. Barr noted that some extremists, including those associated with "Bugaloo" and "Antifa," may be supported by "foreign entities" seeking to create "chaos." The announcement came as President Trump signed an executive order to "combat" violence against American monuments, vowing "long prison terms" for those involved. The task force will also "train" local law enforcement and "share" intelligence to counter threats to "public safety" and the "rule of law." END OF SUMMARY.
