SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions." The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that while recent protests have been largely peaceful, some have descended into scenes of looting, arson, and violence. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to gather information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks. Barr stated that extremist groups targeted by the initiative seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. The announcement came on the same day President Donald Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments, memorials, and statues from being destroyed.
