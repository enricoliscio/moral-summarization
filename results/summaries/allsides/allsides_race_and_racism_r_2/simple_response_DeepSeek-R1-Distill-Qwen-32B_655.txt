Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the tone.

The article starts by introducing Barr and his task force, which aims to halt violent anti-government extremists. He mentions that some of these groups pretend to support freedom and progress but are actually causing anarchy. The context is the protests following George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting, arson, and attacks on police.

Barr's memo highlights the threats to the rule of law and the violent acts committed by some extremists. He specifically mentions groups like Antifa and Bugaloo, and even suggests foreign entities are involved in sowing chaos. The task force's goals are to investigate and prosecute, prevent violence, and eliminate the threat. They'll also train local law enforcement and work with the FBI to share information.

The article also notes that the announcement coincided with Trump signing an executive order to protect monuments, emphasizing the government's stance against violence and lawlessness.

Now, I need to capture all these elements in a concise summary, keeping the moral framing. The original text presents Barr's perspective as the government taking necessary action against violent groups, framing them as threats to the rule of law and democracy. I should maintain that perspective, highlighting the government's response to these threats.

I should structure the summary to first mention the task force's creation, its purpose, the context of the protests, the violent acts, and the government's response. Also, include the mention of foreign involvement and the executive order to show a comprehensive approach.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key points without losing the moral framing. I'll start with the task force, its goals, the context of the protests, the specific groups targeted, the methods of the task force, and the related executive order.

Let me draft this step by step, making sure each part flows logically and maintains the original's tone and emphasis on the threat to the rule of law and the government's proactive measures.
