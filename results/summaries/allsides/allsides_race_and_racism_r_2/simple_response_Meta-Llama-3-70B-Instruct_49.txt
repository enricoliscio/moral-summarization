SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in acts of anarchy, destruction, and coercion under the guise of promoting freedom and progress. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent extremist violence, ultimately eliminating it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr condemned the violent acts that have marred peaceful protests, including attacks on police officers, destruction of property, and threats to innocent bystanders. He noted that extremist groups, including those who identify as Antifa and others, seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work with the FBI to gather information on violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks.
