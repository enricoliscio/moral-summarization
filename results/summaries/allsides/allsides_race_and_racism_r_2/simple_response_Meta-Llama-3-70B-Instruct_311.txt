SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in destructive and coercive acts under the guise of promoting freedom and progress. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent extremist violence, ultimately eliminating it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr condemned the violent acts that have marred otherwise peaceful protests, including attacks on police officers, destruction of property, and threats to innocent bystanders. He noted that these extremists seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods, united in their opposition to democratic values. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to gather information on extremist individuals, networks, and movements. This effort is crucial in preserving the rule of law and protecting American monuments, memorials, and statues from destruction.
