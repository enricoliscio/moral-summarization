Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

So, Barr established a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. He mentioned in a memo that these extremists are causing anarchy and destruction. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute them, prevent violence, and eliminate the threat. 

The article also talks about the protests after George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson. Barr pointed out specific violent acts like attacks on police, destruction of property, and the autonomous zone in Seattle. There were armed groups there, and some property owners sued the city.

Barr noted that these extremists have various ideologies but oppose constitutional values. They might be supported by foreign entities. The task force will help local law enforcement and work with the FBI to gather info. Also, Trump signed an executive order to protect monuments, which seems related to the broader issue of violence against public property.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: task force creation, its goals, examples of violence, the autonomous zone, foreign support, and the executive order. Make sure it's concise and flows well.
