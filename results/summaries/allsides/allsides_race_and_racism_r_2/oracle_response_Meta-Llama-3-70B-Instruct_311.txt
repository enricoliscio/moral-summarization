SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who "pretend" to profess a message of "freedom" and "progress" but are in fact forces of "anarchy", "destruction", and "coercion". The task force aims to "investigate" and "prosecute" those who commit violent acts, "prevent" extremist violence, and ultimately "eliminate" it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that recent weeks have seen "significant threats to the rule of law", with "anti-government extremists" engaged in "indefensible acts of violence", including attacks on police officers, destruction of property, and threats to innocent bystanders. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to "arrest" perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to develop information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks. The goal is to "combat" chaos and disorder, and bring those who "resort" to violent acts to justice, with "long prison terms" for those who engage in lawless acts.
