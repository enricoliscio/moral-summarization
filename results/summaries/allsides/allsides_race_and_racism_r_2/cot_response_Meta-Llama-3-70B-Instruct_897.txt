SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in "indefensible acts of violence" and seek to undermine the "rule of law" and "constitutional values" of a democratic society. These extremists, who claim to profess "freedom and progress," are in fact forces of "anarchy, destruction, and coercion." The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and "ultimately eliminate" these threats to public safety and the rule of law. The initiative comes amid reports of "lawlessness" and "chaos" in cities like Seattle, where "anti-government extremists" have established an "autonomous zone" and engaged in violent acts, including a recent shooting. The DOJ has obtained evidence that some extremists intend to "sow more chaos" and may be supported by "foreign entities seeking to sow chaos and disorder."
