SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions." The task force aims to investigate and prosecute individuals who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that while protests have been largely peaceful, some have descended into scenes of looting, arson, and violence. He cited attacks on police officers, destruction of property, and threats to innocent bystanders. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work with the FBI to develop information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks. Barr's announcement came on the same day President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments, memorials, and statues from being destroyed.
