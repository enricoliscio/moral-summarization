Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. He mentions that these extremists are causing violence, looting, arson, and other destructive acts, especially during the protests following George Floyd's death. Barr wants to investigate and prosecute these individuals, prevent violence, and eliminate the threat to public safety and the rule of law. 

He also notes that while some protests are peaceful, there have been instances of violence, like attacks on police, destruction of property, and even an autonomous zone in Seattle where violence occurred. Barr's task force will help local law enforcement by providing training and resources, and they'll work with the FBI to gather information on these groups. Additionally, Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump signing an executive order to protect monuments and combat violence, emphasizing long prison terms for those involved in such acts.

Now, I need to make sure I include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "pretend," "freedom," "progress," "anarchy," "destruction," "coercion," "investigate," "prosecute," "violent," "prevent," "violence," "threat," "death," "kneeling," "protests," "descended," "looting," "arson," "threats," "protected," "engaged," "attacks," "shooting," "patrolling," "checking," "extorting," "tolerance," "complicit," "depriving," "deny," "resort," "profess," "united," "chaos," "pose," "undercut," "tried," "disorder," "beat," "arrest," "signing," "combatting," "prison," "acts."

I should structure the summary to include the key points: Barr's task force, the nature of the extremists, the violent acts during protests, the purpose of the task force, and the executive order. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while incorporating the moral language.

Let me start drafting the summary. I'll mention Barr creating the task force, the target being violent anti-government extremists, their actions like looting and arson. Then, note the purpose: investigate, prosecute, prevent violence, eliminate threat. Mention the protests, the violence, the autonomous zone in Seattle, the lawsuit, and the task force's support to law enforcement. Finally, include the executive order and Trump's emphasis on prison terms.

I should ensure that the moral words are integrated naturally without forcing them. For example, using "pretend to profess freedom" and "forces of anarchy." Also, include terms like "deny constitutional rights," "pose continuing threats," and "foreign entities seeking chaos."

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but thorough. I'll make sure each sentence includes the necessary moral framing without being redundant.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral language is preserved effectively. I'll also make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat violent anti-government extremists, targeting groups that "pretend to profess freedom and progress" but engage in "anarchy, destruction, and coercion." The task force aims to "investigate and prosecute" those committing violent acts, "prevent" extremism, and "eliminate" threats to public safety. Protests following George Floyd's death have seen "peaceful demonstrations" alongside "looting, arson, and violence," including attacks on police and destruction of property. An autonomous zone in Seattle has faced "acts of violence" and "extortion," prompting a federal lawsuit. Barr emphasized that extremists "deny constitutional rights" and "resort to illegal methods," posing "continuing threats" with potential foreign support. The task force will aid law enforcement and share intelligence. Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump signing an executive order to protect monuments, calling for "long prison terms" for those committing "lawless acts." END OF SUMMARY.
