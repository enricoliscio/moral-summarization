SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists and restore public safety and the rule of law. In a memo, Barr noted that while recent protests have been largely peaceful, they have at times descended into scenes of looting, arson, and violence, with anti-government extremists pretending to profess a message of freedom and progress while engaging in acts of destruction and coercion. Barr identified several extremist groups, including those who support "Bugaloo" and self-identify as Antifa, as posing a continuing threat to law and order. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of violence, prevent extremist violence before it happens, and provide training and resources to local law enforcement. Barr's announcement comes as President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments and combatting criminal violence, emphasizing the need for long prison terms for lawless acts. This unified effort underscores the commitment to protecting constitutional rights and ensuring that those who engage in violent and destructive acts are brought to justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
