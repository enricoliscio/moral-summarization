Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified a two-step process: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a concise summary using those words.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "violent," "extremists," "anarchy," "destruction," "coercion," "chaos," "lawlessness," "anti-government," "deprived," "sow," "disorder," "executive order," "protecting," "criminal," "prison," "lawless," "great," and "country" stand out as they convey moral judgments or values.

For the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, making sure to include as many of these moral terms as possible. The main points are Barr's task force targeting violent anti-government extremists, the context of recent protests, the DOJ's efforts, and Trump's executive order. I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral framing, emphasizing the threats to law and order, the violent actions, and the measures taken to counter them.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the task force, then the context of the protests, the DOJ's actions, and ending with Trump's order. I'll use the identified moral words to maintain the original tone and framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions," targeting those who engage in acts of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The initiative aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent violent acts, including looting, arson, and attacks on law enforcement, which have marred recent protests. Barr emphasized that these extremists, including those associated with "Bugaloo" and Antifa, threaten public safety and constitutional values. The task force will work with the FBI to gather intelligence and assist local law enforcement in arresting perpetrators. Meanwhile, President Trump signed an executive order to protect American monuments from destruction, calling for long prison terms for those committing "lawless acts" against the country. The DOJ also warned of foreign entities seeking to sow chaos, highlighting the ongoing threat of violent extremism. END OF SUMMARY.
