SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to address the threat of violent anti-government extremists and restore public safety and law and order. In a memo, Barr noted that recent protests, while mostly peaceful, have been marred by instances of looting, arson, and violence perpetrated by extremist groups. These extremists, Barr wrote, aim to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods to achieve their ends. The task force will focus on investigating and prosecuting violent actors, preventing extremist violence, and ultimately eliminating it as a threat. Barr specifically mentioned 'Bugaloo,' Antifa, and other extremist ideologies as targets of the initiative. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and work closely with the FBI to gather and share information on violent anti-government extremists. Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump's executive order protecting American monuments and memorials from destruction, emphasizing the administration's commitment to combatting criminal violence and lawlessness.
