SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in "indefensible acts of violence" and seek to deny "constitutional rights" to others. These "extremists" aim to spread "anarchy, destruction, and coercion" and undermine the "rule of law" and "public safety". The task force will investigate and prosecute those who commit "violent acts" and work to "ultimately eliminate" the threat of "lawlessness" and "chaos". The move comes as protests against police brutality have turned violent, with "anti-government extremists" engaging in "looting, arson, and violence". The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of "violence" and work to prevent "extremist violence" before it happens. END OF SUMMARY.
