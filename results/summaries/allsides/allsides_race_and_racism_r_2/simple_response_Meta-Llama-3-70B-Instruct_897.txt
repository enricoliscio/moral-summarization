SUMMARY:

Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in acts of anarchy, destruction, and coercion under the guise of promoting freedom and progress. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately eliminate violent extremism that threatens public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that recent protests, while largely peaceful, have been marred by scenes of looting, arson, and violence, with attacks on police officers, destruction of property, and threats to innocent bystanders. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to gather information on extremist individuals, networks, and movements. Barr emphasized that these extremists, including those who support the "Bugaloo" and Antifa, seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods, and may be supported by foreign entities seeking to sow chaos and disorder.
