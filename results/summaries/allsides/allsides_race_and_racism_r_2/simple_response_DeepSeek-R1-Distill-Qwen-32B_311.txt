Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first.

So, Attorney General William Barr created a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. He mentioned in a memo that these groups, despite claiming to support freedom and progress, are actually causing anarchy and destruction. The protests after George Floyd's death were mostly peaceful, but there were instances of violence, looting, and arson. Barr emphasized that while there are peaceful demonstrations, there are also violent acts by extremists, including attacks on police and destruction of property. He also pointed out that some of these groups are linked to foreign entities trying to create chaos.

The task force aims to investigate and prosecute these extremists, prevent violence, and eliminate the threat. It will work with local law enforcement and the FBI to gather information and share it with relevant agencies. Barr's announcement coincided with Trump signing an executive order to protect monuments, which ties into the theme of protecting the rule of law.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the creation of the task force, Barr's characterization of the extremists, the context of the protests, the violent incidents, and the purpose of the task force. Also, mention the link to foreign entities and the executive order.

I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use phrases like "forces of anarchy" and "indefensible acts of violence" as the author did. I'll structure it to show Barr's stance against these groups, the nature of their actions, and the measures being taken to counter them.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Start with Barr establishing the task force. Mention the context of the protests and the violence that occurred. Highlight Barr's description of the extremists and their threats. Then explain the task force's goals and its collaboration with law enforcement. Finally, note the executive order to tie it all together, emphasizing the protection of law and order.

I should keep each sentence concise and ensure the summary flows logically from one point to the next without exceeding the word limit.
