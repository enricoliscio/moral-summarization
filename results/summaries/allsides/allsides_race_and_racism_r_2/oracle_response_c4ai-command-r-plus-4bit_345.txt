SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has created a task force to stop "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions." In a memo, Barr stated that these extremists pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress, but in reality, they are forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr noted that recent protests in response to the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis officer restrained him by kneeling on his neck, have been largely peaceful but have at times descended into looting, arson, and threats to innocent bystanders. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and will work closely with the FBI to develop information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks. Barr's announcement comes as President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments and combatting criminal violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
