Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. He mentions that some groups claim to support freedom but are actually causing anarchy. The context is the protests after George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson. Barr's memo highlights threats to the rule of law, attacks on police, and destruction of property. He also points out that some extremists are supported by foreign entities. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, and prevent such violence, working with local law enforcement and the FBI. Barr's announcement coincided with Trump signing an executive order to protect monuments.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral perspective, emphasizing the threat to the rule of law and constitutional values. I should include the establishment of the task force, the context of the protests, the violent acts, and the foreign influence angle. Also, mention the support for law enforcement and the executive order. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.
