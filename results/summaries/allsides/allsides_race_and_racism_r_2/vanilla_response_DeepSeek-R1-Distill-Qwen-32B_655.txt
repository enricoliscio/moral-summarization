Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Attorney General William Barr creating a task force. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning Barr speaking at a roundtable in June 2020. He established a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists. The announcement was in a memo to department heads and U.S. attorneys, shared by DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec.

In the memo, Barr describes these extremists as forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. The task force aims to investigate, prosecute, prevent, and eliminate these threats. The context is the protests after George Floyd's death, which were mostly peaceful but sometimes turned violent with looting and arson.

Barr points out specific violent acts, like attacks on police, destruction of property, and violence in Seattle's autonomous zone. There were armed groups there, extorting businesses, leading to a lawsuit. The task force will help local law enforcement, train them, and work with the FBI to gather info on extremists.

Barr mentions that some extremists, like those supporting 'Bugaloo' or Antifa, might be supported by foreign entities. He also notes that the DOJ has evidence of planned chaos. The task force is part of a broader effort, as Trump signed an executive order protecting monuments the same day.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: task force creation, its goals, the context of the protests, specific violent incidents, the lawsuit, the collaboration with FBI, mention of foreign influence, and the executive order.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Make sure to include all main elements without going into too much detail.
