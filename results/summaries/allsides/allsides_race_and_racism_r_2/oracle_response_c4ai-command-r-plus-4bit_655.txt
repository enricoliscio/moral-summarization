SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists and restore public safety and the rule of law. Barr's announcement comes in response to recent protests that have descended into scenes of looting, arson, and violence, threatening the freedom and progress of American society. Pretending to profess a message of freedom, these extremists are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion, Barr said in a memo. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and ultimately eliminate it as a threat.

The protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd while in police custody, have seen anti-government extremists engaged in indefensible acts of violence, including attacks on police officers and other government officials, destruction of property, and threats to bystanders. Extremist groups targeted by the initiative seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. Barr noted that these extremists are united in their opposition to the core constitutional values of a democratic society governed by law. 

The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and will work closely with the FBI to develop information on violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks. Barr's announcement comes as President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments and combatting criminal violence, emphasizing the need for long prison terms for lawless acts.
