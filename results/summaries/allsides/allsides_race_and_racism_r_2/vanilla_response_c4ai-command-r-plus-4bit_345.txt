SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr announced the creation of a task force aimed at stopping violent anti-government extremists in the United States. Barr's announcement came in response to recent protests and civil unrest following the death of George Floyd in police custody, which have at times descended into looting, arson, and violence. Barr noted that while peaceful protests are protected by the First Amendment, there have been instances of anti-government extremists engaging in unlawful acts. The task force will focus on investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of violence, preventing future extremist violence, and eliminating it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law. Barr also mentioned the presence of extremist groups with varying ideologies, including those who identify as Antifa and "Bugaloo," who pose a threat to constitutional values and seek to deny the rights of others through illegal methods. The initiative will provide training and resources to local law enforcement and collaborate closely with the FBI to gather and share information on violent extremists. Barr's announcement coincided with President Trump's executive order to protect American monuments and statues from destruction. 

END OF SUMMARY.
