SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to stop violent anti-government extremists and restore public safety and the rule of law. In a memo, Barr noted that while recent protests in response to the death of George Floyd have been largely peaceful, they have also been exploited by anti-government extremists who engage in acts of looting, arson, and violence. These extremists pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress but are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion. Barr said that they deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods, posing a threat to innocent bystanders and law enforcement officials. The task force aims to investigate and prosecute violent perpetrators, prevent extremist violence, and provide training and resources to local law enforcement. Barr's announcement came as President Trump signed an executive order to protect American monuments and combat criminal violence, emphasizing the need for long prison terms for lawless acts.
END OF SUMMARY.
