SUMMARY:
Attorney General William Barr has established a task force to combat "violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions" who engage in "indefensible acts of violence" and "lawlessness." These extremists, who claim to profess a message of freedom and progress, are in fact "forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion." The task force aims to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence, and "ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law." Barr noted that some of these extremists intend to "sow more chaos" and may be supported by "foreign entities seeking to sow chaos and disorder." The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and work closely with the FBI to develop detailed information about violent anti-government extremist individuals and networks.
