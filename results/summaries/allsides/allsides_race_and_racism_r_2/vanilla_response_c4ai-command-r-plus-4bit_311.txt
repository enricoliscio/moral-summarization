SUMMARY: Attorney General William Barr has announced the creation of a task force aimed at stopping violent anti-government extremists. In a memo, Barr stated that recent protests following the death of George Floyd have been "indefensible acts of violence" and that extremist groups seek to deny constitutional rights to others. The task force will investigate and prosecute perpetrators of violence, prevent extremist violence, and provide training and resources to local law enforcement. Barr noted that extremist groups with varying ideologies are united in their opposition to democratic values and that some may be supported by foreign entities. The announcement came on the same day that President Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments and statues from destruction. Barr's memo emphasized the need to uphold the rule of law and protect public safety.

END OF SUMMARY.
