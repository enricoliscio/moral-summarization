Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral aspects involved.

The article describes a church shooting in Texas where a gunman opened fire, killing two people. However, two church security members intervened, fatally shooting the gunman and preventing more casualties. The authorities and officials praised their actions as heroic, highlighting the quick response and the lives saved. The article also mentions the state's gun laws, which allowed the security members to carry weapons in the church. There's a contrast with a previous church shooting in Sutherland Springs, emphasizing the importance of security measures. Additionally, the article notes another attack during a Hanukkah celebration, labeled as domestic terrorism, showing the broader context of violence during the holiday season.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative moral connotation. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

- Evil
- Heroic
- Tragic
- Terrible
- Scariest
- Random
- Violence
- Terrorism
- Domestic terrorism

Wait, I should make sure each of these is indeed a single word and carries a moral charge. "Heroic" is positive, "evil," "tragic," "terrible," "scariest," "random," "violence," "terrorism," and "domestic terrorism" are all negative. I think that's all of them.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping these moral words to preserve the author's framing. I should mention the gunman, the heroic response, the lives saved, the tragic loss, the randomness of the attack, the context of previous incidents, and the broader terrorism angle. I also need to keep it under 200 words.

Let me structure this: start with the event, mention the gunman and the casualties, then the heroic intervention, the lives saved, the tragic loss, the randomness, the context of Texas's gun laws and previous attacks, and end with the other terrorism incident. Make sure to include the moral words where appropriate.

I should avoid any technical jargon and keep it clear and concise. Also, ensure that the flow makes sense and all key points are covered without being too detailed.

Wait, did I miss any morally framed words? Let me check again. The article uses words like "evil," "heroic," "tragic," "terrible," "scariest," "random," "violence," "terrorism," and "domestic terrorism." I think I've covered all of them. 

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary, making sure each moral word is included where it fits naturally. I should also mention the governor's statements and the broader context of hate crimes. 

I think that's a solid approach. Time to draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary moral framing elements.
