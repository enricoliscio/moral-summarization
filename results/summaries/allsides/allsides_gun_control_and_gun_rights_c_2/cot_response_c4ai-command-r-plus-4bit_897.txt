SUMMARY:
A tragic and evil act of violence was perpetrated inside a North Texas church on Sunday, leaving two parishioners and the gunman dead. The attacker opened fire with a shotgun, killing two people before being fatally shot by volunteer security team members. Their heroic actions saved countless lives, according to officials, who condemned the evil act. 

The shooting occurred during a service attended by over 240 people and livestreamed to many homes. The attacker's motive remains unknown. Authorities have praised the quick response of the security team members, who ended the terrifying attack within seconds. Texas' gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons into churches without posted bans, were also hailed as instrumental in preventing further loss of life. 

This incident comes just hours after another attack, where a knife-wielding man stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration outside New York City, an act labeled as domestic terrorism.
