Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a church shooting in Texas where two people were killed, and the security team stopped the gunman. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I need to extract the key points.

First, the main event: a man opened fire in a church, killing two. Then, the security team, made up of volunteers, confronted him and stopped him, saving many lives. That's crucial because it highlights the heroic action. The article mentions the location, White Settlement, and the fact that the church was livestreaming, which might be important for context.

I should note the details like the number of people in the church, the victims being male, and the authorities not knowing the motive yet. Also, the mention of Texas' gun laws and how they allowed the security team to act quickly is significant, as it's a point of discussion in the article.

The article also connects this event to another attack, a knife attack during a Hanukkah celebration, which adds context about recent violent incidents. I should include that briefly to show the broader context.

I need to structure the summary to include the event, the quick response by the security team, the casualties, the lack of motive information, the legal aspect of carrying guns in churches in Texas, and the related attack in New York. I should keep it clear and concise, making sure not to exceed 200 words.

Let me make sure I cover all these points without getting too detailed. I'll start by stating the incident, then the response, casualties, authorities' statements, the legal aspect, and the related event. That should cover the main aspects of the article succinctly.
