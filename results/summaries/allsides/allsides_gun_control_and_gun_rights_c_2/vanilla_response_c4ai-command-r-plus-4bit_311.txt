SUMMARY: Two people were killed and another injured in a shooting at a church in North Texas on Sunday. The gunman was fatally shot by two volunteer members of the church's security team, who were also killed in the incident. The shooting took place at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town near Fort Worth, and was livestreamed to homes across the country. Authorities have not released the names of the victims or the gunman, but officials have praised the actions of the volunteer security team, calling them heroic and saying they saved countless lives. The shooting comes just hours after a stabbing attack at a rabbi's home in New York, which has been labeled an act of domestic terrorism. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has condemned the shooting as an "evil act of violence" and offered prayers for the affected community.
