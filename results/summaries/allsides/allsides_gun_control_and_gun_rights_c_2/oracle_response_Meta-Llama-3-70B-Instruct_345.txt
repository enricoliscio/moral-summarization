SUMMARY:

A tragic and terrible shooting occurred at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, on Sunday, killing two people and wounding others. The gunman, who had roots in the area, pulled out a shotgun and opened fire, but his attack was quickly stopped by two heroic congregants, who drew their weapons and confronted him, saving an "untold number of lives". The Texas Department of Public Safety hailed their actions as "heroic", and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the state's gun laws. The shooting could have been much worse, with over 240 parishioners in the church at the time, but the quick response of the security team prevented further loss of life. The incident is a tragic reminder of the importance of church security, an issue that became a major concern in Texas after a similar attack two years ago. Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" and urged Texans to pray for the affected community. END OF SUMMARY.
