Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

The article describes a church shooting in Texas where two security team members heroically stopped the gunman, saving many lives. It mentions the tragic loss of two people and the quick response that ended the threat. There's also a mention of another attack in New York, highlighting a sense of ongoing violence.

I should focus on the moral elements: the heroism of the volunteers, the tragedy of the loss, and the context of gun laws in Texas. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the main facts without losing the moral undertones.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the event, then the heroic actions, the casualties, and the broader context of security and tragedy. I'll make sure to mention the state's gun laws and the comparison to another attack to emphasize the moral implications.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll check for any key details I might have missed, like the number of people in the church and the aftermath statements from officials. Also, I need to make sure the moral framing is evident, highlighting both the heroism and the sadness of the event.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the original article's tone and content.

SUMMARY: A man opened fire with a shotgun at a North Texas church, killing two people before being fatally shot by two volunteer security team members. Their "heroic" actions, praised by Texas authorities, prevented further loss of life during the attack. The church was livestreaming its service, with over 240 attendees present. The victims, including a security guard, were all male, and the gunman's motive remains unclear. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick highlighted the state's gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in churches unless prohibited. This incident follows a 2017 church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where 26 were killed. The attack occurred hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, labeled as "domestic terrorism." Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the violence and thanked the church members for their quick action. The tragedy underscored both heroism and sorrow, with officials urging prayers for the affected community. END OF SUMMARY.
