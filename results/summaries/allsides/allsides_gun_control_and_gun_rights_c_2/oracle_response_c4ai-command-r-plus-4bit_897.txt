SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire inside a North Texas church on Sunday, killing two people. The attack was quickly brought to an end by two heroic congregants who drew their weapons and confronted the gunman, saving countless lives. The gunman was fatally shot and authorities have not yet determined a motive for the attack. This tragic and terrible incident occurred while more than 240 parishioners were in attendance, and it was livestreamed to countless homes. Among the victims were a security guard and a parishioner, both of whom responded bravely to the shooter. Their actions, along with those of the heroic congregants, prevented further loss of life and protected the congregation. 

The shooting occurred just hours after a separate attack, where a knifewielding assailant stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called this attack an "act of domestic terrorism." These incidents highlight the ongoing issues of violence and the need for continued vigilance and action to protect places of worship and congregations. 

END OF SUMMARY.
