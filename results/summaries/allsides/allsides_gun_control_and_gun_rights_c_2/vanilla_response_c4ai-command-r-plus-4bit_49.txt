SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire in a North Texas church on Sunday, killing two people before being fatally shot by two armed congregants. The shooting took place at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town near Fort Worth, and was brought to a quick end by the heroic actions of the volunteer security team members. The gunman's motive remains unknown, but authorities have confirmed that he had local roots. The security team members, also parishioners, have been praised for their quick response in taking down the shooter and saving countless lives. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hailed their actions and the state's gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons into churches without posted bans. The shooting comes two years after the deadly attack on a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and just hours after a stabbing attack on a rabbi's home in New York. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has condemned the "evil act of violence" and offered prayers for the community affected by the tragedy.
END OF SUMMARY.
