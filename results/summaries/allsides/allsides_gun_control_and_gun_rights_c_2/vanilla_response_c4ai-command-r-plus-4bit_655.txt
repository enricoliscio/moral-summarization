SUMMARY: A gunman opened fire inside a North Texas church on Sunday, killing two people before being fatally shot by two congregants who were part of the church's security team. The attack took place at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town near Fort Worth, with more than 240 parishioners present and the service being livestreamed. The gunman, whose motive remains unknown, was confronted and stopped within six seconds by the volunteer security members, saving an untold number of lives. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hailed their actions as heroic and praised the state's gun laws. The shooting comes just hours after a stabbing attack at a Hanukkah celebration outside New York City, with both incidents sparking fear and outrage nationwide. Texas Governor Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" and offered his prayers for the community affected. The identities of the victims and the gunman have not been released, and the investigation is ongoing.
