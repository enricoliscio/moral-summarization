SUMMARY: A man opened fire inside a North Texas church on Sunday, killing two people before being fatally shot by armed congregants. The attack, which occurred at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town near Fort Worth, was quickly ended by two volunteer members of the church's security team who drew their weapons and confronted the gunman. Authorities have not released the names of the victims or the gunman and the motive remains under investigation. The shooting was livestreamed to homes and witnessed by more than 240 parishioners in the church. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hailed the actions of the congregants, calling them heroic and crediting them with saving countless lives. The incident has brought attention to Texas' gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry loaded weapons into churches that do not ban weapons. The shooting comes just hours after a separate attack on a rabbi's home outside New York City, highlighting the ongoing issue of violence and hate crimes in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
