SUMMARY:

A heroic act by two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas saved countless lives on Sunday when they confronted and fatally shot a gunman who opened fire, killing two people. The quick response, praised by authorities as "heroic," brought an end to the attack within six seconds. The shooting, which occurred during a livestreamed service, could have been much worse, with over 240 parishioners in attendance. The victims, all male, included a security guard who was trying to protect others. Authorities have not released information on the gunman's motive. The incident highlights the importance of church security, an issue that became a concern in Texas after a 2017 church shooting. Gov. Greg Abbott and other officials condemned the "evil act of violence" and praised the bravery of the security team members.
