SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire inside West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, killing two people on Sunday. However, the attack was quickly ended by two volunteer security team members who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, saving an "untold number of lives." The church had over 240 parishioners at the time of the shooting, and the service was being livestreamed. Authorities have not released the names of the victims or the gunman, nor provided a possible motive. The heroic actions of the security team members were praised by officials, including Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who also hailed the state's gun laws. The incident occurred just hours after a Hanukkah celebration in New York was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant.

END OF SUMMARY.
