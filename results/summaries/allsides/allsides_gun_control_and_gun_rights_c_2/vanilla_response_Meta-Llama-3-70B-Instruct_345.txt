SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire inside the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, killing two people on Sunday. However, the attack was quickly brought to an end by two volunteer security team members who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman. Authorities praised the "heroic" actions of the security team, saying they saved an "untold number of lives." There were over 240 parishioners in the church at the time of the shooting, and the service was being livestreamed. The victims and the gunman have not been named, and the motive behind the attack is still unknown. Texas officials have hailed the state's gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry loaded weapons into churches that do not have posted signs banning weapons. The shooting is being investigated, and authorities have condemned the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship.

END OF SUMMARY.
