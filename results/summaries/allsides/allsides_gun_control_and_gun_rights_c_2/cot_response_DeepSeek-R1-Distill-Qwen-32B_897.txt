Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a news article about a church shooting in Texas where two security volunteers saved many lives by confronting the gunman. They want me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

First, I'll go through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "killing," "heroic," "saves," "tragedy," "terrorism," etc., stand out because they evoke strong emotions and moral judgments. I'll list each of these words, making sure not to miss any.

Next, I need to craft a summary that's under 200 words. I'll have to include the key events: the gunman entering the church, the security team's quick action, the fatalities, and the aftermath. I should also incorporate the moral terms identified earlier to maintain the author's framing. I'll make sure the summary is clear and concise, highlighting the heroic actions and the tragic loss, while also mentioning the broader context like Texas's gun laws and the comparison to another terrorist attack.

I should also pay attention to the structure, starting with the main event, then the heroic response, the consequences, and the reactions from officials. This will ensure the summary flows logically and covers all necessary points without being too lengthy.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets the word limit and that all morally framed words are appropriately included. I need to make sure the summary accurately reflects the original article's tone and content while emphasizing the moral aspects as required.

**SUMMARY:**  
A man opened fire with a shotgun at a North Texas church, killing two people. Two volunteer church security members heroically confronted the gunman, fatally shooting him and saving countless lives. The attack, which occurred during a livestreamed service, left two fatalities at the scene and one en route to the hospital. Authorities described the actions of the security team as heroic, preventing further loss of life. The gunman, described as transient, remains unidentified. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the stateâ€™s gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in churches. The incident evoked memories of a 2017 church shooting in Sutherland Springs, where 26 were killed. Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" and expressed gratitude for the quick response of the church members. The attack occurred hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, labeled as an act of domestic terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
