SUMMARY:
A "heroic" act by two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas saved an "untold number of lives" on Sunday. A gunman opened fire, killing two people, but the security team members drew their weapons and fatally shot him within six seconds, bringing a quick end to the "tragic" and "terrible" attack. The shooting, which occurred during a livestreamed service, left three people dead, including the gunman. Authorities praised the security team members' actions, calling them "heroic" and saying they prevented further loss of life. Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" and called for prayers for the affected community. The incident occurred hours after a separate "act of domestic terrorism" in New York, where a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration.
