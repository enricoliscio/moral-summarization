SUMMARY:
An armed attacker opened fire inside a church in North Texas, killing two people. The attacker was fatally shot by two volunteer members of the church's security team, who were hailed as "heroic" for their quick response. The shooting was described as an "evil act of violence" and took place just hours after another attack on a religious community, this time in New York, where a knife-wielding assailant stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the state's gun laws and the parishioners' bravery, stating that they saved an "untold number of lives." The attack left the community shaken, with one witness describing it as the "scariest thing." Texas Governor Greg Abbott condemned the "horrible tragedy" and offered his prayers to the victims and the community of White Settlement. Authorities are still investigating the motive behind the shooting.
