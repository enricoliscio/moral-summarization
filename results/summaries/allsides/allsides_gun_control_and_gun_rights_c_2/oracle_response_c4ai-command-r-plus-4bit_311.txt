SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire inside a North Texas church, killing two people. The attacker was confronted by two volunteer security team members who drew their weapons and fatally shot him, saving countless lives and bringing a quick end to the attack. Authorities have not determined a motive for the shooting, which occurred during a service attended by more than 240 people and livestreamed to many homes. The heroic actions of the security team members, who were among the victims, have been praised by officials. This incident follows another tragic and terrible attack on a place of worship, where a knife-wielding assailant stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the evil act of violence and expressed gratitude for the quick response of the church members who took down the shooter to prevent further loss of life. The Texas church shooting and the New York stabbing have brought attention to issues of security and hate crimes, with officials calling for investigations and increased protection for places of worship.
END OF SUMMARY.
