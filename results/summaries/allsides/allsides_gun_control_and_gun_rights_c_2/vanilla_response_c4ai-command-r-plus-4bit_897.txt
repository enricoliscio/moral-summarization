SUMMARY: On Sunday, a gunman opened fire in a North Texas church, killing two people before being fatally shot by two congregants who were part of the church's security team. The attack was quickly ended thanks to the heroic actions of these volunteers, saving countless lives. The shooting took place in White Settlement, a town near Fort Worth, with over 240 parishioners present and the service livestreamed. Authorities have not released the names of the victims or the gunman and the motive remains unknown. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the state's gun laws and the quick response of the security team, while Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence." The shooting comes just hours after a knife attack at a rabbi's home in New York, which is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism.

END OF SUMMARY.
