SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire inside a North Texas church on Sunday, killing two people. The attack was stopped by two heroic congregants who drew their weapons, confronted the gunman, and fatally shot him. Their quick response saved an untold number of lives, as there were more than 240 parishioners in the church at the time. The incident has been described as a tragic and terrible act of violence, with authorities investigating the motive behind the attack. The shooting occurred just hours after another act of terrorism, where a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration outside New York City. The Texas shooting has brought attention to church security, with officials praising the state's gun laws that allow licensed handgun owners to carry loaded weapons into churches without posted bans. The actions of the two volunteers have been hailed as heroic and have prevented further loss of life.

END OF SUMMARY.
