Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the task. The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible, without losing the essence of the article. The original text is about a church shooting in Texas where two security volunteers saved many lives by confronting the gunman. There's also a mention of another attack in New York.

I should start by identifying the key events: the gunman enters the church, kills two, but is stopped by the security team. The moral words like "pulled," "fire," "killing," "heroic," "saved," etc., need to be included. I also need to mention the other attack in New York, using words like "terrorism" and "stabbled."

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the incident, the heroic response, the aftermath, and the other attack. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all necessary details.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the gunman entering the church, killing two. Then the volunteers confronting him, saving lives. Mention the quick response and the authorities' comments. Then, briefly mention the New York attack as a separate incident.

I need to ensure that all the morally framed words are included without making the summary too wordy. Also, the summary should flow naturally, connecting the events and highlighting the moral aspects like heroism and tragedy.

After drafting, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, ensure that all the key moral terms are present and that the summary accurately reflects the original article's framing.

SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun inside a North Texas church on Sunday and opened fire, killing two people. Two congregants, part of the church's volunteer security team, drew their weapons, confronted the gunman, and fatally shot him, saving countless lives. Their heroic actions brought a quick end to the attack at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement. Authorities described the situation as tragic and terrible, especially during the holiday season. The church service was livestreamed, and more than 240 parishioners were present. The victims, including one security guard, were male, and the gunman's motive remains under investigation. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the stateâ€™s gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in churches unless prohibited. The incident occurred hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called an act of domestic terrorism. Officials in both cases expressed grief and gratitude for those who acted to prevent further violence. END OF SUMMARY.
