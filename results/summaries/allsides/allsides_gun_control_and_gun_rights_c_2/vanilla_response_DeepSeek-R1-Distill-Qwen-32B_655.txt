Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points. 

The article is about a shooting that happened at a church in North Texas. A man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire, killing two people. But it could have been worse because two church security members, who were volunteers, confronted the gunman and fatally shot him, saving many lives. The Texas authorities called their actions heroic.

I should note that the church is in White Settlement, near Fort Worth, and there were over 240 people present. The service was being livestreamed, which might be important for context. The victims and the gunman's identities aren't released yet, but the FBI mentioned he had local roots but was transient.

The article also mentions the state's gun laws, which allow licensed owners to carry weapons in churches unless prohibited. This is relevant because it explains why the security team was armed. There's a reference to a previous church shooting in Sutherland Springs, which probably influenced the church's security measures.

Additionally, there's a mention of another attack during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, where someone stabbed five people. The governor called it domestic terrorism, which shows a connection to the broader context of violence during the holidays.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the main points: the shooting incident, the heroic actions of the security team, the number of casualties, the potential motive being unclear, the state's gun laws, the previous church attack, and the simultaneous Hanukkah attack.

I should structure it logically, starting with the event, then the response, casualties, context on security, and the broader attacks. I'll need to keep it clear and factual without unnecessary details.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and flows well. I'll include the key facts: location, number of victims, the security team's role, the gunman's background, the state's laws, the previous attack, and the simultaneous event in New York. I'll end with the impact and the call for prayers.

I think that covers all the essential elements without going into too much detail. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
