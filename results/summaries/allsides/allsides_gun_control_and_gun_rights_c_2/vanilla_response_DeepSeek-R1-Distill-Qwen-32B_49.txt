Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a shooting that happened at a church in North Texas. A man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire, killing two people. But then, two church security volunteers confronted him, fatally shooting him and stopping the attack. That's the main event.

I should include the key points: where it happened, who was involved, what happened, and the outcome. Also, the fact that the church had a security team because of previous incidents, like the Sutherland Springs shooting two years ago. That context is important.

The article mentions that the service was livestreamed, which adds to the impact. The victims were all male, and the gunman's background is a bit unclear, but he's described as transient. The governor and officials praised the quick response, saving many lives.

I should also note the timing with another attack in New York, which adds to the tragic context. But I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it by first stating the event, then the heroic response, the aftermath, and the broader context.

Let me make sure to include all the main elements without getting too detailed. I'll avoid mentioning every single person's statement unless it's crucial. The summary should flow logically, starting from the attack, the response, the consequences, and the reactions from officials.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: A man opened fire with a shotgun at a North Texas church, killing two people, but two volunteer security members fatally shot the gunman, preventing further loss of life. The incident occurred during a livestreamed service at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement. Authorities described the security team's actions as "heroic," ending the attack within six seconds. All victims were male, and the gunman, with local roots but transient, remains unnamed. The church, which allows licensed handgun owners to carry weapons, had strengthened security after a 2017 mass shooting in Sutherland Springs. Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the attack and praised the quick response. The shooting occurred hours after a knife attack during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, labeled as domestic terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
