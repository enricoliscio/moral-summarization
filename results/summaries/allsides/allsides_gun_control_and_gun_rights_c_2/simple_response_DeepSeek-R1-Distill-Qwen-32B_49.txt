Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a church shooting in Texas where a gunman opened fire, killing two people. However, two volunteer security members stopped him, saving many lives. The moral framing here is about heroism and the effectiveness of having armed security in places of worship, especially after the previous tragedy in Sutherland Springs.

I should highlight the heroism of the security team, the quick response that prevented more casualties, and the context of Texas's gun laws. Also, mentioning the governor's comments on the state's laws could emphasize the moral stance on allowing armed security.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll focus on the main events: the attack, the heroic intervention, the number of people saved, and the aftermath, including the victims and the investigation.

I should also note the connection to another attack during Hanukkah, showing a pattern of violence during holidays, which adds to the moral concern about safety in places of worship.

Let me structure the summary to include these elements, making sure to convey the positive action taken by the security team and the broader implications of such incidents.

SUMMARY: A man opened fire with a shotgun inside a North Texas church, killing two people, but the situation was quickly contained by two volunteer security team members who fatally shot the gunman, saving countless lives. The Texas Department of Public Safety and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the "heroic" actions of the security team, which ended the attack within six seconds. The church, which had over 240 attendees, was livestreaming the service at the time. All victims were male, and the gunman, described as "relatively transient," remains unnamed. Authorities have not provided a motive. The incident occurred hours after a knife attack during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo called an act of domestic terrorism. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the violence and thanked the church members for their quick action. The event highlights the ongoing debate over church security in Texas, following the 2017 Sutherland Springs massacre. END OF SUMMARY.
