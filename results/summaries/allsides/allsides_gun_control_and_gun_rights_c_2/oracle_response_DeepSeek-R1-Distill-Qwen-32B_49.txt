Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points and the emotionally charged words used.

The article describes a church shooting in Texas where a gunman opened fire, killing two. Two volunteer security members stopped him, saving many lives. The author uses words like "heroic," "tragic," and "terrorism" to convey the moral aspects. I need to include these words in the summary.

I'll start by identifying the key events: the gunman's action, the security team's response, the casualties, and the aftermath. I should mention the heroism of the volunteers and the tragedy of the event. Also, noting the context of Texas's gun laws and the comparison to a previous church shooting adds depth.

I'll structure the summary to include the main facts and the moral terms. I'll ensure it's concise, under 200 words, and flows logically from the attack to the response and the aftermath.

Finally, I'll make sure to include all the specified morally framed words without making the summary too lengthy. I'll check for clarity and coherence, ensuring the moral tone is maintained throughout.

SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun inside a North Texas church on Sunday and opened fire, killing two people. The situation could have been far worse, but two volunteer security team members drew their weapons, confronted the gunman, and fatally shot him, saving an untold number of lives. Their heroic actions brought a quick end to the attack. Authorities have not released the names of the victims or the gunman, who is described as relatively transient. The church, which had over 240 parishioners during the service, became the site of a tragic and terrible situation during the holiday season. Licensed handgun owners in Texas can legally carry weapons into churches that do not ban them, a policy highlighted after a similar attack in Sutherland Springs. The gunman’s actions appeared random, and the security guard’s attempt to protect others was described as extremely upsetting. Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the evil act and praised the quick response of the church members. The shooting occurred hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, which was labeled an act of domestic terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
