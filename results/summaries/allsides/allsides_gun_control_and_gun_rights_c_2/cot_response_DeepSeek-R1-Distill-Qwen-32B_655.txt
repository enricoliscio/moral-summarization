Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to spot the morally charged words. Words like "evil," "tragedy," "heroic," "terrible," "random," "terrorism," "scariest," and "upsetting" stand out. These words carry strong moral connotations, so I'll list them in step one.

Next, I'll move on to summarizing the article. I need to capture the main events: the church shooting, the two security members who stopped the gunman, the casualties, and the context of Texas's gun laws. I should also mention the other attack in New York to provide a complete picture.

I have to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral terms. I'll structure it to highlight the heroic actions of the security team, the tragic loss of life, and the context of previous church attacks in Texas. I'll also note the governor's statements and the ongoing investigations.

I should keep each sentence clear and to the point, ensuring that the summary doesn't go over 200 words. I'll double-check that all the important details are included without unnecessary fluff. Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

**STEP 1:**  
* Evil  
* Heroic  
* Terrible  
* Random  
* Terrorism  
* Scariest  
* Upsetting  
* Tragedy  

**SUMMARY:**  
A man opened fire with a shotgun at a North Texas church, killing two people. Two volunteer security team members heroically confronted and fatally shot the gunman, saving countless lives. The attack occurred during a livestreamed service with over 240 parishioners present. Authorities described the situation as tragic and terrible, especially during the holiday season. The gunman, described as transient, had no clear motive. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the stateâ€™s gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in churches. The attack brought back memories of a previous church shooting in Sutherland Springs, where 26 were killed. Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the evil act and thanked the heroic church members for preventing further loss of life. The shooting occurred hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called an act of domestic terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
