SUMMARY: Evil and violence struck again in Texas and New York. Two men were killed in Texas after a gunman opened fire in a church, but his attack was stopped by two heroic parishioners who were part of the church's security team and carried legal weapons, saving countless lives. The attacker was fatally shot within seconds, preventing further loss of life in an act that was praised by Texas officials, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who highlighted the importance of the state's gun laws in allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and others. This tragic event comes just hours after another disturbing attack, this time in New York, where a knife-wielding assailant stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration, leading Gov. Andrew Cuomo to label it an "act of domestic terrorism." These senseless acts of violence, occurring during the holiday season and in places of worship, highlight the ongoing threat of evil in our society and the need for vigilance and quick action to prevent further loss of life. The response of the heroic parishioners in Texas is a testament to the power of good in the face of evil, and their actions will forever be remembered.
END OF SUMMARY.
