SUMMARY:
A heroic act by two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas saved an "untold number of lives" on Sunday. A gunman opened fire, killing two people, but the quick response of the security team brought a swift end to the attack. The Texas Department of Public Safety described their actions as "heroic". The incident was a "tragic and terrible situation", especially during the holiday season. Governor Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship and praised the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter. The shooting occurred just hours after a similar "act of domestic terrorism" in New York, where a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration. END OF SUMMARY.
