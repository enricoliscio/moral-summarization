SUMMARY: A man opened fire in a North Texas church, killing two people before being fatally shot by volunteer security members. The swift actions of these heroes saved countless lives, as there were over 240 parishioners present. This tragic event comes at a time when the issue of church security is prominent in Texas, following a similar shooting two years ago. The state's gun laws allow licensed handgun owners to carry loaded weapons into churches without posted bans. Despite the heroic actions of the security team, two innocent lives were lost, and the community is left reeling. The shooting occurred just hours after an anti-Semitic attack in New York, highlighting the ongoing threat of violence and the need for vigilance and protection in places of worship. Texas Governor Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act" and offered his prayers for the affected community.

END OF SUMMARY.
