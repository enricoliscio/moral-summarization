Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the emotional language used.

The article describes a church shooting in North Texas where a gunman opened fire, killing two people. Two volunteer security members acted heroically to stop him, saving many lives. The author uses words like "heroic," "saved," "tragic," and "terrorism" to convey the moral aspects.

I should start by identifying the main events: the shooting, the quick response by the security team, the number of people present, and the aftermath. I also need to include the emotional impact, such as the tragedy during the holiday season and the community's reaction.

I'll make sure to use the morally charged words provided, like "killed," "saved," "heroic," "tragedy," and "terrorism." I should mention the state's gun laws and the previous church attack in Sutherland Springs to highlight the context.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essential details without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to first describe the event, then the heroic actions, the consequences, and the broader implications.

Let me piece this together, ensuring I include all key points and maintain the moral tone. I'll start with the attack, mention the security team's response, the fatalities, the emotional statements, and the context of church security laws. I'll also touch on the parallel attack in New York to show the broader impact.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without forcing them. The goal is a natural summary that reflects the article's moral framing.

SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun inside a North Texas church on Sunday and opened fire, killing two people. Two volunteer security members heroically confronted the gunman, fatally shooting him and saving countless lives. The attack, described as "heroic" by authorities, ended quickly, preventing further loss. The church, with over 240 parishioners, was livestreaming the service. Two fatalities were confirmed, with a third later reported. The gunman, described as transient, had roots in the area. Authorities have not released names or motives. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the stateâ€™s gun laws, while Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence." The attack occurred hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, labeled "terrorism." The tragedy left the community devastated, with officials calling for prayers. END OF SUMMARY.
