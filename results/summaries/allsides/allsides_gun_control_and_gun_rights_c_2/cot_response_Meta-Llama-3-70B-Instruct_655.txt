SUMMARY:
A "heroic" response by two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas saved an "untold number of lives" on Sunday. A gunman opened fire, killing two people, but the security team members drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman within six seconds. The "tragic" and "terrible" incident occurred during a livestreamed service, with over 240 parishioners present. Authorities praised the "heroic" actions of the security team, saying they prevented a much worse outcome. The motive behind the "evil act of violence" remains unknown. The incident comes just hours after a "terrorism" attack in New York, where five people were stabbed during a Hanukkah celebration. END OF SUMMARY.
