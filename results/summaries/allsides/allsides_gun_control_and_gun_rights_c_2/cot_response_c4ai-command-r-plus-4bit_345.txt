SUMMARY:
An evil act of violence took place at a church in North Texas on Sunday, where a gunman opened fire and killed two people. The brave actions of two volunteer members of the church's security team, who fatally shot the gunman, saved an untold number of lives and brought a swift end to the attack. This heroic act prevented further loss of life and was praised by officials, including Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who commended the state's gun laws. The incident, which occurred during a holiday season, left the community shaken and grieving the loss of two great men. The shooting was condemned by Texas Governor Greg Abbott as an "evil act of violence" at a place of worship. The governor also expressed gratitude for the parishioners who took down the shooter and helped prevent further tragedy. This tragic and terrible event underscores the importance of church security, a pressing issue in Texas since the deadly shooting in Sutherland Springs two years ago. The quick response of the heroic parishioners has been hailed as a brave and selfless act that undoubtedly averted a much worse outcome. END OF SUMMARY.
