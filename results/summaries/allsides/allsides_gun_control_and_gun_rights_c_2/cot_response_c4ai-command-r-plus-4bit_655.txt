SUMMARY: 
An evil act of violence unfolded at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, as a man opened fire on parishioners, killing two people. The heroic actions of two volunteer security team members, who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, saved countless lives and brought a swift end to the tragic attack. The gunman's motive remains unknown, but his actions have been condemned as an evil act of terrorism during a holiday season. The shooting has brought to light the issue of church security in Texas, with licensed handgun owners legally permitted to carry loaded weapons into churches without posted bans. The quick response of the security team members is being praised for preventing further loss of life, with Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick expressing gratitude for their heroic actions. The identities of the victims and the gunman have not been released, but a church elder described the shooting as random and upsetting. This incident, along with a recent stabbing attack during a Hanukkah celebration, highlights the tragic reality of violence and terrorism that continues to plague our society. END OF SUMMARY.
