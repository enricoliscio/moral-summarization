SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire inside West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, killing two people on Sunday. However, the attack was quickly ended by two volunteer security team members who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, saving an "untold number of lives". The shooting occurred during a livestreamed service with over 240 parishioners in attendance. The victims and the gunman were all male, and authorities have not released their names or a possible motive. The Texas Department of Public Safety hailed the security team's actions as "heroic", and Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship. The incident occurred just hours after a similar attack in New York, where a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration.

END OF SUMMARY.
