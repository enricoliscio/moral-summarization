Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

So, a man opened fire in a Texas church with a shotgun, killing two. But two security volunteers stopped him, saving many lives. The article mentions their heroic actions and Texas' gun laws. It also talks about the aftermath, the number of people present, and the impact on the community. There's a mention of another attack in New York related to Hanukkah, which is an anti-Semitic act.

I should highlight the heroism of the volunteers, the quick end to the attack, and the context of Texas' gun laws. Also, the contrast with the New York attack shows the ongoing issues with violence and hate crimes.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the incident, mention the volunteers, the outcome, the context of previous attacks, and the other attack in New York. Conclude with the moral implications and the community's response.

Make sure to include key details like the number of people in the church, the livestream, and the victims. Also, note the governor's statements and the ongoing investigations.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and concise. Ensure the moral framing is present, emphasizing heroism and the importance of security measures.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without exceeding the word limit.
