Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about a church shooting in North Texas where a gunman opened fire, killing two people. Two volunteer security members confronted him, stopping the attack quickly. The moral aspect here is the heroism of the security team and the effectiveness of Texas's gun laws.

I should highlight the heroism and the quick action that prevented more deaths. Also, mention the context about Texas's church security laws and the previous incident in Sutherland Springs.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the shooting, the heroic response, the outcome, and the broader implications of church security laws.

Make sure to include the officials' statements praising the actions and the mention of the possible motive being unknown. Also, note the other attack in New York for context.

I'll structure it to start with the event, then the heroic response, the impact, and the context about laws and previous incidents. End with the call for unity and prayer.

Avoiding any markdown, just plain text. Keep sentences concise and to the point, ensuring the moral framing is clear throughout.

Texas authorities praised the "heroic" actions of the congregants, emphasizing how their quick response prevented further tragedy. The incident occurred during a livestreamed service, with over 240 parishioners present. The victims and gunman's identities remain undisclosed. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick highlighted the state's gun laws, which allow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in churches unless prohibited. This incident follows a 2017 mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs. Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the violence and thanked the church members for their decisive action. The attack occurred hours after a knife attack during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, labeled as "domestic terrorism." Authorities are investigating both incidents, with no motive yet revealed.
