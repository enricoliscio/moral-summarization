SUMMARY: 
A man opened fire in a North Texas church on Sunday, killing two people before being fatally shot by two volunteer members of the church's security team. The attack, which was quickly brought to an end thanks to the heroic actions of the congregants, took place at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town near Fort Worth. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and other officials praised the state's gun laws and the quick response of the security team, which they said saved an "untold number of lives." The shooting, which remains under investigation, comes just hours after another attack on a place of worship, as a knife-wielding assailant stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration outside New York City. Both incidents have been condemned as evil acts of violence and domestic terrorism. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, expressed gratitude for the heroic actions of the church members and sent his prayers to the community affected by the tragedy.
