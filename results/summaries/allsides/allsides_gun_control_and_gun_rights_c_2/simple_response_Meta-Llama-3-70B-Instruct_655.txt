SUMMARY:

A heroic act of self-defense by two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas saved countless lives on Sunday. A gunman opened fire, killing two people, but the quick response of the security team members, who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, brought a swift end to the attack. The Texas Department of Public Safety described their actions as "heroic." The shooting, which occurred during a livestreamed service, could have been much worse, with over 240 parishioners in attendance. The incident highlights the importance of responsible gun ownership and the effectiveness of Texas' gun laws. Authorities have not released information on the motive behind the attack. The community is grieving the loss of two lives, but is also grateful for the bravery of the security team members who prevented further tragedy.
