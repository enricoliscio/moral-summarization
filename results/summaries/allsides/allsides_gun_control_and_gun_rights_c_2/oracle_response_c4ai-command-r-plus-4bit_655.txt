SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire inside a North Texas church on Sunday, killing two people. The attacker was fatally shot and stopped by two volunteer members of the church's security team, who saved countless lives by their heroic actions. This tragic and terrible shooting attack, which occurred during a service with over 240 parishioners, was brought to an end within six seconds by the quick response of the security team members, who drew their weapons and confronted the gunman. The incident occurred just hours after a separate act of domestic terrorism in New York, where a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration. These incidents highlight the ongoing issue of violence and the need for better protection in places of worship. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the state's gun laws and the heroic actions of the security team members, while Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the evil act and offered prayers for the White Settlement community. The names of the victims and the gunman have not been released, and the motive for the shooting remains unknown.
END OF SUMMARY.
