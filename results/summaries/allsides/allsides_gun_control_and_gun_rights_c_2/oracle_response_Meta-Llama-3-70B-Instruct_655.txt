SUMMARY:

A tragic and terrible attack occurred at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, on Sunday, when a man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire, killing two people. The situation could have been far worse, but two heroic congregants, who were volunteer members of the church's security team, drew their weapons and confronted the gunman, fatally shooting him and saving an "untold number of lives". Their quick actions, described as "heroic" by the Texas Department of Public Safety, brought a swift end to the attack. The shooting was stopped within six seconds, preventing further loss of life. The victims were male, and the gunman had roots in the area but was "relatively transient". The incident is being investigated, and authorities have not provided information about a possible motive. The attack is a tragic reminder of the importance of church security, an issue that became a major concern in Texas after a similar incident in Sutherland Springs two years ago.
