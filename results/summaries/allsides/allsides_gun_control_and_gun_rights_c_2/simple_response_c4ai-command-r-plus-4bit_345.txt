SUMMARY: Evil struck again in a place of worship. A man opened fire inside a North Texas church, killing two people, but was quickly stopped by two heroic congregants who were part of the church's security team. Their brave actions saved countless lives, according to authorities. This tragic event, which is still under investigation, highlights the importance of church security and the quick thinking of those who are trained to respond to such situations. The Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the state's gun laws and the parishioners' heroic actions. Governor Greg Abbott also condemned the evil act and expressed gratitude for the quick response of the church members. This shooting, along with the recent anti-Semitic attack in New York, serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of violence and the need for vigilance in protecting our communities. It also underscores the importance of the moral courage shown by those who are willing to put themselves in harm's way to protect others. We must continue to pray for the victims, their families, and the entire community affected by this senseless tragedy.
END OF SUMMARY.
