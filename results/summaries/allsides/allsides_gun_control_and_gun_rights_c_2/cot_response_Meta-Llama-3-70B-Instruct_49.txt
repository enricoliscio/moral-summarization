SUMMARY:
A "heroic" response from two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas saved an "untold number of lives" on Sunday. A gunman opened fire, killing two people, but the security team members quickly drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, bringing a swift end to the attack. Authorities praised their actions, calling them "heroic" and saying they prevented further loss of life. The incident was condemned by Gov. Greg Abbott as an "evil act of violence" at a place of worship. The shooting, which occurred during a livestreamed service, was described as "tragic" and "terrible" by officials. It came hours after a separate attack in New York, which was called an "act of domestic terrorism" by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Texas shooting is under investigation, with authorities yet to release information on a possible motive. END OF SUMMARY.
