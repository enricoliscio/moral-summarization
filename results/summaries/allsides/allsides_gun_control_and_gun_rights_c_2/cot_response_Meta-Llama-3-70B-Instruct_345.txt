SUMMARY:
A tragic and terrible shooting occurred at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, on Sunday, killing two people and injuring others. The heroic actions of two volunteer security team members, who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, brought a quick end to the attack and saved an "untold number of lives." The Texas Department of Public Safety described their actions as "heroic." The gunman, who had roots in the area but was "relatively transient," opened fire during a livestreamed service, causing chaos and panic among the 240 parishioners. The shooting was condemned by Gov. Greg Abbott as an "evil act of violence" at a place of worship. The community is left to mourn the loss of two great men, but it could have been much worse. END OF SUMMARY.
