SUMMARY:

In a heroic display of bravery, two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas drew their weapons and confronted a gunman who opened fire during a Sunday service, killing two people. The quick actions of the security team members, who fatally shot the gunman, saved an "untold number of lives" and brought a swift end to the attack. Authorities praised the "heroic" actions of the security team, who responded within six seconds of the shooting. The incident, which occurred during a livestreamed service, could have been much worse, with over 240 parishioners in attendance. The community is rallying around the church, with officials condemning the "evil act of violence" and calling for prayers for the affected community.

END OF SUMMARY.
