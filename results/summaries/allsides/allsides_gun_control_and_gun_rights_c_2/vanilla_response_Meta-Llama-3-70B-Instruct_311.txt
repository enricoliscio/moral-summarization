SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire inside West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, on Sunday, killing two people. However, the attack was quickly ended by two volunteer security team members who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, saving an "untold number of lives". The shooting occurred during a livestreamed service, with over 240 parishioners present. The victims and the gunman were all male, and authorities have not released their names or a possible motive. The Texas Department of Public Safety hailed the security team's actions as "heroic", and Governor Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship. The incident comes just hours after a Hanukkah celebration stabbing in New York City, which was called "an act of domestic terrorism" by Governor Andrew Cuomo.

END OF SUMMARY.
