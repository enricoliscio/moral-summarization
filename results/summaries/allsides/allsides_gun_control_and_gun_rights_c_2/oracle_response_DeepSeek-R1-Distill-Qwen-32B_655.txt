Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and I have to make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. A man pulled out a shotgun in a church in North Texas, opened fire, killing two people. Two church security members drew their weapons, confronted the gunman, and saved many lives. The attack is under investigation, and the gunman had local roots but was transient. The service was livestreamed, and the incident was captured. The church allows licensed handgun owners to carry weapons, which was a factor after a previous mass shooting in Texas. The governor and others praised the quick response and condemned the violence. There were fatalities and a third death confirmed later. The article also mentions another attack during Hanukkah, which was called an act of domestic terrorism.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary using the moral words provided. I'll structure it to include the key events and the moral implications. I should mention the gunman's actions, the heroic response, the consequences, and the broader context like church security and the other attack.

I should start by stating the event: a man pulled out a shotgun, opened fire, killing two. Then, the security team's actions: drew weapons, confronted, saved lives. Mention the investigation and the gunman's background. Then, the impact, including the livestream and the third fatality. Include the governor's statements about the tragedy and the heroism. Finally, note the other attack and its classification as terrorism.

I need to make sure to use words like "pulled," "fire," "killing," "drew," "confronted," "saving," "attack," "responded," "shooting," "terrorism," "tragic," "saved," etc. I'll aim for a concise summary under 200 words, ensuring all key points are covered with the moral framing intact.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and flows logically. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll review to ensure all important aspects are included and the moral language is preserved.
