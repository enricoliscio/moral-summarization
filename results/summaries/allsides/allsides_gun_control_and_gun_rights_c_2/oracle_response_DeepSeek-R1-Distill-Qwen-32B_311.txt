Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so they want the summary to reflect the author's tone and use of specific morally charged words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events. A man pulled out a shotgun in a church, killed two people, but two security members stopped him, saving many lives. The article mentions the heroism of the security team, the tragedy of the event, and the context of Texas's gun laws. There's also a mention of another attack during Hanukkah, labeled as terrorism.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They include words like "pulled," "fire," "killing," "heroic," "saving," "tragedy," etc. My summary should include as many of these as possible without making it sound forced.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the gunman's actions, the heroic response, the consequences, and the broader context. I should keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to mention the number of fatalities, the quick response by the security team, the state's gun laws, and the other attack for context.

I should also ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral tone, emphasizing the heroism and tragedy without adding my own judgments. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Now, putting it all together, I'll start with the gunman's action, then the security team's response, the fatalities, the context of the attack, and the other incident. I'll use the morally framed words to convey the gravity and heroism as the author did.

I think that's a solid approach. Let me draft the summary accordingly, making sure to include all key points and the moral language.

SUMMARY: A man pulled out a shotgun inside a North Texas church on Sunday and opened fire, killing two people. Two congregants, part of the church's volunteer security team, drew their weapons, confronted the gunman, and fatally shot him, saving countless lives. Their heroic actions brought a swift end to the attack, which remains under investigation. The church, with over 240 parishioners present, was livestreaming the service. MedStar Mobile Healthcare confirmed two fatalities, with a third death later reported by the FBI. All victims were male. Authorities have not released the gunman's identity or motive, but he is described as having local roots but being relatively transient. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick praised the stateâ€™s gun laws, while Gov. Greg Abbott condemned the "evil act of violence" and expressed gratitude for the quick response that prevented further loss of life. The attack occurred hours after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration in New York, labeled as "domestic terrorism" by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. END OF SUMMARY.
