SUMMARY:

A gunman opened fire inside West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, killing two people on Sunday. However, the attack was quickly ended by two volunteer security team members who drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman, saving "untold number of lives". The shooting occurred during a livestreamed service, with over 240 parishioners present. Two fatalities were confirmed at the scene, and a third person died later. The victims were all male. Authorities have not released information on a possible motive or the names of the victims or the gunman. The Texas Department of Public Safety hailed the security team members' actions as "heroic". The incident highlights the importance of church security, which became a major issue in Texas after a 2017 church shooting in Sutherland Springs.

END OF SUMMARY.
