Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the main event is a shooting at a church in North Texas. A man pulled out a shotgun and opened fire, killing two people. But then, two church security volunteers confronted him and fatally shot him, saving many lives. The authorities called their actions heroic. 

The church has over 240 people, and the service was livestreamed. Two died at the scene and another later, all males. The gunman was transient and local. The TexasLt. Gov. praised the state's gun laws. 

Also, there was another attack in New York during Hanukkah, which was called an act of domestic terrorism. The summary needs to include both events, but focus on the church shooting.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the shooting, the heroes, the aftermath, and the other attack. Keep it under 200 words, concise.

I need to make sure to mention the number of victims, the heroic actions, the possible motive unknown, and the connection to previous church attacks in Texas. Also, note the other attack for context.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring all important details are covered without going over the word limit.
