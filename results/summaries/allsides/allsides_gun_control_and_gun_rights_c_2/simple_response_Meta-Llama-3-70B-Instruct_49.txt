SUMMARY:

A heroic act of bravery and quick thinking by two volunteer security team members at West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas saved countless lives on Sunday. When a gunman opened fire, killing two people, the two security team members drew their weapons and fatally shot the gunman within six seconds, bringing a swift end to the attack. The Texas Department of Public Safety hailed their actions as "heroic," and officials praised the state's gun laws, which allowed licensed handgun owners to carry loaded weapons into the church. The shooting, which occurred during a livestreamed service, could have been much worse, with over 240 parishioners in attendance. The community is in shock, with Gov. Greg Abbott condemning the "evil act of violence" and calling for prayers for the affected. The incident is a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance and preparedness in the face of evil.
