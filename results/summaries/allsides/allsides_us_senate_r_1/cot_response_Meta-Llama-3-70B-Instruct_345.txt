SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants who are born alive after an attempted abortion. Despite Democrats' claims that "born-alive" infants don't exist, evidence suggests that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures. Democrats have presented flimsy rationales for their opposition, including the false claim that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. The bill merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion with the same care as any other newborn infant. Opposing this bill implies that the right to abortion encompasses the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant, revealing a dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion. Democrats' opposition to this commonsense legislation exposes the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them rights at birth. END OF SUMMARY.
