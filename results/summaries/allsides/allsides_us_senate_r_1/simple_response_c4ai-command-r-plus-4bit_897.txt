SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which aims to protect infants born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide them with medical care. This bill has exposed the Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion, as 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, there is evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, and the lack of federal law requiring medical care for these infants allows for potential neglect or infanticide. The Democrats' opposition to this bill reveals their dehumanizing rationale for abortion, suggesting that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant. This commonsense legislation aims to protect the rights and well-being of newborn infants, regardless of the circumstances of their birth.

END OF SUMMARY.
