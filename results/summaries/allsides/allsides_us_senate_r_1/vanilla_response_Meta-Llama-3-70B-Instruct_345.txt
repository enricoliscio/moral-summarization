SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have opposed the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, evidence shows that infants do survive late-term abortions, and only 33 states have laws requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to these infants. Democrats argue that the bill is "anti-abortion" and would limit healthcare options, but the bill only requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion like any other newborn infant. The legislation exposes the dehumanizing rationale of the pro-abortion argument, which denies rights to a human being before birth but grants them after birth. If passed, the bill would require doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion.

END OF SUMMARY.
