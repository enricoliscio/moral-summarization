SUMMARY:
The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which reveals the commitment of Democrats to unlimited legal abortion. The bill would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion, exposing the dehumanizing rationale of abortion arguments. Despite the commonsense nature of the bill, 44 Democratic senators voted to block it, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that current laws already prevent infanticide. However, data and anecdotal evidence suggest that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures. The opposition's assertions are flimsy, and their use of the term "anti-abortion" to describe the bill is a willful misrepresentation. The bill does not regulate abortion access but instead ensures that newborns who survive abortions receive the same degree of medical care as any other child born at the same gestational age. The real issue at stake is the belief that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn who was intended for abortion. This exposes the arbitrary nature of granting rights to a human being only after birth, with lawmakers maintaining that it is acceptable to let an infant die if they were intended to be aborted. This bill risks revealing the moral compromising of the pro-choice position, which denies the humanity of unborn children and justifies the murderous crimes of abortionists. END OF SUMMARY.
