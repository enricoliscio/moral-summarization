SUMMARY: The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion, is facing opposition from Democrats in the Senate. The bill was reintroduced by Senator Ben Sasse in response to comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who suggested that mothers and physicians could decide whether to let newborns die or lack care if they survived abortion attempts. Despite the bill's moral implications, 44 Democratic senators voted to block it, claiming that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, this claim is false, as there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide care to infants who survive abortions. The opposition to this bill exposes the dehumanizing and murderous rationale of the pro-choice argument, as it suggests that denying care to newborns who were "targeted" for abortion is acceptable. By opposing this bill, Democrats are essentially supporting the idea that it is acceptable to let an infant die of neglect if it was intended to be killed before birth.

END OF SUMMARY.
