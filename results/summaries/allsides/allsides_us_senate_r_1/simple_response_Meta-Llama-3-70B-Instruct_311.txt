SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have consistently opposed the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, as there is evidence that infants do survive late-term abortions and no federal law requires doctors to provide life-saving care to these infants. Democrats' opposition to the bill exposes their commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion, which includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This dehumanizing rationale is morally reprehensible and highlights the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb while granting them rights immediately after birth. By opposing this bill, lawmakers are essentially saying that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die of neglect.

END OF SUMMARY.
