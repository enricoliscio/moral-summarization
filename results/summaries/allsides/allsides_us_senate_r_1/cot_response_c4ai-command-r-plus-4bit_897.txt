SUMMARY: The Senate is preparing to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes the commitment of Democrats to unlimited legal abortion. This bill would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion, but 44 Democratic senators voted to block it, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. These claims are flimsy and false, and referring to the bill as "anti-abortion" is a last-ditch ploy. The bill does not regulate abortion but merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortions with the same degree of care as any other newborn infant. Opposing this bill exposes the dehumanizing rationale of the argument for abortion, which grants rights to a human being only after birth. Lawmakers who oppose this bill maintain that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die if they were intended to be aborted. While Democrats are likely to block this commonsense legislation again, it exposes the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being based on their location inside or outside the womb.
