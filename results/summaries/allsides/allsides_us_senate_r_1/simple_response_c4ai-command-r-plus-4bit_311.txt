SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. This bill exposes the Democratic Party's commitment to unlimited legal abortion and their dehumanizing rationale. Despite evidence that infants can survive late-term abortion procedures, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist. They also argue that existing laws prevent infanticide, which is false as there is no federal law requiring care for infants who survive abortions. The opposition to this bill reveals a disturbing belief that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn, highlighting the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being based on their location. This bill will expose the immoral and inhumane logic at the heart of the argument for unlimited abortion access.
END OF SUMMARY.
