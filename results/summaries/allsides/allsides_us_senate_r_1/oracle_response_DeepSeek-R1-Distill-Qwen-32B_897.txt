Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words the author used. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, introduced by Senator Ben Sasse. The bill requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. The author criticizes Democrats for opposing this bill, claiming they support unlimited abortion rights, even if it means letting newborns die.

The article mentions that 44 Democrats voted against the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants don't exist, which is false based on cases like Kermit Gosnell. They also say existing laws prevent infanticide, but only 33 states have such protections, and some have repealed them. The author argues that the bill isn't anti-abortion but about treating newborns, and opposing it dehumanizes the argument for abortion.

Now, I need to craft a summary using the morally framed words. I'll start by introducing the bill and its purpose. Then, mention the Democratic opposition and their arguments. Highlight the lack of federal laws and the dehumanizing aspect. Conclude with the bill's purpose to expose the moral issues.

I should make sure to include words like require, care, die, lack, block, afforded, opposition, claim, murderous, pivot, infanticide, false, repealed, voted, limiting, treat, misrepresenting, deny, targeted, dehumanizing, abortion, denying, neglect, killed.

Putting it all together concisely, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that highlights Democrats' stance on unlimited legal abortion. The legislation requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the bill in 2019, following Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's controversial remarks about allowing nearly aborted newborns to die. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming "born-alive" infants don't existâ€”a claim contradicted by cases like Kermit Gosnell. Democrats also falsely argue that existing laws prevent infanticide, though no federal law mandates care for newborns who survive abortions. Only 33 states have such protections, with New York repealing its law. Democrats label the bill "anti-abortion," but it doesn't regulate abortion access; it merely requires treating newborns born alive the same as any other newborn. Opposing the bill suggests that abortion rights include the right to deny medical care to a newborn targeted for abortion. This dehumanizes the argument for abortion, as it implies denying rights to a fetus while granting them immediately after birth. The bill exposes the moral inconsistency in allowing infants to die from neglect if they survive an abortion. END OF SUMMARY.
