SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. The bill exposes the Democratic Party's support for unlimited legal abortion and their opposition to protecting infants who survive abortions. Despite anecdotal and reported evidence of infants surviving late-term abortion procedures, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. These claims are false, as there is no federal law requiring care for infants who survive abortions, and some states have repealed born-alive protections. The Democrats' opposition to this bill reveals their dehumanizing rationale for abortion, suggesting that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant. The bill's supporters argue that it is a commonsense measure to protect newborn infants and expose the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being based on their location.

END OF SUMMARY.
