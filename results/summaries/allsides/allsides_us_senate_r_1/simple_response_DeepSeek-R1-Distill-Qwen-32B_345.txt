Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and how it highlights the Democrats' stance on abortion. 

First, I should identify the key points. The bill requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced it, and it was blocked by 44 Democrats. They argue that "born-alive" infants don't exist, but there's evidence they do. Democrats also say existing laws prevent infanticide, but only 33 states have such laws, and New York repealed theirs. The article criticizes the Democrats for opposing the bill, calling it "anti-abortion" without basis, and points out the moral inconsistency in supporting abortion rights while denying care to newborns. 

I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral argument against the Democrats' position, emphasizing the dehumanization aspect. Also, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by introducing the bill, mention the opposition from Democrats, their arguments, the counterarguments, and the moral critique. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that underscores Democrats' support for unlimited legal abortion. The legislation mandates that doctors provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Introduced by Senator Ben Sasse, it was blocked last year by 44 Democrats, who argued that "born-alive" infants don't exist, a claim contradicted by evidence, including cases like abortionist Kermit Gosnell. Democrats also falsely claim existing laws prevent infanticide, though only 33 states have such protections, with New York repealing its law. Critics argue the bill is misrepresented as "anti-abortion," while it merely requires treating newborns born after abortions the same as other newborns. The article highlights the moral inconsistency in supporting abortion rights while denying care to newborns, exposing the dehumanizing logic behind abortion arguments. END OF SUMMARY.
