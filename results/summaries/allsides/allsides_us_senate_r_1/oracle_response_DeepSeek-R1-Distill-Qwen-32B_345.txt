Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on maintaining the author's perspective and the key moral terms used.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about the Senate considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It criticizes Democrats for opposing the bill, which requires medical care for infants born alive after an abortion. The author uses strong moral language, so I need to include words like "require," "care," "die," "lack," etc.

I notice the author mentions Senator Ben Sasse reintroducing the bill and the opposition from Democrats, including their claims that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws prevent infanticide. The author refutes these points, citing cases like Kermit Gosnell and the lack of federal laws. Also, the article points out that some states, like New York, have repealed their protections.

The user wants the summary to be no longer than 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll start by stating the Senate is considering the bill, then outline the Democratic opposition and their rationales. I'll include the author's arguments against these rationales, the lack of federal laws, and the moral implications of the Democrats' stance.

I should make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible without making the summary too verbose. I'll structure it to highlight the contrast between the bill's intent and the Democrats' arguments, emphasizing the moral issues involved.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the bill's introduction, moving to the opposition, the refutation of their claims, and the moral critique of their stance on abortion rights. I'll end with the implication that supporting the bill would expose the arbitrary nature of abortion rights, maintaining the author's critical tone.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that highlights Democrats' support for unlimited legal abortion. The legislation mandates that doctors provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the bill in 2019 following Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's controversial remarks about allowing nearly aborted newborns to die. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming "born-alive" infants do not exist, a claim contradicted by evidence, including the case of abortionist Kermit Gosnell. Democrats also falsely assert that existing laws prevent infanticide, though no federal law requires doctors to treat abortion survivors. Only 33 states have such protections, with New York repealing its law. Critics argue the bill is "anti-abortion," but it does not restrict abortion access; it merely requires treating newborns who survive abortions the same as any other newborn. The author accuses Democrats of dehumanizing infants by denying them care if they were targeted for abortion. Blocking the bill exposes the moral inconsistency of supporting abortion while opposing care for infants born alive. END OF SUMMARY.
