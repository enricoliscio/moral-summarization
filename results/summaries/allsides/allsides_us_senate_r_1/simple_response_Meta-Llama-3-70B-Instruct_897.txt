SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have consistently opposed this bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist, and that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, and the bill simply requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion the same way they would treat any other newborn infant. By opposing this bill, Democrats are exposing their commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion, which includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This dehumanizing rationale is at the heart of the argument for abortion, and it is morally reprehensible. The bill's passage would expose the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them rights after birth.

END OF SUMMARY.
