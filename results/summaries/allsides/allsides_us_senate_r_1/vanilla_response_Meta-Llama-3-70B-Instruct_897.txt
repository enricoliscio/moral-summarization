SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. The bill aims to protect newborns from being left to die without care. Democrats have opposed the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, evidence shows that infants do survive late-term abortions, and only 33 states have laws requiring doctors to provide life-saving care. Democrats also argue that the bill is "anti-abortion," but it only requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion like any other newborn. The bill exposes the dehumanizing rationale behind the argument for abortion, which grants rights to a human being only after birth. If passed, the bill would require doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion.

END OF SUMMARY.
