Okay, I need to summarize this article about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article talks about the Senate considering this bill. The bill requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. That's a main point.

Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the bill in 2019 after Governor Northam's controversial comments. I should mention that context because it sets the stage for why the bill is being discussed again.

Next, the article mentions that 44 Democrats voted to block the bill. It's important to note their opposition and the reasons they gave. They claim "born-alive" infants don't exist, but the article counters this with examples like Kermit Gosnell and the lack of federal laws.

I should also highlight the argument that the bill doesn't restrict abortion access but only requires care for surviving infants. The Democrats' opposition is portrayed as dehumanizing, suggesting they support letting infants die if they survive an abortion.

Finally, the article points out the inconsistency in supporting abortion rights but denying care to born-alive infants. This is a crucial point to include as it's the main argument against the Democrats' stance.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. I'll structure it to first introduce the bill, then the context, followed by the opposition's arguments and the counterarguments, and conclude with the underlying issue of dehumanization.

SUMMARY:  
The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which mandates medical care for infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the bill in 2019 following Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's controversial comments suggesting that nearly aborted newborns could be left to die. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming "born-alive" infants do not exist or that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, evidence shows infants do survive abortions, and only 33 states have laws requiring medical care for such cases. Critics argue the bill does not restrict abortion access but simply requires treating born-alive infants like any other newborn. Democrats, however, oppose it, framing it as "anti-abortion" and claiming it interferes with women's health choices. The article argues that opposing the bill reveals a dehumanizing logic, as it suggests abortion rights include the right to let a newborn die if they survive an abortion. END OF SUMMARY.
