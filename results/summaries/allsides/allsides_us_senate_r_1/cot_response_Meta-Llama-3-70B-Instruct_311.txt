SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants who are born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have opposed the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false and flimsy. The reality is that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures with some regularity, and there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to these infants. Democrats' opposition to the bill reveals a dehumanizing rationale that denies rights to a human being inside the womb and grants them rights only after birth. This arbitrary stance is morally reprehensible, and lawmakers who oppose the bill are essentially supporting the right to let an infant die of neglect. END OF SUMMARY.
