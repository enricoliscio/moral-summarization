SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. The bill aims to expose Democrats' stance on unlimited legal abortion. In 2019, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, evidence suggests that infants do survive late-term abortions, and only 33 states have laws requiring life-saving care. Democrats also claim the bill is "anti-abortion," but it only requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion like any other newborn. The bill's opponents believe the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant. The legislation aims to expose the dehumanizing rationale behind the argument for abortion.
