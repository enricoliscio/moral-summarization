SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which aims to protect infants born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide them with medical care. This bill has exposed the Democratic Party's commitment to unlimited legal abortion and their dehumanizing rationale. 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, there is anecdotal and reported evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, and current federal law does not require doctors to provide life-saving care to these infants. The opposition's argument that the bill is "anti-abortion" is misleading as it does not regulate abortion availability but ensures equal medical treatment for newborns, regardless of the circumstances of their birth. The real issue at hand is the belief that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn, which reveals the arbitrary nature of granting rights based on location. The Born-Alive Act will expose the immorality of this rationale, despite likely facing Democratic opposition again.

END OF SUMMARY.
