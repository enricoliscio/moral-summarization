SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which aims to protect infants born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide them with medical care. This bill has exposed the Democratic Party's support for unlimited legal abortion. Despite evidence to the contrary, Democrats argue that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, there is no federal law requiring medical care for infants who survive abortions, and some states like New York have even repealed their born-alive protections. Democratic lawmakers and their media allies refer to the bill as "anti-abortion," but it does not regulate abortion access. Instead, it ensures that newborns who survive abortions receive the same medical care as any other infant. The opposition to this bill reveals the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion, where a newborn's right to medical care is contingent on whether they were intended to be aborted.
END OF SUMMARY.
