SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which aims to protect infants born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide them with medical care. This bill has exposed the Democratic Party's commitment to unlimited legal abortion and their opposition has been based on flimsy rationales. Democrats claim that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide, both of which are false. They also argue that the bill is "anti-abortion," despite it only requiring doctors to treat newborns who survive abortions the same as any other infant. The real issue at hand is the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion. The Born-Alive Act challenges the idea that a human being can be denied rights up until birth, and granted rights only after. The bill is expected to be blocked once more by Democrats, but it has succeeded in exposing the extreme nature of their position on abortion.
END OF SUMMARY.
