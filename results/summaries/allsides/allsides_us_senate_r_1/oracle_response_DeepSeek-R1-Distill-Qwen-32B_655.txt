Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the political debate around it. The author uses strong moral language, so I should make sure to include those words in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The Senate is considering this bill that requires doctors to provide care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced it, and there's opposition from Democrats. They've blocked it before, and the author is critical of their reasoning.

The author points out that Democrats argue "born-alive" infants don't exist, but there's evidence they do, like the Kermit Gosnell case. Also, only 33 states have such laws, and some, like New York, have repealed them. The author criticizes the Democrats for misrepresenting the bill as "anti-abortion" when it's really about treating newborns.

I need to include the morally framed words: require, care, die, lack, block, afforded, opposition, claim, murderous, pivot, infanticide, false, repealed, voted, limiting, treat, misrepresenting, deny, targeted, dehumanizing, abortion, denying, neglect, killed.

So, the summary should mention the bill requiring care, the opposition from Democrats, their claims being false, the repeal of laws, the misrepresentation, and the dehumanizing aspect of their stance.

I'll structure it to highlight the moral issues: the requirement to provide care, the blocking of the bill, the false claims, the repeal, and the dehumanizing argument that abortion includes letting infants die.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral language.

SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which requires doctors to provide care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the bill, which was blocked by 44 Democratic senators in 2019. Democrats claim "born-alive" infants don't exist, but evidence shows they do, as seen in cases like Kermit Gosnell. Only 33 states have laws requiring such care, and New York repealed its protections. Democrats falsely claim existing laws prevent infanticide, but no federal law mandates care for these infants. The bill doesn't regulate abortion access but mandates treating newborns born alive the same as any other newborn. Critics argue it's "anti-abortion," but this misrepresents its purpose. The bill's opposition highlights the dehumanizing argument that abortion includes the right to let an infant die if it was targeted for abortion. This stance denies rights to a newborn based on intent, exposing the arbitrary nature of abortion rights. END OF SUMMARY.
