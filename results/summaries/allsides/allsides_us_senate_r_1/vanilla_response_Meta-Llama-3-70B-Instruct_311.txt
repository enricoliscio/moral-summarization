SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. The bill aims to expose Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion. In 2019, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. However, evidence shows that infants do survive late-term abortions, and only 33 states have laws requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to these infants. Democrats argue that the bill is "anti-abortion" and would limit healthcare options, but it simply requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion like any other newborn. The bill's passage would expose the dehumanizing rationale behind the argument for abortion, highlighting the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them rights after birth.

END OF SUMMARY.
