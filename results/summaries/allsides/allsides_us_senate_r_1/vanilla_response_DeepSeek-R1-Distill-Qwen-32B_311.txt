Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Senate considering this bill, which requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. It mentions that Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced it in 2019 after Governor Ralph Northam's comments. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted against it, blocking the bill.

The Democrats have given weak reasons for opposing the bill. They first claim that "born-alive" infants don't exist, but the article counters this with examples like Kermit Gosnell and mentions that some states have such laws, though not all. They also argue that existing laws prevent infanticide, but the article points out that there's no federal law requiring medical care for these infants.

Another point is that Democrats call the bill "anti-abortion," but the article clarifies that the bill doesn't restrict abortion access. Instead, it just mandates treating born-alive infants the same as any other newborn. The article suggests that supporting this bill would challenge the pro-choice stance because it questions the morality of denying care to an infant born just moments after an abortion attempt.

I should make sure the summary captures all these elements: the bill's purpose, the political context, the Democratic opposition, their rationales, the counterarguments, and the implications for the abortion debate.

Let me structure the summary to include the reintroduction of the bill, the Democratic vote against it, their reasons, the counterarguments about the existence of born-alive infants and existing laws, the mislabeling as anti-abortion, and the moral dilemma it presents.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Also, I should end with the token as specified.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill requiring doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the legislation in 2019 following Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's controversial remarks about post-abortion care. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants do not exist, a claim contradicted by evidence such as the case of abortionist Kermit Gosnell. Democrats also claimed existing laws prevent infanticide, though no federal law mandates care for infants who survive abortions, and only 33 states have such protections. Critics argue the bill is "anti-abortion," but it does not restrict abortion access; it merely requires treating born-alive infants like any other newborn. The article highlights the moral dilemma: supporting the bill could challenge the pro-choice stance by questioning the denial of rights to infants born just moments after an abortion attempt. END OF SUMMARY.
