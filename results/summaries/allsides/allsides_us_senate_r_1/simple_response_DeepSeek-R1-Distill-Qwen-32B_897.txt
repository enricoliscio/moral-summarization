Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act being considered by the Senate. It's presented as exposing Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced it in 2019 after Governor Northam's controversial comments about letting newborns die in some cases. 

The article mentions that 44 Democratic senators voted against the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist, which is refuted by cases like Kermit Gosnell. It also points out that only 33 states have laws requiring such care, with New York repealing theirs. Democrats argue the bill is "anti-abortion," but the article counters that it doesn't restrict abortion access but mandates care for surviving infants. 

The moral framing here is that opposing the bill implies supporting letting newborns die if they were meant to be aborted. The article suggests this shows the dehumanizing logic behind abortion rights.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral argument intact. I'll focus on the bill's purpose, the Democratic opposition, the rationales given, and the underlying moral issue. I should make sure to highlight the contrast between the bill's intent and the implications of opposing it, emphasizing the moral stance on the value of life.

I should structure it by introducing the bill, the context of its reintroduction, the Democratic response, their arguments, the counterarguments, and the moral implication. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and maintains the original's critical tone towards the Democrats' stance.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within the limit. Also, I'll use clear and concise language to convey the points without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to debate the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that highlights Democrats' support for unlimited legal abortion. The legislation mandates that doctors provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion, challenging the notion that such infants do not exist or that existing laws protect them. Proponents argue that data, including cases like Kermit Gosnell, show that infants do survive abortions, yet only 33 states have laws requiring such care. Democrats have opposed the bill, claiming it is "anti-abortion," but critics argue it merely requires treating newborns born after abortions the same as any other newborn. The moral debate centers on whether denying care to these infants is acceptable, with opponents suggesting that abortion rights include the right to let such infants die. The bill aims to expose the dehumanizing logic behind abortion rights, questioning the arbitrary distinction between a fetus and a newborn. END OF SUMMARY.
