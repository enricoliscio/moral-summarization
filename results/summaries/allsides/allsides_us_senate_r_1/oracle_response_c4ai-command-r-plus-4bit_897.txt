SUMMARY: The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion, is once again being considered by the Senate. This bill exposes the Democratic Party's commitment to unlimited legal abortion and their opposition to protecting infants who survive abortion attempts. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the legislation in 2019 after Virginia governor Ralph Northam suggested that mothers and physicians could decide whether to let nearly aborted newborns die from lack of care. Despite anecdotal and reported evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the born-alive bill, claiming that such infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide care to infants who survive abortions, and some states, like New York, have even repealed their born-alive protections. The Democrats' opposition to this bill reveals their dehumanizing rationale for abortion and their belief that the right to abortion includes the right to deny care and let an infant die of neglect.

END OF SUMMARY.
