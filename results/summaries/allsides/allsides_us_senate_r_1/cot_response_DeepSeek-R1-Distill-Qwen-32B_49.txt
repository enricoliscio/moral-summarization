Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided specific instructions, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.

First, I need to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. That means looking for words that carry strong ethical or moral connotations. Words like "exposes," "commitment," "unlimited," "protection," etc. I'll go through the article sentence by sentence and pick out these words, each on a new line with a *.

Next, I have to write a summary of the article. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and include as many of those morally framed words as possible. I need to make sure the summary captures the essence of the article, focusing on the moral arguments presented, especially regarding the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and the Democrats' opposition.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key points: the bill's purpose, the opposition from Democrats, their rationales, and the moral implications. I need to use the identified words to maintain the original moral framing, ensuring the summary is both accurate and reflects the author's stance.

I also need to remember to format the response correctly, starting with "STEP 1:" listing each word, then the "SUMMARY:" followed by the concise summary, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

Let me start by reading through the article again to make sure I catch all the morally charged words. Then, I'll compile the list and craft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and maintains the moral perspective.

**SUMMARY:**  

The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which highlights Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion. The bill mandates doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced it in 2019 after Virginia Governor Ralph Northam suggested that newborns could be left to die in some cases. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming "born-alive" infants don’t exist or that existing laws prevent infanticide. However, evidence shows infants do survive abortion procedures, and no federal law requires medical care for them. Democrats also label the bill as "anti-abortion," arguing it interferes with women’s health-care choices. Yet, the bill doesn’t regulate abortion access—it only requires treating born-alive infants like any other newborn. Opponents argue that supporting the bill would expose the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a fetus while granting them to a newborn. The legislation aims to challenge the dehumanizing rationale behind abortion rights, forcing lawmakers to confront the moral implications of letting infants die if they were intended to be aborted. END OF SUMMARY.
