SUMMARY: The Senate is preparing to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that exposes the moral commitment of Democrats to unlimited legal abortion. The bill, reintroduced by Senator Ben Sasse, requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. This exposes the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion. The Democrats' opposition to this bill reveals their commitment to the logic of unlimited abortion, even to the point of infanticide. They deny the existence of "born-alive" infants and claim that laws against infanticide already exist, which is false. This commonsense legislation will succeed in exposing the crucial, yet arbitrary, moral decision-making of lawmakers who oppose it. The bill's opponents maintain that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die if it was intended to be aborted. This reveals the dehumanizing rationale of denying a newborn infant the right to medical care simply because it was targeted for abortion. The bill is a moral test for lawmakers, risking exposing the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them only after birth. END OF SUMMARY.
