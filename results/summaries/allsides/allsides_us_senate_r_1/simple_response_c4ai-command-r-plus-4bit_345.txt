SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. This bill exposes the Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion and their dehumanizing rationale. Despite evidence that infants can survive late-term abortion procedures, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. In reality, only 33 states have laws requiring life-saving care for infants who survive abortions, and New York recently repealed its born-alive protections. The Democrats' opposition to this bill reveals their belief that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant, which is a morally abhorrent position. This bill will expose the arbitrary and inhumane nature of their argument, as it simply requires equal medical treatment for newborns, regardless of whether they were targeted for abortion or not.
END OF SUMMARY.
