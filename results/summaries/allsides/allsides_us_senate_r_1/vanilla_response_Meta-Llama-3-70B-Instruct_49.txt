SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. The bill aims to protect newborns who survive late-term abortions, a scenario that Democrats claim is rare or non-existent. However, evidence suggests that infants do survive such procedures. Democrats have opposed the bill, citing that laws already exist to prevent infanticide, but this is false as there is no federal law requiring life-saving care for infants who survive abortions. The bill does not regulate abortion access, but rather ensures that newborns receive the same care as any other infant. Democrats' opposition to the bill exposes their commitment to unlimited legal abortion and raises questions about the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being before birth and granting them after. 

END OF SUMMARY.
