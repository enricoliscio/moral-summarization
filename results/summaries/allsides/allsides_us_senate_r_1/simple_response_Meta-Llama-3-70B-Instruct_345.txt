SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have consistently opposed this legislation, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, and the lack of federal law requiring life-saving care to infants who survive abortions is a glaring gap. Democrats' opposition to this bill exposes their commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion, which includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This dehumanizing rationale is morally reprehensible, and lawmakers who oppose this bill are essentially arguing that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die of neglect. The bill's commonsense provisions will succeed in exposing the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them rights after birth. END OF SUMMARY.
