SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Despite Democrats' claims that "born-alive" infants don't exist, evidence suggests that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures. Democrats also argue that laws already exist to prevent infanticide, but this is false, as there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. The bill's opponents claim it's "anti-abortion," but it merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion like any other newborn infant. This legislation will succeed in exposing the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion. END OF SUMMARY.
