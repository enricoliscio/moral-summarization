SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. This bill exposes the moral dilemma of Democrats' support for unlimited legal abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the legislation in response to comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam, suggesting that mothers and physicians could decide whether to let nearly aborted newborns die from lack of care. 44 Democratic senators blocked the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, there is evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, and federal law does not require doctors to provide care in the context of abortion. The opposition's claims are false and misleading, and their characterization of the bill as "anti-abortion" is a willful misrepresentation. The bill merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortions the same as any other newborn infant. The real issue is the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the abortion debate. By opposing this bill, Democrats maintain that abortion includes the right to let an infant die of neglect if they were intended to be killed during the procedure.
END OF SUMMARY.
