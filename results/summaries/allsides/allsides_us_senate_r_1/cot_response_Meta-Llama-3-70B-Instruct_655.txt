SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Despite Democrats' claims that "born-alive" infants don't exist, there is evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures. Democrats also argue that laws already exist to prevent infanticide, but this is false, as there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. The bill is not "anti-abortion," but rather requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion with the same care as any other newborn infant. Opposing this bill reveals a dehumanizing rationale that denies rights to a human being, and lawmakers who support it risk exposing the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them rights after birth. END OF SUMMARY.
