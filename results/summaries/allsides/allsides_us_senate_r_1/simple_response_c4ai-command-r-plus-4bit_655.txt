SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which aims to protect infants born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide them with medical care. This bill exposes the Democrats' support for unlimited legal abortion, as 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, there is evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, and current federal law does not require doctors to provide care to these survivors. The opposition's claims that the bill is "anti-abortion" are misleading, as it does not regulate abortion access but rather ensures that newborns who survive abortions receive the same medical care as any other infant. The debate around this bill reveals the dehumanizing rationale of the pro-choice argument, where a human being's rights are denied until birth. The Born-Alive Act highlights the moral dilemma of allowing infants to die of neglect simply because they were intended to be aborted.
