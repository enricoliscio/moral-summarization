SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion. This bill exposes the Democratic Party's commitment to unlimited legal abortion. Despite the fact that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. These claims are false and misleading, as there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide care to infants who survive abortions. The opposition to this bill reveals a dehumanizing rationale and a willingness to deny care and let infants die of neglect, which is morally abhorrent. The bill's requirement to treat newborns who survive abortions as any other newborn infant is commonsense legislation that should be supported by all lawmakers who value human life and decency.

END OF SUMMARY.
