SUMMARY: 
The Senate is preparing to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes the commitment of Democrats to the logic of unlimited legal abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the bill in response to comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam, suggesting that mothers and physicians could decide whether to leave nearly aborted newborns to die. 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, which requires that newborns receive the same degree of care as any other child born at the same gestational age. The opposition's rationale is flimsy and false, with claims that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. The bill is mislabeled as "anti-abortion," with Democratic lawmakers arguing it limits health-care options for women. However, the bill merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortions with the same care as any other infant. 

The crucial point is that anyone who opposes this bill is essentially arguing that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn who was intended for abortion. This exposes the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion. Lawmakers who oppose this bill maintain that abortion rights include the right to let an infant die if they were planned to be aborted. Democrats are likely to block this commonsense legislation once more, but it succeeds in exposing the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being based on their location inside or outside the womb. END OF SUMMARY.
