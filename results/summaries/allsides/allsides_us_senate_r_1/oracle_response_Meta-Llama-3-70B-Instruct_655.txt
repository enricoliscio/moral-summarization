SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have consistently opposed this legislation, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, as evidenced by the case of Kermit Gosnell and the fact that only 33 states have laws requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. Democrats' opposition to the bill exposes their commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion, which includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This dehumanizing rationale is morally reprehensible, as it suggests that the right to abortion encompasses the right to let an infant die of neglect if they were planned to have been killed a second before. The bill's requirement that doctors treat newborns who survive abortion with the same care as any other newborn infant is a matter of basic decency.

END OF SUMMARY.
