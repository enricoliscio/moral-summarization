SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that reveals the Democratic Party's support for unrestricted legal abortion. The bill, reintroduced by Senator Ben Sasse, would require doctors to provide standard medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Despite anecdotal and reported evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill in February 2019, arguing that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. These claims are false, as there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide care to infants who survive abortions, and some states like New York have repealed born-alive protections. The Democrats also characterize the bill as "anti-abortion," suggesting it limits women's healthcare options, when in fact, it only mandates equal medical care for newborns regardless of the circumstances of their birth. The bill exposes the dehumanizing rationale of the pro-choice argument, as opposing it implies support for allowing infants to die of neglect if they were intended to be aborted.
END OF SUMMARY.
