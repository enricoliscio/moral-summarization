SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have opposed the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist, and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, and there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. Democrats' opposition reveals a dehumanizing rationale, suggesting that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. By blocking the bill, Democrats are effectively supporting the right to let an infant die of neglect if they were planned to have been killed a second before. This legislation will succeed in exposing the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside their mother and granting them rights the instant after birth. END OF SUMMARY.
