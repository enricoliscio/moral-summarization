SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants who are born alive after an attempted abortion. Despite Democrats' claims that "born-alive" infants don't exist, there is evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures. Democrats have presented flimsy rationales for their opposition, including the false assertion that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. In reality, there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. The bill's opponents maintain that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die of neglect, revealing a dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion. This commonsense legislation will succeed in exposing the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside his mother and granting him rights the instant after birth. END OF SUMMARY.
