SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have presented flimsy rationales for their opposition, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist and that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, and there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. Democrats' opposition to the bill reveals a dehumanizing rationale that denies rights to a human being inside the womb and grants them rights only after birth. By voting against the bill, lawmakers maintain that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die of neglect if they were planned to have been killed a second before. This morally reprehensible stance is a stark reminder of the importance of protecting the most vulnerable among us.
