Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I need to make sure I include the morally charged words the author used, like "require," "care," "die," etc. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The bill requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Democrats oppose it, claiming such infants don't exist or that existing laws are sufficient. The author argues that the bill is commonsense and exposes the dehumanizing aspects of abortion arguments.

I should start the summary by introducing the bill and its purpose. Then, mention the reintroduction by Senator Sasse and the Democrats' opposition. I need to include their rationales and the author's counterpoints. Also, highlight the moral implications, like dehumanization and neglect.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and use as many of the specified moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the bill, then the opposition, their arguments, the author's critique, and the moral stance.

Let me make sure I don't miss any key points. The bill's requirement, the lack of existing federal laws, the repeal by New York, and the Democrats' tactics to block it. Also, the author's point that supporting the bill would expose the inconsistency in abortion rights.

I should end by summarizing the author's view that opposing the bill supports neglecting newborns, highlighting the moral conflict. 

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise manner while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that highlights Democrats' stance on abortion rights. The legislation mandates that doctors provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion, countering claims that such infants do not exist or that existing laws prevent infanticide. Democrats have opposed the bill, arguing it limits health-care options and misrepresenting its purpose as "anti-abortion." However, the bill does not regulate abortion access but simply requires treating born-alive infants the same as any other newborn. The author argues that opposing the bill implies support for neglecting infants who survive abortions, exposing the dehumanizing logic behind abortion rights. By blocking the bill, Democrats risk perpetuating the arbitrary denial of rights to newborns, while supporting it would challenge the pro-choice narrative. The legislation aims to ensure care for infants, countering claims of infanticide and highlighting the moral implications of abortion policies. END OF SUMMARY.
