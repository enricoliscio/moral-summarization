SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. This bill exposes the Democratic Party's commitment to unlimited legal abortion and their opposition to protecting newborns who survive abortions. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the legislation in response to comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam, suggesting that mothers and physicians could decide whether to let nearly aborted newborns die from lack of care. 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, and there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide care to infants who survive abortions. The Democrats' opposition to this bill reveals their dehumanizing rationale for abortion and their belief that denying medical care to newborns who were "targeted" for abortion is acceptable. This commonsense legislation will expose the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them only after birth.

END OF SUMMARY.
