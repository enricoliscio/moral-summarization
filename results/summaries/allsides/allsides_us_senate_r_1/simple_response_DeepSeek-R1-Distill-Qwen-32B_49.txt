Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the Senate considering a bill that requires medical care for infants born alive after an abortion. The author criticizes Democrats for opposing this bill, arguing it's about protecting newborns. They mention the lack of federal laws and the opposition's rationales, like denying the existence of born-alive infants or claiming existing laws prevent infanticide, which the author disputes. The article also highlights the moral dilemma, suggesting that supporting the bill would challenge the pro-choice stance by showing inconsistency in granting rights after birth.

I should focus on the key elements: the bill's purpose, the political opposition, the rationales given by Democrats, the lack of existing laws, and the moral argument about the inconsistency in rights before and after birth. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it reflects the author's moral perspective.

I'll start by stating the bill's aim, then mention the reintroduction by Senator Sasse and the Democratic opposition. Next, outline their reasons for opposing it, such as denying the existence of born-alive infants and claiming existing laws are sufficient, which the author argues isn't true. Then, discuss the moral argument about the inconsistency in rights. Finally, conclude with the bill's potential to expose the pro-choice rationale's issues.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise, making sure to highlight the moral framing without being biased beyond what's in the article.

SUMMARY:  
The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill requiring medical care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Introduced by Senator Ben Sasse, the legislation aims to ensure newborns receive the same care as any other child born alive. In 2019, 44 Democratic senators opposed the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants do not exist or that existing laws already prevent infanticide. However, evidence suggests infants do survive abortion procedures, and only 33 states have laws mandating care for such newborns. Critics argue the bill is "anti-abortion," but it does not regulate abortion access; it merely mandates care for surviving infants. The author asserts that opposing the bill reveals a dehumanizing rationale, as it implies the right to abortion includes the right to let a newborn die if they were intended to be aborted. The bill challenges the moral consistency of pro-choice arguments by highlighting the arbitrary distinction between fetal and newborn rights. END OF SUMMARY.
