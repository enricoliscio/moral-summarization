SUMMARY: The Senate is preparing to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which aims to protect infants born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide them with medical care. This bill exposes the Democratic Party's commitment to unlimited legal abortion and their opposition to protecting infants who survive abortions. Despite evidence that attempted abortions can result in living infants, Democrats claim that "born-alive" infants don't exist and oppose legislation to prevent infanticide. They argue that the bill is "anti-abortion," placing government between women and doctors, even though it merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortions with the same degree of care as any other infant. The opposition to this commonsense legislation reveals the dehumanizing and arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them only after birth. Democrats risk exposing the moral inconsistency of their support for unlimited abortion rights, while those who oppose the bill maintain that the right to abortion includes the right to let an infant die of neglect if they were intended to be aborted. END OF SUMMARY.
