Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant. They provided an article about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and want a summary. The instructions specify that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY.", and it shouldn't exceed 200 words.

First, I need to understand the article. It's about a bill in the Senate that requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. The bill was reintroduced by Senator Ben Sasse in 2019, following comments from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. The article mentions that 44 Democrats voted against the bill, arguing that such infants don't exist, that existing laws prevent infanticide, or that the bill is anti-abortion.

I should identify the key points: the bill's purpose, the context of its reintroduction, Democratic opposition, their arguments, and the implications of supporting or opposing the bill. I need to condense this into a concise summary without exceeding 200 words.

I should also ensure that the summary captures the essence of the debate, highlighting the Democrats' rationales and the bill's implications on abortion rights. It's important to mention the lack of federal law and the state-level variations in protections.

I'll structure the summary by first introducing the bill, then the context, followed by the Democratic opposition and their arguments, and finally the implications of the debate. I'll make sure to stay within the word limit and use clear, concise language.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. I'll also ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content without adding any personal opinions or extra information.

Finally, I'll review the summary to confirm it meets all the user's requirements and effectively condenses the article.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill requiring doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the legislation in 2019 following Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's controversial comments about allowing nearly aborted newborns to die. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants don't exist, that existing laws prevent infanticide, or that the bill is "anti-abortion." However, evidence shows that infants do survive abortion procedures, and only 33 states have laws requiring medical care for such newborns. The bill does not regulate abortion access but mandates that surviving infants receive the same care as any other newborn. Opponents claim it interferes with women's health decisions, while supporters argue it exposes the dehumanizing logic behind abortion rights. The debate highlights the moral dilemma of denying rights to a fetus but granting them immediately after birth. END OF SUMMARY.
