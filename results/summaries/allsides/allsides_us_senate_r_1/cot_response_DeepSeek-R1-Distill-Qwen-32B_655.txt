Okay, so I've got this query where the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the morally framed words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about the Senate considering a bill called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The article is critical of Democrats, accusing them of supporting unlimited abortion rights, even when infants survive abortions. The author uses strong language to frame the issue morally.

For STEP 1, I need to extract all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "exposes," "commitment," "logic," "unlimited," "dehumanizing," "pro-choice," "anti-abortion," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny,"
