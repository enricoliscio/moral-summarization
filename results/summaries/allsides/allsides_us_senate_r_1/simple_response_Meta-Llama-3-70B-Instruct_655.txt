SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have consistently opposed this legislation, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist, and that laws already prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, as evidence shows that infants do survive late-term abortions, and only 33 states have laws requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to these infants. Democrats' opposition to this bill exposes their commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion, which dehumanizes the value of human life. By voting against this bill, lawmakers are essentially saying that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This moral stance is arbitrary and dehumanizing, and highlights the flaws in the pro-choice argument.

END OF SUMMARY.
