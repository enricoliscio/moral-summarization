Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Senate considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It's presented as exposing Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced it in 2019 after Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's comments about letting nearly aborted newborns die. In 2020, 44 Democratic senators voted against the bill. The article criticizes Democrats for their opposition, arguing they don't acknowledge that "born-alive" infants exist and that existing laws don't cover this adequately. It also points out that only 33 states have such laws, and New York repealed theirs. The article accuses Democrats of mislabeling the bill as "anti-abortion" and claims the bill doesn't restrict abortion access but just requires care for surviving infants. It suggests that opposing the bill implies that abortion rights include letting newborns die, highlighting a dehumanizing rationale.

Now, I need to create a concise summary that includes these points, keeping the moral framing intact. I should mention the bill, the senators' opposition, the arguments against it, and the moral implications. I'll aim for under 200 words, starting after the "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by first introducing the bill and its purpose, then the political context with Sasse and Northam. Next, outline the Democratic opposition and their rationales, followed by the counterarguments presented in the article. Finally, address the moral stance and the implications of opposing the bill.

I should ensure that the summary reflects the author's perspective, which is critical of the Democratic stance and highlights the moral issues involved.

SUMMARY: The Senate is considering the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which mandates medical care for infants born alive after an abortion. Introduced by Senator Ben Sasse, the bill aims to address concerns raised by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's controversial comments on newborns' care. In 2020, 44 Democratic senators opposed the bill, arguing that "born-alive" infants don't exist or that existing laws suffice. However, evidence shows infants do survive abortions, and only 33 states have relevant laws, with New York repealing its protections. Critics argue the bill doesn't restrict abortion access but ensures newborns receive care. Opponents, however, claim it's "anti-abortion," though the bill focuses solely on post-abortion care. The article highlights a moral dilemma: supporting the bill risks exposing the inconsistency in denying rights to fetuses versus newborns, while opposing it implies abortion rights include letting newborns die. END OF SUMMARY.
