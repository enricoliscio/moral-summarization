SUMMARY:

The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, reintroduced by Senator Ben Sasse, requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Despite Democrats' claims, evidence shows that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures, and there is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to these infants. Only 33 states have such laws in place. Democrats' opposition to the bill exposes their commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion, suggesting that the right to abortion includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This dehumanizing rationale is morally reprehensible, as it arbitrarily denies rights to a human being based on their location inside or outside the womb. Lawmakers who oppose this bill are essentially condoning infanticide, highlighting the moral bankruptcy of the pro-choice argument. END OF SUMMARY.
