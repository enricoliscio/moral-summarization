Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Let me read through it again to understand the key points.

The author is critical of Democrats, accusing them of supporting unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced it, and Democrats opposed it, voting to block it. They claim that 'born-alive' infants don't exist, but the author counters with examples like Kermit Gosnell and data showing infants do survive. Democrats also argue that existing laws prevent infanticide, but the author says there's no federal law requiring care for these infants.

The author uses strong moral terms like "require," "care," "die," "murderous," "infanticide," "false," "repealed," "opposition," etc. I need to make sure the summary includes these words as much as possible.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral conflict. Start by introducing the bill and its purpose. Then mention the Democrats' opposition and their rationales, pointing out the flaws in their arguments. Emphasize the moral implications, like dehumanization and the right to care versus abortion rights.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the key morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes all the necessary elements while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that highlights Democrats' support for unlimited legal abortion. The legislation requires doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Senator Ben Sasse reintroduced the bill in 2019 after Virginia Governor Ralph Northam suggested that nearly aborted newborns could be left to die in some cases. Last year, 44 Democratic senators voted to block the bill, claiming "born-alive" infants don't exist and that existing laws prevent infanticide. However, evidence shows infants do survive abortion procedures, and only 33 states have laws requiring care for such newborns. Democrats also argue the bill is "anti-abortion," but it doesn't regulate abortion access; it merely requires treating born-alive infants like any other newborn. Critics argue opposing the bill implies the right to abortion includes the right to deny care to a newborn who was targeted for abortion. The bill exposes the dehumanizing logic behind abortion rights, as pro-choice lawmakers risk revealing the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a fetus and granting them to a newborn. Lawmakers opposing the bill effectively support letting an infant die of neglect if they were intended to be killed moments earlier. END OF SUMMARY.
