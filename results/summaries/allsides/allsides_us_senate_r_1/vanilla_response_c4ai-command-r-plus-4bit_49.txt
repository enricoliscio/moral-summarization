SUMMARY: The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which aims to protect infants born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide them with medical care. The bill was reintroduced by Senator Ben Sasse in response to comments made by Virginia governor Ralph Northam, suggesting that nearly aborted newborns could be left to die. Despite opposition from Democrats, who claim that "born-alive" infants do not exist and that existing laws already prevent infanticide, the bill aims to expose the dehumanizing rationale at the heart of the argument for abortion. The legislation does not regulate abortion access but ensures that newborns who survive abortion receive the same medical care as any other infant. The bill highlights a crucial question: does the right to abortion include the right to deny medical care to a newborn who was intended to be aborted?
END OF SUMMARY.
