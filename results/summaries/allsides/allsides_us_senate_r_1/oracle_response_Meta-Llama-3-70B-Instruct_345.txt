SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which exposes Democrats' commitment to unlimited legal abortion. The bill requires doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Despite Democrats' flimsy rationales, the legislation aims to ensure that newborns receive the same degree of care as any other child born alive at the same gestational age. Democrats claim that "born-alive" infants don't exist, but evidence suggests that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures. They also argue that laws already exist to prevent infanticide, which is false, as only 33 states have such laws in place. By voting against the bill, Democrats are essentially supporting the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion, a dehumanizing rationale. The bill doesn't regulate abortion, but rather requires doctors to treat newborns with care, not neglect. Democrats' opposition reveals their commitment to an unlimited right to abortion, even if it means allowing infants to die from lack of care.

END OF SUMMARY.
