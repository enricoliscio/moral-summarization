SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Democrats have consistently opposed the bill, claiming that "born-alive" infants don't exist, and that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. However, these claims are false, and the bill merely requires doctors to treat newborns who survive abortion with the same care as any other newborn infant. Democrats' opposition exposes their commitment to the logic of unlimited legal abortion, which includes the right to deny medical care to a newborn infant who was targeted for abortion. This dehumanizing rationale is morally reprehensible, and lawmakers who oppose the bill are essentially supporting the right to let an infant die of neglect if they were planned to have been killed a second before. The bill's passage would require Democrats to confront the arbitrary nature of denying rights to a human being inside the womb and granting them rights the instant after birth. END OF SUMMARY.
