SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a court battle between Congress and the administration. Mnuchin missed the final deadline, pledging to make a final decision by May 6. This was the second time the administration had missed a deadline for the tax returns. Mnuchin claimed he was consulting with the Justice Department and that the request was "unprecedented." Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition." The White House indicated that Trump was unlikely to hand over his tax returns, with spokesman Hogan Gidley saying the president was "not inclined to do so at this time." Democrats plan to consult counsel about their next steps, and legal experts say administration officials risk contempt of Congress and possible legal repercussions for defying the committee's request. Mnuchin's failure to comply with the deadline has been seen as a violation of the law and an attempt to keep Trump's records hidden.
END OF SUMMARY.
