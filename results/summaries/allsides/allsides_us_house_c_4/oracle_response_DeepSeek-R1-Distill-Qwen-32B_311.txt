Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to focus on the morally charged words used by the author. Let me read through the article again to identify those words and the key points.

The article is about the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, missing a deadline to provide President Trump's tax returns to Congress. The author uses words like "failed," "missed," "lapse," "ignored," and "violate," which carry moral implications. The main conflict is between Congress and the administration, with Democrats pushing for transparency and Republicans opposing it as a political move.

I should start by highlighting Mnuchin's failure to meet the deadline. Then, mention the possible legal battle and the moral stance of both parties. I need to include terms like "consult," "consistent with the law," "furnish," and "contempt." Also, the Democrats' frustration and their intention to subpoena the records is important.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, ensuring that the moral framing is clear. I'll structure it to show the administration's actions as failing to comply, the Democrats' determination, and the potential consequences like contempt or legal action. I'll make sure to include key names and the significance of the legal battle possibly reaching the Supreme Court.

Let me draft this, making sure to include all the necessary morally framed words without making it too lengthy. I need to balance the summary with the moral perspective, showing the conflict and the stakes involved.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump’s tax returns, setting the stage for a potential legal battle. The deadline lapsed without the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or Treasury furnishing the requested documents, prompting House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to threaten a subpoena. Mnuchin stated he was still consulting with the Justice Department to determine if the request was consistent with the law, delaying a final decision until May 6. Democrats argue that Trump’s tax returns are necessary to investigate potential conflicts of interest, while Republicans condemn the request as a political "fishing expedition." Trump has consistently refused to release his tax returns, citing an audit, though his former lawyer Michael Cohen claimed no audit was ongoing. Democrats accuse the administration of violating the law and defying congressional oversight, with some warning of contempt charges and legal action if the IRS fails to comply. The situation highlights a clash over the rule of law and accountability, with Democrats vowing to pursue a legal crusade to obtain the records, potentially leading to a Supreme Court showdown. END OF SUMMARY.
