SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, defying a legal obligation to do so. This sets the stage for a potential court battle between Congress and the administration. Mnuchin has pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6, but Democrats are already consulting with counsel about their next steps.

The request for Trump's tax returns is part of Democratic investigations into possible conflicts of interest posed by his extensive business interests, which he has not divested despite serving as president. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, claiming he cannot do so while under audit, a claim disputed by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to hand over his tax returns, despite the legal requirement to do so. Democrats are confident they will succeed in any legal battle over the returns, but the effort is expected to result in a lengthy court battle that may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. Mnuchin's defiance of the congressional subpoena raises serious ethical concerns about the administration's commitment to transparency and the rule of law.
END OF SUMMARY.
