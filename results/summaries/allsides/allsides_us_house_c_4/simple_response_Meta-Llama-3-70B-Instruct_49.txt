SUMMARY:

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle. This move is seen as a blatant disregard for the rule of law, with Democrats accusing the administration of hiding Trump's records to conceal potential conflicts of interest. Mnuchin claims he is still consulting with the Justice Department, but Democrats argue that the law is clear and he must comply with the request. The administration's actions are widely seen as a political maneuver to protect Trump's interests, with Republicans condemning the request as a "fishing expedition". Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight, with some even suggesting that administration officials could face financial penalties and jail time for defying the committee.

END OF SUMMARY.
