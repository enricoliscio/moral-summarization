Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failing to meet a deadline for providing President Trump's tax returns. The user wants the summary to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and formatted with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main events are that Mnuchin didn't meet the deadline, which sets up a possible court battle. The House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal is involved, and he's likely to subpoena the records. The administration has missed deadlines before, and Mnuchin is consulting the Justice Department. Democrats want the tax returns for possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans see it as a political move. Trump hasn't released his returns since 2016, citing audits, but his lawyer said they weren't under audit. The White House says Trump isn't inclined to release them now. There's a legal angle where Democrats might hold officials in contempt if they ignore a subpoena, leading to a lawsuit. Neal is the only authorized lawmaker to request the records. Democrats are confident they'll win in court, but it's likely to go to the Supreme Court.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by stating Mnuchin missed the deadline, prompting a legal battle. Mention Neal's next steps, the administration's stance, the reasons behind the request, and the potential legal actions. Keep it under 200 words, focusing on the main events and implications without too much detail.

I should make sure the summary is clear and includes all critical elements: who, what, when, where, why, and the potential consequences. I'll avoid jargon and keep it straightforward.

Let me structure it: Start with the deadline miss, then Neal's response, the administration's reasoning, the political divide, Trump's stance, the legal process, and the Democrats' confidence in the outcome.

I'll make sure each sentence is concise and flows logically. Check the word count as I go to stay within limits.

Finally, I'll format it correctly with the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline for the IRS and Treasury to submit Trump's tax records, but the deadline passed without the documents being delivered. Mnuchin informed Neal that a final decision on releasing the records would be made by May 6. This is the second missed deadline since Neal requested the records in April. Democrats seek the returns to investigate potential conflicts of interest due to Trump's business dealings, while Republicans criticize the request as a political "fishing expedition." Trump has not released his tax returns since 2016, citing audits, though his lawyer Michael Cohen claimed no audit was ongoing. The White House stated Trump is unlikely to hand over the records. Democrats argue the law requires the Treasury secretary to provide taxpayer data upon request and could pursue legal action if the administration defies a subpoena. The situation could ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
