SUMMARY:

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet a final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle. Mnuchin's decision to miss the deadline has prompted House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to consider subpoenaing Trump's tax records, which could lead to a legal fight that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. Mnuchin has chosen to violate the law by refusing to furnish the requested documents, citing an ongoing consultation with the Justice Department. This failure to comply with the deadline has been viewed as a denial, and legal experts warn that administration officials risk financial penalties and even jail time by defying the committee. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight, accusing the administration of contempt for the rule of law and hiding Trump's records.

END OF SUMMARY.
