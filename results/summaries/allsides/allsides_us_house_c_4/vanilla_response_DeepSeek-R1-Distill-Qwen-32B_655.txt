Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, missing a deadline to hand over President Trump's tax returns. Okay, that's the main event. 

I need to identify the key points. First, Mnuchin didn't meet the deadline set by Congress, which is the House Ways and Means Committee. The chairman, Richard Neal, set a 5 p.m. deadline, and it passed without the documents being provided. So, that's a crucial point.

Next, Mnuchin sent a letter promising a final decision by May 6. This isn't the first time they've missed a deadline, so that's important context. The Democrats are pushing for the tax returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans are opposing it, calling it a political move. 

Trump hasn't released his tax returns since 2016, citing an audit, but his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he doesn't think Trump is under audit. The White House is also against releasing them, saying Trump won't do it now but might after the audit. 

There's a legal angle here. The Democrats argue that the law requires the Treasury Secretary to provide the information, and they might subpoena the records. If the administration defies this, it could lead to contempt charges and a legal battle, possibly up to the Supreme Court. 

I should also note that Neal is the only authorized lawmaker to request taxpayer info. Democrats are confident they'll win in court, and they see this as a fight for oversight. 

Putting it all together, the summary should cover Mnuchin missing the deadline, the context of previous misses, the Democrats' reasons, Republican opposition, Trump's stance, the legal implications, and the potential for a court battle. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all essential points without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump’s tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline for the IRS and Treasury to submit six years of Trump’s tax records, but the deadline passed without the documents. Mnuchin responded with a letter, promising a final decision by May 6, marking the second missed deadline since Neal’s request in April. Democrats seek Trump’s returns to investigate potential conflicts of interest due to his business holdings, while Republicans criticize the move as a politically motivated “fishing expedition.” Trump has refused to release his tax returns since 2016, citing an audit, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed no audit was ongoing. The White House stated Trump is unlikely to hand over the records. Democrats argue the law mandates the Treasury Secretary to comply with Neal’s request, and failure to do so could lead to contempt charges and a court battle. The situation highlights a broader conflict over congressional oversight and the rule of law. END OF SUMMARY.
