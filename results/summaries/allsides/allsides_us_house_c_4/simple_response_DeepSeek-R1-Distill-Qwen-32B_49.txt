Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not meeting a deadline to hand over President Trump's tax returns to Congress. This sets up a potential court battle. Democrats want the returns to check for conflicts of interest, while Republicans see it as a political move. Trump hasn't released his taxes, citing an audit, but his lawyer said he wasn't under audit. The Democrats argue that the law requires the Treasury Secretary to provide the information, and they're ready for a legal fight.

Now, I need to identify the moral framing. The Democrats are portrayed as upholding the rule of law and accountability, emphasizing transparency and oversight. They're seen as fighting against corruption. On the other hand, the administration is depicted as violating the law and showing contempt for legal obligations, with possible penalties if they resist.

I should make sure the summary captures both sides' perspectives and the underlying moral arguments. It's important to highlight the legal and ethical implications without taking sides, just presenting the moral framing as the author did.

I'll structure the summary by first stating Mnuchin's failure to meet the deadline, then the context of the request, the reactions from both parties, and the potential legal consequences. I'll ensure it's concise, under 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral perspectives clearly.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a final deadline for the IRS and Treasury to submit six years of Trump's tax records, but the deadline passed without any action. Mnuchin responded by promising a "final decision" by May 6, marking the second missed deadline since Neal requested the records in April. Democrats argue the request is lawful and necessary to investigate potential conflicts of interest due to Trump's ongoing business interests, while Republicans condemn it as a politically motivated "fishing expedition." Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing an audit, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed no audit was ongoing. Democrats emphasize that the law mandates the Treasury Secretary to comply with such requests, framing the administration's inaction as contempt for the rule of law. Legal experts suggest House Democrats could pursue contempt charges and a federal lawsuit if the administration continues to resist, with potential penalties for non-compliance. The standoff highlights a clash between accountability and executive privilege, with Democrats vowing to fight for transparency. END OF SUMMARY.
