SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin missed a congressional deadline to hand over President Donald Trump's tax returns to the House Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Richard Neal. Mnuchin has until May 6 to make a final decision on the matter and has consulted with the Justice Department, citing the request as "unprecedented." Democrats seek Trump's tax records as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans condemn the request as a political move. The White House has indicated Trump is unlikely to release his returns while under audit, despite his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, disputing an ongoing audit. Democrats could vote to hold Mnuchin in contempt of Congress and sue in federal court to obtain the returns, with legal experts predicting a possible Supreme Court battle. Representative Judy Chu expects a legal battle to unfold if the IRS does not comply with a subpoena for the returns.
END OF SUMMARY.
