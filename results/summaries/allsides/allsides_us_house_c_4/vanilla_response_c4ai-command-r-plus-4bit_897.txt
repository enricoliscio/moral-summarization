SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin missed a congressional deadline to provide President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, escalating a standoff between Congress and the administration. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6, while House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said he would consult with counsel on next steps. Mnuchin cited ongoing consultations with the Justice Department and questioned the legality of Neal's request. Democrats seek Trump's tax records as part of their investigations into potential conflicts of interest, while Republicans call it a political maneuver. The White House indicated Trump was unlikely to release his returns, citing an ongoing audit. Democrats have threatened to hold Mnuchin in contempt and take legal action if necessary. The standoff sets the stage for a potential court battle over Trump's financial records.
END OF SUMMARY.
