SUMMARY:
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. This move is seen as a "corrupt" attempt to hide Trump's records, with Democrats accusing Mnuchin of "contempt" for the rule of law. Mnuchin claims the request is "unprecedented" and is consulting with the Justice Department to determine if it is consistent with the law. Democrats, on the other hand, are on a "crusade" to impose "plain" oversight on the administration, citing concerns over possible conflicts of interest posed by Trump's continued ownership of business interests. The outcome could lead to a legal battle that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
