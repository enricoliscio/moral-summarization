SUMMARY:
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. Mnuchin's decision has been termed "unprecedented" by Democrats, who want Trump's returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests. Republicans have "condemned" the request as a political "fishing expedition". Trump has "feared" that releasing his returns could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight, accusing Mnuchin of "contempt" for the rule of law and the administration of being "corrupt". The outcome could ultimately lead to a legal battle that may have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
