SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a potential court battle. Mnuchin missed two deadlines set by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, who is now consulting with counsel on his next steps. Mnuchin has pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6, citing the need for legal guidance from the Justice Department. Democrats are seeking Trump's tax records as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition." The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to hand over his returns, despite a law stating that the Treasury Secretary "shall furnish" taxpayer data upon request. Legal experts say House Democrats could hold Mnuchin in contempt of Congress and sue in federal court to obtain the returns. The administration's defiance of the committee's request could result in financial penalties and even jail time for officials involved. Democrats remain confident in their legal standing and are prepared to fight for transparency and oversight.
END OF SUMMARY.
