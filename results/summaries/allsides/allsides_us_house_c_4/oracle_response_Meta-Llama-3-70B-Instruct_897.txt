SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the final congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. Mnuchin's decision to miss the deadline has prompted House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to consider subpoenaing Trump's tax records, which could lead to a legal fight that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. Mnuchin has chosen to consult with the Justice Department, citing the request as "unprecedented" and claiming that the department cannot act upon the request unless it is determined to be consistent with the law. However, Democrats argue that Mnuchin is violating the law by refusing to furnish the tax records, and that the administration's contempt for the rule of law is without peer. If the IRS does not comply with the request, it is likely that Chairman Neal will subpoena the returns, leading to a legal battle to defend the right of oversight in Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
