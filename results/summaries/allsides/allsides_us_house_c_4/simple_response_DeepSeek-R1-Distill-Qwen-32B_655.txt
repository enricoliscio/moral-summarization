Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, ending with specific tokens. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Mnuchin missing the deadline for Trump's tax returns, the possible legal battle, and the moral implications from both sides. I should highlight the conflict between Congress and the administration, the legal aspects, and the political stances. I need to keep the summary concise but include key details like the deadlines, the subpoenas, and the arguments from Democrats and Republicans. Also, I should mention the potential consequences if the administration defies the subpoenas. I'll structure it to show the progression of events and the moral viewpoints presented by each side. Making sure to end with the tokens as specified.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline, which passed without the requested documents. Mnuchin responded with a letter promising a final decision by May 6, marking the second missed deadline since Neal's request in April. Democrats argue the returns are necessary to investigate possible conflicts of interest due to Trump's business holdings, while Republicans deem the request a political "fishing expedition." Trump has refused to release his returns, citing an ongoing audit, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed no audit was active. Democrats assert the law mandates the Treasury secretary to provide taxpayer data upon request, accusing the administration of defying the rule of law. Legal experts suggest House Democrats could hold Mnuchin or IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig in contempt if they ignore a subpoena, potentially leading to financial penalties or jail time. The situation underscores the administration's resistance to oversight, with Democrats vowing to pursue a legal fight, possibly culminating in the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
