SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle. Mnuchin missed the final deadline, pledging to make a decision by May 6. This was the second time the administration had missed a deadline for the tax returns, with Mnuchin claiming he was consulting with the Justice Department. Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest and have long acknowledged that their efforts could result in a legal battle. Despite the clear law, Mnuchin is choosing to violate it and keep Trump's records hidden. Mnuchin's failure to comply with the request could result in him being held in contempt of Congress and sued in federal court. The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to hand over his tax returns, which breaks with decades-old precedent.
END OF SUMMARY.
