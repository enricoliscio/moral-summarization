Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not meeting a deadline for providing President Trump's tax returns. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that Mnuchin failed to meet the final congressional deadline, which sets up a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. It mentions that the outcome was expected, and now House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal might subpoena Trump's tax records. The deadline was 5 p.m., and it passed without the documents being received. Mnuchin then sent a letter saying he'd make a final decision by May 6, which was the second missed deadline since April 3.

Democrats want the tax returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest because Trump still owns businesses. Republicans see this as a political move. Trump hasn't released his returns since 2016, citing audits, but his lawyer Cohen said he doesn't think they're under audit anymore. The White House says Trump won't hand them over now but might after the audit.

The article also notes that under the law, the Treasury Secretary must provide the data upon request, and failure to comply could lead to contempt charges and legal action. Neal is the only authorized lawmaker to request this info. Democrats are confident they'll win any legal battle, but it's likely to go to the Supreme Court.

So, the main points are: Mnuchin missed the deadline, leading to potential subpoenas and legal battles. Democrats are seeking the returns for oversight, while Republicans oppose it. Trump hasn't released them, citing audits, but Cohen's statement contradicts that. The legal implications include contempt and court battles, possibly ending at the Supreme Court.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key events and implications. I should mention the missed deadline, the possible subpoena, the political divide, Trump's refusal, and the legal consequences.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a potential legal battle. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline, which passed without the requested documents. Mnuchin responded by promising a final decision by May 6. This is the second missed deadline since Neal first requested the returns on April 3. Democrats seek the returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest due to Trump's business dealings, while Republicans oppose the move as a political "fishing expedition." Trump has not released his tax returns since 2016, citing ongoing audits, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, stated he believes they are not under audit. The White House indicated Trump is unlikely to provide the returns now. Under federal law, the Treasury Secretary must comply with Neal's request, and failure to do so could lead to contempt charges and legal action. Democrats are confident they will prevail in any legal challenge, which could ultimately reach the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
