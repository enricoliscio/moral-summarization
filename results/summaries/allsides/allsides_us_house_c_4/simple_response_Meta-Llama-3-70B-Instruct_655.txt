SUMMARY:

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet a congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. This move is seen as a violation of the law and a contempt for the rule of law. Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of business interests while serving as president. Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition". Mnuchin has pledged to make a "final decision" on whether to provide Trump's tax records by May 6. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump's tax returns, citing a law that says the Treasury secretary "shall furnish" taxpayer data upon request from an authorized lawmaker.

END OF SUMMARY.
