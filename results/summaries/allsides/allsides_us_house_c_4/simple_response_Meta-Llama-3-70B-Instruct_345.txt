SUMMARY:

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the deadline to provide President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress, setting the stage for a potential court battle. This move is seen as a violation of the law and a contempt for the rule of law. Democrats have been seeking Trump's tax returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of business interests while serving as president. Mnuchin has claimed that the request is "unprecedented" and that he is still consulting with the Justice Department. However, Democrats argue that the law is clear and that Mnuchin is obligated to provide the tax returns. The failure to comply with the deadline may lead to a subpoena and ultimately, a legal battle that could end up in the Supreme Court. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight, citing the clarity of the law.

END OF SUMMARY.
