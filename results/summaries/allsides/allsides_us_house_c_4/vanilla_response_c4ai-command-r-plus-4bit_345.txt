SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline to deliver President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress, setting the stage for a potential court battle. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6. The request for Trump's tax records was made by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, who wants to investigate possible conflicts of interest posed by Trump's business interests. Mnuchin has called the request "unprecedented" and is consulting with the Justice Department. Democrats have threatened to hold Mnuchin in contempt of Congress if he ignores a subpoena, and legal experts predict a lengthy legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court. The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to release his tax returns, claiming that he will consider doing so only when he is out of audit. Democrats argue that the decision is not up to the president and that the law clearly states that the Treasury Secretary "shall furnish" taxpayer data upon request. The outcome of this dispute remains uncertain, but it highlights the ongoing tensions between Congress and the Trump administration over transparency and oversight.
