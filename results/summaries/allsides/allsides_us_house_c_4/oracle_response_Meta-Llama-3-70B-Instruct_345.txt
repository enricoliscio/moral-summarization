SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. Mnuchin's decision to miss the deadline has sparked outrage, with Democrats accusing him of choosing to violate the law to keep Trump's records hidden away. The Treasury Secretary claimed he was still consulting with the Justice Department about the request, which he termed "unprecedented." However, Democrats argue that the law is clear and that Mnuchin is defying the rule of law by refusing to furnish the documents. If Mnuchin continues to ignore the subpoena, he risks financial penalties and even jail time. The Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump's tax returns, with Representative Bill Pascrell stating that the administration's contempt for the rule of law is "without peer."
