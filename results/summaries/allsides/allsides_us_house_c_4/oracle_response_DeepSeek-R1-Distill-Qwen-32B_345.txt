Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words used by the author. My task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Steven Mnuchin missing a deadline to provide Trump's tax returns, leading to potential legal battles. The key players are Mnuchin, Richard Neal, and the Democrats vs. Republicans. The moral framing is evident in words like "failed," "contempt," "violate," etc.

I need to ensure the summary captures the conflict, the missed deadlines, and the legal implications. I should include the morally framed words without making it sound forced. I'll structure the summary to mention the failure to meet deadlines, the potential for contempt, and the legal actions being considered.

I'll start by stating Mnuchin failed to meet the deadline, then mention Neal's response and the possibility of a subpoena. I'll note the administration's stance and the Democrats' accusations. I'll also include the legal risks and the ongoing battle. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it straightforward, ending with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump’s tax returns, setting the stage for a potential legal battle. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal had set a 5 p.m. deadline for the IRS and Treasury to provide six years of Trump’s tax records, but the deadline lapsed without the documents being received. Mnuchin, in a letter to Neal, pledged to make a "final decision" by May 6, marking the second time the administration had missed a House deadline. Democrats, seeking the returns as part of their investigation into possible conflicts of interest, accused the administration of defying the law and hiding Trump’s records. Republicans, however, condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition." Mnuchin stated that the Justice Department was still consulting on whether the request was consistent with the law. Neal warned that failure to comply would be viewed as a denial, and legal experts suggested that Democrats could vote to hold administration officials in contempt of Congress if they ignored a subpoena. The situation highlights the administration’s contempt for the rule of law and its refusal to comply with congressional oversight. END OF SUMMARY.
