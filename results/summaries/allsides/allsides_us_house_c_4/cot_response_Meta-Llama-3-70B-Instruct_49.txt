SUMMARY:
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. This move is seen as a "contempt" for the rule of law, with Democrats accusing the administration of hiding Trump's records. Mnuchin has pledged to make a "final decision" on whether to provide Trump's tax records by May 6, citing the need to consult with the Justice Department. Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations into possible "conflicts of interest" posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests. Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition". The outcome could ultimately lead to a legal fight that may end up with the U.S. Supreme Court, with Democrats confident of succeeding in their "crusade" to impose "oversight" on the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
