SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline to hand over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, defying a legal obligation to do so and setting the stage for a potential court battle. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6, despite it being the second time the administration has missed a deadline. Democrats are seeking Trump's tax records as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, but Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition." The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to voluntarily release his returns, with spokesman Hogan Gidley stating that the decision is "not up to the president." Democrats have emphasized that the law clearly states that the Treasury Secretary "shall furnish" taxpayer data upon request and that failure to comply could result in contempt of Congress charges and legal action. The outcome of this dispute remains uncertain, but it highlights the ongoing ethical concerns surrounding Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, breaking decades-old precedents and raising questions about transparency and accountability in government.
END OF SUMMARY.
