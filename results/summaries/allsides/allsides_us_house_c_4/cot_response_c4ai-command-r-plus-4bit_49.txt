SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet the final deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress, setting the stage for a possible legal fight. Mnuchin missed the deadline set by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, who has requested Trump's tax records as part of an investigation into potential conflicts of interest. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision by May 6, but his refusal to meet the deadline was widely condemned by Democrats as a violation of the law. They accused the administration of being corrupt and expressed their determination to impose oversight. The issue of Trump's tax returns has been a contentious one, with the president breaking decades-old precedents by refusing to release them during his candidacy and presidency. Republicans have condemned the request as a political fishing expedition, while Democrats see it as a crusade to uphold the rule of law and their right to oversight. The outcome of this matter now appears to be settled for a legal battle, with the possibility of subpoenas and contempt charges on the horizon.
END OF SUMMARY.
