SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle. Mnuchin missed the deadline, which was set by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, and pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6. Neal had informed the IRS that failure to comply with the deadline would be viewed as a denial, and legal experts say that Mnuchin risks being held in contempt of Congress if he continues to ignore the request. Democrats want Trump's tax returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, and they believe they will succeed in any legal battle over the matter. Mnuchin has termed the request "unprecedented" and said he is consulting with the Justice Department to determine if it is consistent with the law. The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to hand over his tax returns, which he has refused to release since becoming president. This failure to comply with the request may result in a subpoena and a legal battle that could ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court.
END OF SUMMARY.
