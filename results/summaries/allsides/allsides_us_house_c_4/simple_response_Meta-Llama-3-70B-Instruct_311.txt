SUMMARY:

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle. This move is seen as a violation of the law and a contempt for the rule of law by the administration. Democrats have been seeking Trump's tax returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of business interests while serving as president. Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition". Mnuchin has pledged to make a final decision on whether to provide Trump's tax records by May 6, but Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump's tax returns. The outcome may ultimately have to be settled by the US Supreme Court. This development raises concerns about the administration's disregard for the law and its efforts to hide Trump's records from public scrutiny.

END OF SUMMARY.
