SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a deadline to hand over President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress, defying a legal request from House lawmakers. The missed deadline sets the stage for a potential court battle between Congress and the Trump administration. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6, but Democrats have condemned his inaction as a violation of the law and an attempt to hide Trump's financial dealings. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, who made the request for Trump's returns, is considering his next steps, which could include issuing a subpoena. Mnuchin has claimed he is consulting with the Justice Department due to the "unprecedented" nature of the request, despite Democrats arguing that their efforts are consistent with federal law. The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to voluntarily release his tax returns, which breaks with longstanding precedent. This situation highlights the ongoing power struggle between Congress and the executive branch, with Democrats seeking to impose oversight and the Trump administration defying their requests. Mnuchin's failure to comply with the deadline may result in contempt of Congress charges and potential legal consequences for administration officials.
