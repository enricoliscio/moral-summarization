SUMMARY: Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a deadline to turn over Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a court battle. Mnuchin missed a second deadline, prompting House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to threaten subpoenas as an opening salvo in a legal fight. Mnuchin refused to meet the final deadline and pledged to make a final decision by May 6. Republicans condemned the request as a political fishing expedition, while Trump continued refusing to release his returns, breaking decades-old precedent. The White House deemed it "not up to the president," and Mnuchin informed Neal that failure to comply would be viewed as denial. Legal experts warned of contempt of Congress charges for ignoring subpoenas, with Democrats confident of succeeding in any legal battle over Trump's returns. Despite the law's clarity, Democrats acknowledged the request could result in a legal battle, with Mnuchin again choosing to violate the law and keep records hidden away from what they deemed a corrupt administration. END OF SUMMARY.
