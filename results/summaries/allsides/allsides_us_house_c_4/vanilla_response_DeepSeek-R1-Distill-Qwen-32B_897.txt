Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, not meeting a congressional deadline to hand over President Trump's tax returns. Hmm, that's a key point.

The article mentions that this sets the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. So, the main issue is the delay in providing Trump's tax records, leading to potential legal action.

It also talks about the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Richard Neal, setting a deadline which passed without the documents being provided. Mnuchin then sent a letter promising a final decision by May 6. This is the second time the administration missed a deadline. 

Democrats want the tax returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest due to Trump's business dealings. Republicans, on the other hand, see this as a political move by Democrats. Trump hasn't released his returns, citing an audit, but his lawyer said he wasn't under audit. 

The White House says Trump isn't inclined to release them now. There's a law stating the Treasury Secretary must provide taxpayer data upon request. If the administration defies the subpoena, Democrats might hold them in contempt and sue, potentially leading to Supreme Court involvement.

So, the summary needs to capture the key points: Mnuchin missing the deadline, the possible court battle, Democrats' investigation, Republicans' criticism, Trump's refusal, and the legal implications.

I should structure it concisely, making sure each point is clear and within 200 words. Let me make sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline, which passed without the requested documents. Mnuchin promised a final decision by May 6, marking the second missed deadline since Neal requested the records in April. Democrats seek Trump's returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest due to his business dealings, while Republicans criticize the request as a political "fishing expedition." Trump has not released his returns, citing an audit, though his lawyer Michael Cohen claimed no audit was ongoing. The White House stated Trump is unlikely to comply. Democrats argue the law mandates the Treasury Secretary to provide taxpayer data upon request, and failure to comply could lead to contempt charges and legal action, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
