SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin missed a congressional deadline to provide President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, escalating a standoff with House Democrats seeking to investigate the president's finances. The deadline passed without the House Ways and Means Committee receiving the documents, and Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision by May 6. Mnuchin cited ongoing consultations with the Justice Department and questioned the legality of the request, which he called "unprecedented." Democrats seek Trump's returns as part of their probes into potential conflicts of interest, while Republicans denounce the request as a political move. The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to release his returns while under audit, although legal experts say the request is lawful and House Democrats may pursue legal action to obtain the documents. The dispute sets the stage for a potential court battle, with Democrats confident of their legal standing and Mnuchin facing potential consequences for non-compliance.
END OF SUMMARY.
