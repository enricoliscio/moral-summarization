Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, failing to meet a deadline for providing President Trump's tax returns. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave, so I need to make sure I capture the perspectives from both sides.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It seems that Mnuchin missed the deadline set by the House Ways and Means Committee, which was led by Chairman Richard Neal. This sets up a potential court battle. The Democrats are pushing for the tax returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans are opposing this, calling it a political move.

The article mentions that Trump hasn't released his tax returns since 2016, breaking a precedent. He claims he can't because his taxes are under audit, but his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said that wasn't the case. The White House is also against releasing the returns, saying it's up to Trump once the audit is done.

Democrats argue that the law requires the Treasury Secretary to provide the information upon request, and they're ready to take legal action if necessary. They see this as a matter of oversight and the rule of law. Republicans, on the other hand, view it as a political "fishing expedition."

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: Mnuchin missing the deadline, the potential legal battle, the Democrats' reasons for wanting the returns, the Republicans' opposition, Trump's stance, and the legal implications if the administration defies the subpoenas.

I should structure the summary to first state that Mnuchin missed the deadline, then explain the implications, followed by the reasons from both parties, and end with the potential legal consequences. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring the moral framing is preserved, meaning highlighting the conflict between upholding the law and political motives.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these points concisely.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline for providing President Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal set a final deadline, which passed without the IRS delivering the requested records. Mnuchin stated the administration is still consulting with the Justice Department and promised a decision by May 6. Democrats seek Trump's returns to investigate conflicts of interest, while Republicans criticize the request as a political "fishing expedition." Trump has not released his tax returns, citing an audit, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed no audit was ongoing. Democrats argue the law mandates the Treasury Secretary to comply, threatening legal action if the administration defies subpoenas. The standoff highlights a clash between upholding the rule of law and accusations of political motives. END OF SUMMARY.
