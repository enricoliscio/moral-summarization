Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Trump's tax returns. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Steven Mnuchin missed a deadline set by Congress to hand over Trump's tax returns. This sets up a potential court battle. The House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Richard Neal, set a 5 pm deadline, but Mnuchin didn't meet it. Instead, he sent a letter saying they'd make a final decision by May 6. This is the second time they've missed a deadline since April 3.

Democrats are pushing for the returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest with Trump's businesses. Republicans are against it, calling it a political move. Trump hasn't released his tax returns, breaking a precedent, citing an audit. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he didn't think Trump was under audit, but Trump fears releasing returns might lead to penalties.

The White House says Trump isn't inclined to release them now. Democrats argue the law requires the Treasury Secretary to comply, and they might hold Mnuchin or Rettig in contempt if they ignore a subpoena. Legal experts say this could lead to a Supreme Court case, with possible penalties for those defying Congress.

Neal is the only authorized lawmaker to request taxpayer info. Democrats are confident they'll win any legal battle, emphasizing the administration's contempt for the rule of law.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Mnuchin missed the deadline, the implications, the reasons from both parties, Trump's stance, and the potential legal steps. I'll make sure to include the key players and the possible outcomes.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline, which passed without the IRS or Treasury delivering the requested records. Mnuchin responded with a letter, stating the administration would make a final decision by May 6. This marks the second missed deadline since Neal first requested the records in April. Democrats seek Trump's returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans criticize the move as a politically motivated "fishing expedition." Trump has not released his tax returns, citing an ongoing audit, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed no audit was active. Democrats argue the law mandates compliance, and failure to do so could lead to contempt of Congress charges and a legal fight, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. Neal emphasized he did not request the returns on behalf of the president, and Democrats expressed confidence in their legal stance. END OF SUMMARY.
