Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these moral terms as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "deadline," "fail," "refuse," "contempt," "violate," "corrupt," "fishing expedition," "unprecedented," "audits," "penalties," "contempt," "transparency," "accountability," "oversight," "rule of law," "precedent," "conflicts of interest," "abuse," "transgression," "integrity," "obstruction," and "transparency" stand out as they imply judgment or moral implications.

Next, I'll structure the summary. I need to highlight the key points: Mnuchin missing the deadline, the potential legal battle, the Democrats' push for transparency, the Republicans' criticism, Trump's refusal to release returns, and the possible consequences. I'll make sure to include the moral terms identified to maintain the author's framing.

I should ensure the summary is clear and concise, not exceeding 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Mnuchin's failure to meet the deadline, then the implications for a court battle. I'll note the Democrats' stance on accountability and Republicans' accusations. I'll include Trump's refusal and the legal implications for the administration. Finally, I'll conclude with the Democrats' confidence in their legal fight and the potential for a Supreme Court decision.

I need to make sure each point flows logically and that all key moral elements are included without making the summary too lengthy. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it straightforward, focusing on the conflict and the moral stakes involved.

**SUMMARY:**  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump’s tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. Democrats, seeking transparency and accountability, argue that Trump’s continued ownership of business interests poses conflicts of interest. Republicans, however, criticize the request as a politically motivated “fishing expedition.” Trump has defied decades-old precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, citing ongoing audits. However, his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed Trump’s taxes were not under audit. Mnuchin stated the administration was still consulting the Justice Department and would make a final decision by May 6. Democrats, asserting their legal authority, warn of contempt charges and a court fight if the administration defies subpoenas. They accuse the administration of violating the law and undermining the rule of law, calling its actions unprecedented and corrupt. The situation highlights a clash over presidential transparency and congressional oversight, with the legal battle likely heading to the Supreme Court.
