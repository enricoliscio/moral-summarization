SUMMARY:

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet a congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle. Mnuchin released a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, pledging to make a final decision on whether to provide Trump's tax records by May 6. Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition". Trump broke with precedent by refusing to release his tax returns as a presidential candidate or since being elected. Legal experts say House Democrats could vote to hold Mnuchin in contempt of Congress if they ignored a subpoena, and administration officials could ultimately risk financial penalties and even jail time by defying the committee.

END OF SUMMARY.
