SUMMARY:
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. This move is seen as a "contempt" for the rule of law, with Democrats accusing Mnuchin of choosing to "violate the law" to keep Trump's records hidden. Mnuchin has pledged to make a "final decision" on whether to provide Trump's tax records by May 6, citing the need to consult with the Justice Department. Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations of possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests. Republicans have "condemned" the request as a political "fishing expedition". The outcome could ultimately lead to a legal battle that may end up with the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight, with Representative Bill Pascrell calling the administration "corrupt" and vowing to continue the "crusade" to impose oversight.
END OF SUMMARY.
