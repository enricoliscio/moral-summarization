SUMMARY:

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet a congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. This move is seen as a blatant disregard for the rule of law, with Democrats accusing the administration of hiding Trump's records to conceal possible conflicts of interest. Mnuchin claims he is still consulting with the Justice Department, but Democrats argue that the law is clear and he is obligated to provide the tax records. The administration's actions are being seen as a "fishing expedition" to avoid accountability. The outcome could lead to a subpoena, contempt of Congress, and even financial penalties and jail time for administration officials. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight, citing the clarity of the law. This is a clear case of the administration putting its own interests above the law and accountability.

END OF SUMMARY.
