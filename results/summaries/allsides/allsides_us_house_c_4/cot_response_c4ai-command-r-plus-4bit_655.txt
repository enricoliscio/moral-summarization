SUMMARY:
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, failed to meet a deadline to provide President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress, prompting a potential court battle. Mnuchin missed two deadlines, pledging to make a final decision by May 6. House Democrats view this failure as a refusal and are considering their next steps, including possible contempt charges. The Treasury Secretary's action is seen as a violation of the law and a contempt of Congress. Democrats are confident of succeeding in a legal fight, with some calling it a crusade against a corrupt administration. Republicans have condemned the request as a political fishing expedition. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking decades-old precedents, and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has cast doubt on the president's claim that his taxes are under audit. The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to hand over his tax returns, further displaying contempt for the rule of law. Democrats are determined to impose oversight and hold the administration accountable. The situation sets the stage for a legal battle that could end up in the Supreme Court, with experts predicting possible financial penalties and jail time for defiant administration officials.
