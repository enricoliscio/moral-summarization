SUMMARY:

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet a final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle. Mnuchin's decision to miss the deadline has prompted House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to consider subpoenaing Trump's tax records, which could lead to a legal fight that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. Mnuchin claimed he was still consulting with the Justice Department about Neal's request, which he termed "unprecedented" and said the department cannot act upon the request unless it is determined to be consistent with the law. Democrats argue that Trump's tax returns are necessary to investigate possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition". Mnuchin's failure to comply with the deadline may be viewed as a denial, and legal experts say he could ultimately risk financial penalties and even jail time by defying the committee. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump's tax returns, accusing Mnuchin of choosing to violate the law to keep Trump's records hidden away.

END OF SUMMARY.
