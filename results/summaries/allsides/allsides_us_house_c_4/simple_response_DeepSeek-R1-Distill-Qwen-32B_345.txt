Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failing to meet a deadline for providing President Trump's tax returns. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, which means I should highlight the conflict between Congress and the administration, the legal implications, and the political stakes involved.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Mnuchin missed the deadline set by the House Ways and Means Committee, led by Chairman Richard Neal. This sets up a possible court battle. The Democrats want the tax returns to investigate potential conflicts of interest, while Republicans see it as a political move. Trump hasn't released his returns, citing an audit, but his lawyer Cohen said he doesn't think there's an audit. The White House says Trump won't hand them over now but might after the audit. Democrats argue that the law requires the Treasury Secretary to provide the records, and failure to do so could lead to contempt of Congress charges and legal action.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key elements: the missed deadline, the possible legal battle, the reasons each side gives, and the implications of the administration's actions. I should also note the moral framing, which seems to present the administration as defying the law and undermining oversight.

Let me structure this: start with Mnuchin missing the deadline, the next steps (subpoena, court battle), the reasons Democrats and Republicans have, Trump's stance, and the legal implications. I'll keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

I should also use the exact terms like "unprecedented" and "fishing expedition" as they carry the moral weight from the original article. I'll make sure to include quotes that emphasize the conflict, like from Rep. Pascrell about the administration's contempt for the rule of law.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary that flows well and hits all the key points without being too verbose.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline, which passed without the IRS and Treasury delivering the requested records. Mnuchin responded by promising a final decision by May 6, marking the second missed deadline since Neal requested the records in April. Democrats seek Trump's returns to investigate possible conflicts of interest due to his business ties, while Republicans condemn the request as a politically motivated "fishing expedition." Trump has refused to release his returns, citing an ongoing audit, though his former lawyer Michael Cohen claimed no audit was active. The White House stated Trump is unlikely to comply, asserting it's not up to him to decide. Democrats argue the law mandates the Treasury Secretary to provide taxpayer data upon request, and failure to comply could lead to contempt charges and legal action. Neal has warned that missing the deadline would be seen as a denial, and legal experts suggest Democrats could sue to obtain the records. The situation highlights a clash over the rule of law and congressional oversight, with Democrats framing the administration's actions as contemptuous. END OF SUMMARY.
