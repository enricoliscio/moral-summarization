Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin missing a deadline to hand over President Trump's tax returns to Congress. This sets up a potential court battle. The user wants a summary that's under 200 words, ending with specific tokens. I should make sure to include the main elements: the missed deadline, the possible legal action, the reasons behind both parties' actions, and the moral implications.

I notice that the article mentions Democrats wanting the tax returns to investigate conflicts of interest, while Republicans see it as a political move. Trump hasn't released his taxes, citing audits, but his lawyer said he wasn't under audit. The moral framing here is about the rule of law and accountability. Democrats argue it's necessary for oversight, while the administration is seen as obstructing.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict, the legal implications, and the underlying moral arguments. I need to keep it concise but cover all these points without exceeding 200 words. Also, I must use the specified tokens at the start and end.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and captures the essence of the article while maintaining the moral perspective presented. I'll make sure to mention the missed deadline, the possible subpoena, the reasons from both sides, and the potential legal battle. That should cover all bases succinctly.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin missed a congressional deadline to hand over President Trump's tax returns, escalating a potential legal battle between Congress and the administration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal had set a final deadline for the IRS and Treasury to provide six years of Trump's tax records, but Mnuchin informed Neal that the administration would not meet the deadline, citing ongoing consultations with the Justice Department. Democrats argue that Trump's tax returns are needed to investigate potential conflicts of interest due to his business dealings, while Republicans claim the request is a politically motivated "fishing expedition." Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing audits, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, stated he did not believe Trump was under audit. Democrats accuse the administration of defying the law and obstructing oversight, while the White House maintains Trump is unlikely to comply. Legal experts suggest that if the administration continues to resist, Congress could subpoena the records, leading to a court battle that may reach the Supreme Court. The situation highlights a clash over the rule of law and accountability in government. END OF SUMMARY.
