Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, failing to meet a congressional deadline for providing President Trump's tax returns. This sets up a potential court battle. The key elements are the deadlines missed, the legal implications, and the political conflict between Democrats and Republicans.

I need to identify the morally framed words in the text. The user listed words like "failed," "missed," "consult," "violate," "hidden," etc. I should incorporate these to maintain the author's moral perspective.

I'll start by stating that Mnuchin failed to meet the deadline, which is a moral failing. Then, mention the possible court battle and the Democrats' intent to subpoena the records. Highlight that the administration missed the deadline, which shows a pattern of non-compliance.

Next, explain that Mnuchin is consulting with the Justice Department, indicating deliberation on legal grounds. Note that Democrats argue the law requires the Treasury to furnish the records, emphasizing the legal obligation.

Include the White House's stance that it's not up to the president, but the Democrats counter that the law is clear. Mention the risk of contempt and legal penalties, showing the administration's defiance.

Finally, conclude with the Democrats' confidence in their legal fight and the potential for the case to reach the Supreme Court, underscoring the ongoing conflict.

I should ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while embedding the moral terms. I'll structure it to highlight the administration's failure, the legal implications, and the ongoing political battle, using the specified words to frame the narrative.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump’s tax returns, setting the stage for a potential court battle. The House Ways and Means Committee, led by Chairman Richard Neal, had demanded the records by 5 p.m., but the deadline lapsed without receiving the documents. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision by May 6, marking the second time the administration missed a House deadline. Democrats argue the law requires the Treasury to furnish taxpayer data upon request, while Republicans condemn the request as a political "fishing expedition." Trump has refused to release his returns, citing an audit, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed no audit was ongoing. Democrats accuse the administration of defying the law and hiding Trump’s records, while Republicans defend the president’s right to privacy. Legal experts warn that ignoring a subpoena could lead to contempt of Congress and financial penalties or jail time. The standoff highlights the administration’s contempt for the rule of law, with Democrats vowing to pursue the matter in court, possibly up to the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
