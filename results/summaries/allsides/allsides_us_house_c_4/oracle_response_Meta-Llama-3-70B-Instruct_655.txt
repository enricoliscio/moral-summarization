SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet the final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. Mnuchin's decision to miss the deadline, which was widely expected, could prompt House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to subpoena Trump's tax records, leading to a legal fight that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats argue that Mnuchin is choosing to violate the law to keep Trump's records hidden away, demonstrating the administration's contempt for the rule of law. By failing to comply with the deadline, Mnuchin is risking financial penalties and even jail time. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump's tax returns, which they believe is necessary to impose oversight on the administration. END OF SUMMARY.
