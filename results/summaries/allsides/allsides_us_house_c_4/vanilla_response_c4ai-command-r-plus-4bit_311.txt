SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline to hand over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting up a potential court battle with Congress. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6, missing two previous deadlines set by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal. Democrats are seeking Trump's tax records as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans have called the request a political "fishing expedition." The White House has indicated that Trump is unlikely to release his returns while under audit, despite his former lawyer's claim that he did not believe an audit was taking place. Democrats could now vote to hold Mnuchin in contempt of Congress and sue in federal court to obtain the returns. Legal experts say administration officials risk fines and jail time by defying the committee's request. The dispute highlights the ongoing battle between Congress and the Trump administration over transparency and oversight.
END OF SUMMARY.
