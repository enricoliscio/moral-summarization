Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. First, I need to understand the article's content and the specific words the author used to frame it morally. The article is about the U.S. Treasury Secretary failing to meet a deadline for providing President Trump's tax returns, leading to a possible legal battle.

I notice the user provided a list of morally charged words like "failed," "missed," "contempt," etc. My task is to summarize the article using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with specific tokens.

I'll start by identifying the key events: Mnuchin missed the deadline, the House committee is planning a subpoena, the legal implications, and the political stances. I need to weave in the moral words without making the summary sound forced. For example, using "failed" when talking about missing the deadline, "contempt" for the potential charges, and "hidden" to describe the tax records.

I should also keep the summary structured, maybe starting with the main event, then the consequences, and the political divide. I'll make sure each sentence includes one or more of the moral words without losing clarity. Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and ends properly with the tokens.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for providing President Donald Trump’s tax returns, setting the stage for a potential legal battle. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal set a 5 p.m. deadline, which lapsed without the IRS or Treasury furnishing the requested records. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision by May 6, marking the second time the administration missed a deadline. Neal accused Mnuchin of failing to comply, stating he would consult counsel about next steps. Mnuchin claimed the request was unprecedented and required Justice Department consultation to determine its consistency with the law. Democrats argue the returns are needed to investigate potential conflicts of interest, while Republicans condemn the request as a political fishing expedition. Trump, who has not released his tax returns since 2016, claims he cannot do so while under audit, though his former lawyer Michael Cohen denied this. The White House reiterated Trump’s reluctance to comply. Democrats assert the law mandates the Treasury secretary to furnish taxpayer data upon request, and failure to comply could lead to contempt charges or legal action. Legal experts warn administration officials risk financial penalties or jail time for defying Congress. Neal’s crusade to impose oversight highlights the administration’s contempt for the rule of law, with Democrats confident they will prevail in any legal battle. END OF SUMMARY.
