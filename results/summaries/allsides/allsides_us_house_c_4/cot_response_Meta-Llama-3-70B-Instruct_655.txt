SUMMARY:
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. This move is seen as a "contempt" for the rule of law by Democrats. Mnuchin claimed that the request is "unprecedented" and that he is still consulting with the Justice Department. Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations of possible "conflicts of interest" posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests. Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition". The White House has said Trump is unlikely to hand over his tax returns, which Democrats say is a violation of the law. Legal experts say administration officials could ultimately risk financial penalties and even jail time by defying the committee. Democrats are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump's tax returns, calling the administration's move "corrupt".
END OF SUMMARY.
