SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a deadline set by Congress to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns, likely setting the stage for a legal battle between the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision on the matter by May 6, but his failure to meet the initial deadline is seen as a denial of the request. Democrats have requested Trump's tax records as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans have condemned the request as a political maneuver. The law is clear that the Treasury Secretary "shall furnish" taxpayer data upon request from an authorized lawmaker, and experts say that defying a subpoena from the House Ways and Means Committee could result in financial penalties and even jail time. The outcome of this dispute remains uncertain, but it raises important questions about the balance of power between Congress and the President and the obligation to uphold the rule of law.
END OF SUMMARY.
