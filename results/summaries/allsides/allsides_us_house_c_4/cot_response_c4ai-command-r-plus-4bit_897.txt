SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a deadline to hand over President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress, defying a legal request from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal. Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision by May 6, despite Democrats condemning the delay as a contempt of Congress. The request for Trump's tax records is part of investigations into possible conflicts of interest, with Democrats confident of their legal right to the documents. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking with precedent and sparking concerns about potential corruption. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley indicated Trump is unlikely to comply, but Democrats are prepared for a legal battle, with experts warning of potential consequences for administration officials, including jail time. The outcome of this dispute may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. 
END OF SUMMARY.
