Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing. They've given two steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing the summary.

Starting with STEP 1: I need to find all the single words in the article that carry a moral connotation. These words should reflect values, judgments, or ethical implications. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "refused," "fails," "contempt," etc. Each of these words has a moral weight, indicating approval or disapproval.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into 200 words, making sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary should capture the main points: Mnuchin missing the deadline, the possible court battle, Democrats' reasons, Republicans' opposition, Trump's refusal, and the legal implications.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows naturally and maintains the moral perspective from the original text. I should avoid adding any new information and stick strictly to the content provided.

I should structure the summary to include the key events and the moral stance of each party involved. For example, highlighting that Democrats view the administration's actions as contemptuous, while Republicans see it as a political move. Also, mentioning Trump's refusal to release returns despite Cohen's statement adds context to his reasoning, which has a moral implication regarding transparency.

I need to be concise but thorough, making sure each important point is covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll start by outlining the main events, then the reactions from both parties, and the potential legal consequences.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it includes all the morally framed words identified and that it accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a congressional deadline for providing President Trump’s tax returns, setting the stage for a potential court battle. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal had demanded the records, but Mnuchin missed the deadline and promised a final decision by May 6. Democrats argue that Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns violates the law and undermines transparency, while Republicans label the request a political “fishing expedition.” Trump has consistently refused to release his returns, citing an audit, though his former lawyer Michael Cohen claimed no audit was ongoing. Democrats accuse the administration of contempt for the rule of law, while Republicans defend Trump’s actions. Legal experts suggest Democrats could sue if the administration defies a subpoena, potentially leading to financial penalties or jail time for officials. The situation highlights the ongoing conflict between executive privilege and congressional oversight.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
