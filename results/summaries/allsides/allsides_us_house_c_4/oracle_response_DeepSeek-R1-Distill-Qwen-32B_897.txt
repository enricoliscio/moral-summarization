Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, missing a deadline to provide President Trump's tax returns to Congress. This sets up a potential legal battle. The key events are Mnuchin missing the deadline, the possible subpoena, the legal implications, and the political stances from both parties.

I need to identify the morally framed words used in the article. Words like "failed," "missed," "consult," "consistent," "furnish," "failure," "ignored," "risk," "jail," "defying," "choosing," "violate," "hidden," "contempt," "crusade," "impose," "comply," "subpoena." These words carry moral judgments, so I should incorporate them where appropriate.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with Mnuchin failing to meet the deadline, then mention the possible court battle. Include that it was the second time they missed a deadline. Then, explain that Mnuchin promised a decision by May 6. Democrats want the returns for oversight, while Republicans see it as a political move. Trump hasn't released his returns, citing audits, but Cohen said he wasn't under audit. The White House says Trump won't hand them over. Democrats argue it's their legal right, and there could be contempt charges if they defy the subpoena. The summary should end with the expectation of a legal battle, possibly involving the Supreme Court.

I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral framing words are included. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral terms are used appropriately.

SUMMARY: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline for turning over President Donald Trump’s tax returns, setting the stage for a potential court battle. The deadline lapsed without the House Ways and Means Committee receiving the requested documents. Mnuchin pledged to make a "final decision" by May 6 but did not comply with the deadline, marking the second time the administration missed a House deadline. Democrats argue that the request is lawful and necessary for oversight, while Republicans condemn it as a political "fishing expedition." Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing audits, though his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, claimed no audit was ongoing. Democrats assert that the law requires the Treasury secretary to "furnish" taxpayer data upon request, and failure to comply could lead to contempt charges or legal action. The administration’s defiance risks financial penalties and even jail time. Democrats remain confident in their legal stance, framing the effort as a "crusade" to impose oversight on the administration. The situation underscores the administration’s "contempt for the rule of law," with the potential for a prolonged legal battle, possibly reaching the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
