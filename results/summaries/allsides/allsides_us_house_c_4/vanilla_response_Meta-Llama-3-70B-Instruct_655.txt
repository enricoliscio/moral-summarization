SUMMARY:

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has failed to meet the final congressional deadline to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal had set a 5 p.m. deadline for the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury to provide six years of Trump's individual and business tax records. Mnuchin instead released a letter stating that he would make a "final decision" on whether to provide the tax records by May 6. Democrats want Trump's returns as part of their investigations into possible conflicts of interest, while Republicans have condemned the request as a political "fishing expedition". The outcome could lead to a subpoena and a legal fight that may ultimately be settled by the US Supreme Court.

END OF SUMMARY.
