SUMMARY:
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused to meet the deadline set by Congress for turning over President Donald Trump's tax returns, setting the stage for a possible battle in court. The deadline passed without the Treasury providing Trump's tax records, and Mnuchin pledged to make a final decision by May 6. This was the second time the administration missed a deadline, prompting Democrats to consider legal action. They condemned the refusal as a political "fishing expedition" and broke decades-old precedent by refusing to release Trump's tax returns. The administration's stance was deemed "not up to the president" and a violation of the law. Democrats are confident about succeeding in court and imposing oversight on the corrupt administration. Despite these efforts, the outcome will likely result in a legal battle, with the Supreme Court having the final say.
END OF SUMMARY.
