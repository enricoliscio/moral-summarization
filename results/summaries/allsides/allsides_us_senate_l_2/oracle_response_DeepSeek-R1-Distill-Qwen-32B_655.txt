Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package after six months of fighting, mainly due to delays caused by President Trump's demands. Trump wanted more funding for the border and was reluctant to provide sufficient aid for Puerto Rico, which slowed down the process. The final package includes aid for Puerto Rico but excludes border funding. The delays have caused significant problems for disaster-affected areas.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: fighting, approved, aid, relief, help, thrown, spurring, balked, caused, delay, support, limit, helping, made, delaying, destruction, care, slowed, delays, destroyed, finagling, assistance, damage, taken, fight, left, squabbles, politicization.

I should include as many of these words as possible in the summary without making it too long. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight the approval, the causes of the delay, the impact of the delay, and the consequences for affected areas.

I'll start by mentioning the Senate's approval after six months of fighting. Then, explain Trump's role in causing delays with his demands for border aid and limiting Puerto Rico's aid. Next, note the final package's contents and the delays' consequences, such as destruction and damage in various regions. Finally, touch on the politicization affecting future disaster responses.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the moral framing words appropriately. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence captures a key point and uses the necessary terms.

SUMMARY: After six months of fighting, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing relief to millions affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The delay was caused by President Trump, who initially balked at additional funding for Puerto Rico and later demanded $4.5 billion for the border. Despite his efforts, the final package stripped out border aid and allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. The delays caused by Trump's interference have had devastating consequences, leaving millions without timely assistance. Puerto Rico, still recovering from Hurricane Maria, faced destruction and a lack of medical care, while other regions like Florida, Iowa, and California continue to rebuild. The politicization of disaster aid has slowed progress, leaving affected communities hanging in the balance. The final package, though approved, reflects the fallout of Trump's involvement, highlighting how partisan squabbles have left Americans waiting for help. END OF SUMMARY.
