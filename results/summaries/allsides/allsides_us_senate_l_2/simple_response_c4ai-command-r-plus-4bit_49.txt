SUMMARY: After six months of delays and political wrangling, the US Senate finally approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing much-needed relief to Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The process was marred by the involvement of President Donald Trump, who initially took issue with aid to Puerto Rico and later requested additional funding for the border. The final package largely ignored Trump's demands, allocating $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico while stripping out border aid. The consequences of the delay are staggering, with Americans across the country waiting for aid a year after Hurricane Maria, seven months after Hurricane Michael, and two months after devastating floods. The politicization of disaster aid by Trump and the prolonged negotiations in Congress have left people's lives hanging in the balance and raise concerns about the future of disaster relief in the US. END OF SUMMARY.
