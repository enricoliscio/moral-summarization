SUMMARY:

The US Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package after six months of negotiations, which will provide relief to millions of Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage was delayed due to President Trump's demands, including additional funding for border aid and limiting aid to Puerto Rico. However, the final package does not include border aid funding and allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. The deal is expected to pass the House and be signed by Trump. The delay in disaster relief has had significant consequences, leaving millions of people waiting for aid in regions affected by natural disasters, including Puerto Rico, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and California. The politicization of the disaster aid fight may hinder future responses to natural disasters.
