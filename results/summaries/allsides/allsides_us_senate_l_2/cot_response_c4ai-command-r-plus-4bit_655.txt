SUMMARY: After six months of fighting, the Senate approved a deal on disaster aid, allocating $19.1 billion in relief to Americans affected by devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. However, the passage of the package was challenging due to roadblocks thrown up by President Trump, whose demands were not addressed in the final deal. Trump caused major problems by inserting himself into the fight, being a big reason for the delay in disaster relief. His baseless allegations about Puerto Rico's mismanagement of funds played a role in delaying agreement on the package. The fallout of this delay is staggering, with millions of people waiting for aid while partisan squabbles continue. The politicization of disaster aid does not bode well for the future. END OF SUMMARY.
