SUMMARY:

After six months of delay, the Senate has finally approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package to help millions of Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of this package was challenging due to President Trump's roadblocks, particularly his opposition to additional funding for Puerto Rico and his request for $4.5 billion in aid for the border. Despite his efforts, the final package does not meet his demands, with funding for border aid stripped out and $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico. Trump's actions caused significant delays in disaster relief, with millions of people waiting for aid. The consequences of these delays are staggering, with people's efforts to rebuild left hanging in the balance. The politicization of this fight does not bode well for future natural disasters.

END OF SUMMARY.
