SUMMARY:

The US Senate has finally approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, ending a six-month delay caused by President Trump's roadblocks. Trump initially objected to additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and later requested $4.5 billion in aid for the border, which complicated discussions. However, the final package does not address either of Trump's demands, with funding for border aid stripped out and $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico. Trump's actions have been a major reason for the delay in disaster relief, causing harm to millions of Americans waiting for help. The delay has had staggering consequences, with people in affected regions waiting for over a year for aid to rebuild housing, improve infrastructure, and provide nutritional assistance. The politicization of this fight does not bode well for future natural disasters. The House is expected to pass the legislation, and Trump has agreed to sign it.

END OF SUMMARY.
