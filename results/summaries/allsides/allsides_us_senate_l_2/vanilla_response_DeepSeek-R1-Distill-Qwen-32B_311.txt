Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. The article is about the Senate approving a disaster aid package after six months of fighting, mainly due to President Trump's involvement. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The main points are: the Senate approved $19.1 billion in disaster aid, the delays caused by Trump's objections, the funding for Puerto Rico, the border aid request, and the consequences of the delay.

I should start by identifying the most important information. The approval amount, the causes of the delay, and the impact on affected areas are crucial. Also, noting that the final package didn't meet Trump's demands is important.

Next, I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I should avoid getting bogged down in details but ensure all main points are covered. 

I should structure it by first stating the approval, then the reasons for the delay, the funding allocations, and the consequences of the delay. Finally, mention the political implications for future aid.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and is easy to understand. Also, I should use clear and concise language without jargon.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. I'll start by outlining each paragraph and then condense each into a sentence or two.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are included and that the summary is coherent and meets the word limit. 

Finally, I'll format it with the "SUMMARY:" token at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end, as per the user's instructions.

SUMMARY: After six months of political delays, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package for hurricane, wildfire, and flood victims. President Trump caused significant hold-ups by objecting to funding for Puerto Rico and requesting border aid, which were ultimately excluded from the final deal. Puerto Rico received $1.4 billion, while border funding was stripped out. The delay has exacerbated the struggles of affected communities, including Puerto Rico, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and California, where infrastructure and livelihoods remain damaged. The politicization of disaster aid highlights the challenges of bipartisan cooperation in crisis situations. END OF SUMMARY.
