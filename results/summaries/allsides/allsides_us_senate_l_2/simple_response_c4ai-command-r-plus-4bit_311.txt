SUMMARY: After months of unnecessary delays, the Senate has finally approved a disaster aid package, providing much-needed relief to Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The $19.1 billion package includes $1.4 billion in aid for Puerto Rico, despite President Trump's baseless accusations of financial mismanagement and attempts to block aid. Trump also caused unnecessary delays by requesting border aid funding, which has now been stripped from the final package. The delays have had devastating consequences for those waiting for aid, with people's lives and livelihoods hanging in the balance. This politicization of disaster aid is immoral and sets a dangerous precedent for future relief efforts. Lawmakers must prioritize the needs of their constituents over partisan squabbles and the whims of an irresponsible president. The fallout from the delays is staggering, with Americans across the country still struggling to rebuild their lives and communities. END OF SUMMARY.
