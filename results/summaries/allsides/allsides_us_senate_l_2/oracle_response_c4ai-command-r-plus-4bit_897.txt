SUMMARY: After months of fighting, the Senate finally approved a disaster aid package, providing much-needed relief to Americans affected by natural disasters. President Trump threw roadblocks in the way of aid by initially taking issue with funding for Puerto Rico and then requesting additional aid for the border. The final package does not address Trump's demands, but it does allocate $1.4 billion in aid to Puerto Rico. The delays in aid have had devastating consequences, with people in Puerto Rico, Florida, Iowa, and Missouri still waiting for help months after hurricanes, floods, and wildfires destroyed their homes and livelihoods. The politicization of disaster aid caused by Trump's involvement has left people's lives hanging in the balance and raises concerns about the future of disaster relief in the United States. Lawmakers are expected to continue finagling over the additional border aid requested by Trump, but for now, the disaster aid package will provide some much-needed support to those who have been waiting far too long.
END OF SUMMARY.
