SUMMARY:

The US Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, which will provide relief to millions of Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The package's passage was delayed for six months due to President Donald Trump's demands, including additional funding for the border and limiting aid to Puerto Rico. Trump's requests were ultimately stripped from the deal, with $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico and no funding for border aid. The delay in disaster relief has had significant consequences, with millions of people waiting for aid in regions affected by natural disasters. The politicization of disaster aid has hindered the response to these crises, leaving people's efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance. The House is expected to pass the legislation, and Trump has agreed to sign it.
