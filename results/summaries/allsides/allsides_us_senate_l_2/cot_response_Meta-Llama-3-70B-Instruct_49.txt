SUMMARY:
After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a deal on disaster aid, green-lighting $19.1 billion in relief to millions of Americans who have been waiting for help in the wake of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. President Donald Trump's roadblocks and aversion to helping Puerto Rico caused major problems and delay in disaster relief. His allegations of mismanaging funds and requests for border aid further complicated discussions. The final deal does not address Trump's demands, and funding for border aid has been completely stripped out. The politicization of this fight doesn't bode well for the next time Americans may need help after a natural disaster. The staggering fallout of this delay has left millions of people waiting on aid, with efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance. END OF SUMMARY.
