SUMMARY:

The US Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, ending a six-month delay. The package provides relief to millions of Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The delay was largely caused by President Trump, who initially opposed additional funding for Puerto Rico and later requested $4.5 billion in aid for the border. However, the final package does not include border aid and allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. The House is expected to pass the legislation, and Trump has agreed to sign it. The delay has had significant consequences, with millions of people waiting for aid in regions affected by disasters. The politicization of disaster aid has raised concerns about the response to future natural disasters.

END OF SUMMARY.
