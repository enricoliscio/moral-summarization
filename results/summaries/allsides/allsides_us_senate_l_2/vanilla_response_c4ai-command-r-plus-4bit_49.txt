SUMMARY: The Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package to provide relief to Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of the package was delayed due to President Trump's demands for additional funding for border aid and his opposition to providing aid to Puerto Rico. The final package does not address Trump's demands, allocating $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico and stripping border aid funding. The House is expected to pass the legislation, and Trump has agreed to sign it. The delays in disaster aid have had significant consequences, with people in affected regions waiting for aid for months. The politicization of disaster aid does not bode well for future relief efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
