Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Senate approving a disaster aid package after six months of fighting. The amount approved is $19.1 billion for people affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The process was complicated because President Trump had some issues with it. He initially opposed additional funding for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, which caused a lot of back-and-forth. Then he wanted $4.5 billion for the border, which added more complications.

The final package didn't include the border aid he wanted; that was stripped out. Instead, Puerto Rico got $1.4 billion, which is more than Trump's initial $600 million offer. The House is expected to pass the bill, and Trump agreed to sign it.

The delay caused by Trump's involvement had serious consequences. It's been over a year since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, and other regions are still waiting for aid. The delay affected many areas, including Nebraska, Missouri, California, and the South, where people are struggling to rebuild.

The article also mentions that the politicization of disaster aid doesn't bode well for future emergencies.

So, the key points are:
- Senate approves $19.1 billion after six months.
- Trump's opposition to Puerto Rico funding and border aid caused delays.
- Final package includes $1.4 billion for Puerto Rico, no border aid.
- The delay affected many regions, with significant consequences.
- The politicization could impact future disaster responses.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and covers all these points without getting too detailed. I should structure it to first state the approval, then the reasons for the delay, the final allocations, and the consequences of the delay.

I think that's a good structure. Let me put it together in a clear and concise manner.

SUMMARY: After six months of political contention, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing relief to millions affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. Delays were caused by President Trump's objections to additional funding for Puerto Rico and his request for $4.5 billion in border aid. The final package allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, exceeding Trump's initial offer, but excluded border funding. The House is expected to pass the bill, which Trump has agreed to sign. The prolonged negotiations, driven by Trump's involvement, delayed aid to regions like Puerto Rico, Florida, Iowa, and Missouri, exacerbating the impact of disasters. The politicization of disaster aid raises concerns for future emergencies. END OF SUMMARY.
