SUMMARY:
After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a deal on disaster aid, allocating $19.1 billion in relief to millions of Americans affected by devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. However, President Donald Trump's "roadblocks" and "demands" caused significant delays, with his "aversion" to helping Puerto Rico being a major obstacle. Trump's "allegations" about the regional government mismanaging funds were unfounded, and his request for border aid was a "sticking point" that ultimately got stripped out of the deal. The delay has had "staggering" consequences, leaving millions of people waiting for aid, and the politicization of this fight does not bode well for future disaster relief efforts. The final package does not address Trump's "demands," and he has agreed to sign it. END OF SUMMARY.
