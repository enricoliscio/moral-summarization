SUMMARY: The Senate has finally approved disaster aid after six months of fighting, green-lighting $19.1 billion in relief to Americans who have been waiting for help in the wake of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. However, the passage of this package faced significant roadblocks due to President Donald Trump's involvement. Trump initially took issue with additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and later requested aid for the border, complicating discussions. The final package does not address Trump's demands, with border aid stripped and limited funding allocated to Puerto Rico. The delay in disaster aid has had staggering consequences, affecting millions of people in need across the country. The politicization of disaster relief does not bode well for future efforts to help Americans in the wake of natural disasters. END OF SUMMARY.
