Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about the Senate approving a disaster aid package after six months of fighting, especially with President Trump's involvement causing delays. 

First, I should identify the main points. The Senate approved $19.1 billion for disaster relief after hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. Trump's issues with Puerto Rico funding and his request for border aid complicated things. The final package didn't include his border funding but allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. The delay caused significant issues for affected areas, especially Puerto Rico, which still hasn't recovered from Hurricane Maria. The author is critical of Trump's role in the delays, highlighting how his political demands slowed down aid, which affected people's lives and recovery efforts.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral angle: the delay in aid due to political brinkmanship, particularly Trump's actions, leading to negative consequences for disaster victims. I should mention the consequences, like the time passed since the disasters and the ongoing struggles in places like Puerto Rico.

I'll structure the summary to first state the approval of the aid package, then explain the reasons for the delay (Trump's issues with Puerto Rico and border funding), then the outcome of the package, and finally the consequences of the delay. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and flows well.

I also need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without using any markdown. Let me put it all together now, ensuring I cover all the key points and maintain the moral critique of Trump's actions causing unnecessary delays.

SUMMARY: After six months of political contention, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, addressing relief for hurricane, wildfire, and flood victims. Delays were caused by President Trump's objections to funding for Puerto Rico and his request for border aid, which were ultimately excluded. The final package allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, despite Trump's earlier resistance. The prolonged negotiations exacerbated the fallout, leaving millions without timely aid, particularly in Puerto Rico where infrastructure and medical care were severely impacted. The delay highlights the consequences of political brinkmanship, leaving disaster-affected communities in prolonged distress. END OF SUMMARY.
