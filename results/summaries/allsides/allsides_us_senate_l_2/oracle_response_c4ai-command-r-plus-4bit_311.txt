SUMMARY: After months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a deal on disaster relief, green-lighting much-needed aid to Americans affected by recent hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of the package faced significant challenges due to roadblocks thrown up by President Trump, who initially took issue with aid to Puerto Rico and later requested additional border aid, causing delays in the process. The final package does not address Trump's demands, but it does allocate $1.4 billion in aid to Puerto Rico, a departure from Trump's previous stance. The delays in disaster relief have had staggering consequences, with people in affected regions waiting for help while lawmakers and the president finagled over the package. The politicization of disaster aid has left people's efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance, with millions across the country in need of assistance. The fallout from the delay is devastating, as it has been over a year since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, and other natural disasters continue to take a toll. The fight over aid has caused unnecessary delays in helping those who desperately need support and relief.
END OF SUMMARY.
