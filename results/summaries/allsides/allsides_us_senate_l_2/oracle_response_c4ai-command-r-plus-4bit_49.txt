SUMMARY: After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a disaster relief package, green-lighting $19.1 billion in aid to Americans affected by recent natural disasters. The passage of this package was delayed due to roadblocks thrown up by President Trump, who initially took issue with additional funding for Puerto Rico and later requested border aid funding. The final package does not address Trump's demands and strips out the requested border aid funding. This delay in disaster aid has had staggering consequences, with millions of people waiting for help months after hurricanes, wildfires, and floods destroyed their homes and livelihoods. The politicization of disaster aid and Trump's involvement in the fight have caused major problems and left people's efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance.
END OF SUMMARY.
