SUMMARY:

After six months of "fighting", the Senate has finally "approved" a deal on disaster aid, providing $19.1 billion in "relief" to millions of Americans who have been waiting for "help" in the wake of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. President Donald Trump's actions "thrown" roadblocks, "spurring" months of back-and-forth on the subject. He initially "balked" at additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico, and later requested $4.5 billion in aid for the border, further "delaying" discussions. The final package does not address either of Trump's demands, with funding for border aid stripped out and $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico. Trump's actions have "caused" major problems, "delaying" disaster relief and "slowing" progress. The fallout of this delay is "staggering", leaving millions of people waiting on aid, and the politicization of this fight doesn't bode well for the next time Americans may need help after a natural disaster.

END OF SUMMARY.
