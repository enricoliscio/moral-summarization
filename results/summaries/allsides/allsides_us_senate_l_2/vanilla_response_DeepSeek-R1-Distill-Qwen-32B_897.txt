Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Senate approving a disaster aid package after six months of fighting. The amount is $19.1 billion, which is meant to help people affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. It mentions that disaster aid isn't usually a big political issue, but this time it was because of President Trump's involvement.

Initially, Trump had issues with funding for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. He wanted to limit aid there, which caused delays. Then, he requested $4.5 billion for the border, which complicated things further. The final package didn't include his border funding and allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, which was more than he initially wanted.

The House is expected to pass the legislation, and Trump has agreed to sign it. The article also talks about how Trump's involvement delayed the aid, causing problems for Puerto Rico, Florida, and other areas. The delay has had major consequences, with millions of people waiting for help. The article also mentions that the politicization of disaster aid isn't good for future needs.

So, the key points are: Senate approves $19.1 billion disaster aid after six months, Trump's opposition to Puerto Rico aid and border funding caused delays, the final package includes $1.4 billion for Puerto Rico and no border funds, and the delay has hurt affected areas.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures all these points clearly.
