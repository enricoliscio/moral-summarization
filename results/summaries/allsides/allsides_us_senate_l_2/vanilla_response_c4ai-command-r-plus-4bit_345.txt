SUMMARY: The Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package to provide relief to Americans affected by recent hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of the package was delayed due to President Trump's demands for additional funding for border aid and his opposition to providing aid to Puerto Rico. The final package does not address Trump's demands, allocating only $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico and stripping out funding for border aid. The House is expected to pass the legislation, and Trump has agreed to sign it. The delays in disaster aid have had significant consequences, with millions of people waiting for aid more than a year after Hurricane Maria and seven months after Hurricane Michael. The politicization of disaster aid does not bode well for future relief efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
