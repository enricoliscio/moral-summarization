SUMMARY:

After six months of delay, the Senate has finally approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, despite President Trump's attempts to politicize the process. Trump's initial objections to additional funding for Puerto Rico and his request for $4.5 billion in border aid caused months of back-and-forth. However, the final package does not include funding for border aid and allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, exceeding Trump's initial offer of $600 million. Trump's actions have been widely criticized, with Democrats arguing that his aversion to helping Puerto Rico is rooted in unfounded allegations of mismanaged funds. The delay in disaster relief has had devastating consequences, leaving millions of Americans waiting for aid in the wake of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The politicization of this process raises concerns for future natural disasters.
