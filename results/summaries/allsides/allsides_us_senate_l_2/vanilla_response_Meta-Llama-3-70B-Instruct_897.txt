SUMMARY:

The US Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package after six months of fighting, providing relief to millions of Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage was delayed due to President Trump's demands, including additional funding for the border and limiting aid to Puerto Rico. The final package does not include funding for border aid and allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. Trump had previously requested $4.5 billion for border aid and opposed providing more than $600 million in nutritional assistance to Puerto Rico. The delay in disaster relief has had major consequences, leaving millions of people waiting for aid in regions affected by natural disasters. The politicization of this fight may impact future disaster relief efforts.
