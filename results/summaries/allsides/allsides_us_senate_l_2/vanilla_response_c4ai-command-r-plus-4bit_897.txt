SUMMARY: After months of debate and delay, the Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package to provide relief to Americans affected by recent hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of the package was complicated by President Trump's demands for additional funding for border aid and his opposition to aid for Puerto Rico. The final package does not address Trump's demands and allocates $1.4 billion in aid to Puerto Rico. The delays in disaster relief have had significant consequences, with millions of people waiting for aid more than a year after Hurricane Maria and months after other disasters. The politicization of disaster aid and Trump's involvement have caused major problems and left people's efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance.
END OF SUMMARY.
