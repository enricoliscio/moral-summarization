SUMMARY: After months of unnecessary and damaging delays, the Senate has finally approved a disaster aid package that will provide much-needed relief to millions of Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of this package was challenging due to the selfish and immoral roadblocks put up by President Donald Trump, who attempted to use the suffering of Americans as a political bargaining chip. Trump's demands, which included limiting aid to hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and requesting aid for the border, caused significant delays in getting aid to those who desperately needed it. The final package does not address Trump's demands, and rightfully so. The consequences of these delays are staggering, with Americans across the country waiting for aid more than a year after Hurricane Maria and facing devastating consequences from subsequent natural disasters. The politicization of disaster aid by Trump and the subsequent delay in relief is immoral and should not be tolerated. It is unconscionable to use the suffering of Americans as a political tool, and those responsible for these delays must be held accountable.

END OF SUMMARY.
