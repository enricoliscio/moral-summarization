SUMMARY:

After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a deal on disaster aid, providing $19.1 billion in relief to millions of Americans who have been waiting for help. The passage of this package was delayed due to roadblocks thrown up by President Donald Trump, who initially balked at additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and later requested $4.5 billion in aid for the border. The final deal does not address either of Trump's demands, with funding for border aid stripped out and $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico. Trump's actions caused major problems and delays in disaster relief, slowing progress to a halt. The fallout of this delay is staggering, leaving millions of people waiting on aid, including those affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The politicization of this fight doesn't bode well for the next time Americans may need help after a natural disaster.

END OF SUMMARY.
