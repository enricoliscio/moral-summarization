SUMMARY:
After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a deal on disaster aid, allocating $19.1 billion in relief to millions of Americans affected by devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. However, President Donald Trump's "aversion" to helping Puerto Rico and his demand for $4.5 billion in aid for the border caused significant "roadblocks" and "complications" in the negotiations. Trump's "allegations" of mismanaging funds by the Puerto Rican government, without evidence, further stalled the process. The final deal does not include funding for border aid and allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, exceeding Trump's initial offer of $600 million. The "politicization" of disaster aid has had "staggering" consequences, leaving millions of people waiting for aid. The delay has affected Americans nationwide, from farmers in the Midwest to hurricane victims in the South. END OF SUMMARY.
