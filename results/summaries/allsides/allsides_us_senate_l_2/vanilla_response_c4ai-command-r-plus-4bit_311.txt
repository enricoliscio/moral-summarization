SUMMARY: After a six-month battle, the Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, with the House expected to pass it on Friday. The aid will provide relief to Americans affected by recent natural disasters, including hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of the package was delayed due to President Trump's demands for additional funding for border aid and his opposition to aid for Puerto Rico. The final package does not address Trump's demands, allocating only $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico and stripping border aid funding entirely. The delay in aid has had significant consequences, with Americans in Puerto Rico, Florida, Iowa, and Missouri still waiting for assistance months after the disasters occurred. The politicization of disaster aid and Trump's involvement have caused major problems and delays in relief efforts.
