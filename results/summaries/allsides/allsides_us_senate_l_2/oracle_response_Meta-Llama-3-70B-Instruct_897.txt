SUMMARY:

After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing relief to millions of Americans affected by devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. However, the passage of this package was delayed due to roadblocks thrown up by President Donald Trump, who initially balked at additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and later requested $4.5 billion in aid for the border. The final deal does not address either of Trump's demands, with funding for border aid stripped out and $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico. Trump's actions caused major delays in disaster relief, with Democrats arguing that aid to Puerto Rico should go beyond food stamps and support infrastructure rebuilding. The fallout of this delay is staggering, with millions of people waiting for aid and the need for assistance touching every part of the country. The politicization of this fight does not bode well for the next time Americans may need help after a natural disaster. END OF SUMMARY.
