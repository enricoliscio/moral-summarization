SUMMARY: The US Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package to provide relief to Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of the package was delayed due to President Trump's demands for additional funding for border aid and his opposition to aid for Puerto Rico. The final package does not address Trump's demands, allocating $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico and removing border aid funding. The delays in disaster aid have had significant consequences, with millions of people waiting for assistance months after the disasters occurred. The politicization of disaster aid and Trump's involvement have caused major problems and delays in relief efforts. The fallout from the delays is staggering, with Americans nationwide affected by disasters still awaiting aid and assistance with rebuilding efforts.
