SUMMARY:
After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a deal on disaster aid, green-lighting $19.1 billion in relief to millions of Americans who have been waiting for help in the wake of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. However, the passage of this package proved especially challenging due to President Donald Trump's roadblocks and aversion to helping Puerto Rico. Trump's demands, including $4.5 billion in aid for the border, further complicated discussions and caused a major delay in disaster relief. The final deal does not address Trump's demands, and instead allocates $1.4 billion in aid to Puerto Rico. The fallout of this delay is staggering, leaving millions of people in affected regions waiting on aid. The politicization of this fight doesn't bode well for the next time Americans may need help after a natural disaster. END OF SUMMARY.
