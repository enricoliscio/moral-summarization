Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the Senate approving a $19.1 billion disaster aid package after six months of fighting. The main issues were President Trump's objections, especially regarding Puerto Rico and border aid. Trump wanted more for Puerto Rico but also pushed for border funding, which complicated things. The final package includes $1.4 billion for Puerto Rico and excludes border aid. The House is set to pass it, and Trump agreed to sign it. The delays caused by Trump's involvement have had negative consequences for disaster-hit areas. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: the approval, Trump's role, funding details, and the impact of delays.

SUMMARY: After six months of political contention, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing relief to millions affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The delay was largely due to President Trump's objections, including his resistance to additional funding for Puerto Rico and his demand for $4.5 billion in border aid. The final package allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, surpassing Trump's initial $600 million offer, and excludes border funding. The House is expected to pass the bill, which Trump has agreed to sign. The prolonged negotiations caused significant delays, leaving disaster-affected communities without timely aid. The politicization of disaster relief highlights the challenges in providing timely assistance during future crises. END OF SUMMARY.
