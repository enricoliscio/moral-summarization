Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the Senate approving a $19.1 billion disaster aid package after six months of fighting. It mentions that this aid is for people affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. 

The main issue seems to be the involvement of President Trump. He had problems with the funding for Puerto Rico, initially opposing more than $600 million. Then he wanted $4.5 billion for the border, which complicated things. In the end, the package didn't include the border funding and allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. 

The House is expected to pass it, and Trump agreed to sign it. The delays caused by Trump have had major consequences, like Puerto Rico still struggling a year after Hurricane Maria. Other areas are also affected, like Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, California, and the South. The article ends by saying this politicization isn't good for future disaster aid.

So, the summary should include the approval of the package, the delay caused by Trump's demands, the allocation to Puerto Rico, the removal of border funding, the consequences of the delay, and the impact on various regions.

I need to make sure it's under 200 words and covers all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY: After six months of political contention, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package for Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. Delays were caused by President Trump's demands for additional funding for Puerto Rico and $4.5 billion for the border. The final package allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico and excludes border funding. The House is set to pass the bill, which Trump has agreed to sign. Delays have left millions without aid for over a year, exacerbating struggles in Puerto Rico, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and California. The politicization of disaster aid raises concerns for future emergencies. END OF SUMMARY.
