SUMMARY:

After six months of "fighting" and delays, the Senate has finally "approved" a deal on disaster aid, providing $19.1 billion in "relief" to millions of Americans affected by devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of this package was "slowed" by President Donald Trump, who initially "balked" at additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and later requested $4.5 billion in aid for the border, which further complicated discussions. The final deal does not address either of Trump's demands, with funding for border aid stripped out and $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico. Trump's actions have "caused" major problems and "delays" in disaster relief, leaving millions of people waiting for "help" and "assistance". The politicization of this fight has had "staggering" consequences, with people's efforts to rebuild left "hanging in the balance" while partisan "squabbles" continued.

END OF SUMMARY.
