Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also provided a specific structure to follow. Let me break this down.

First, I need to identify all the single words in the article that have a moral connotation. These words are likely to express approval or disapproval. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "devastating," "waiting," "roadblocks," "challenging," "balked," "struggling," "aversion," "overwhelmed," "staggering," "delayed," "hang," "squabbles," "politicization," "toll," "salvage," "loss," "broke," and "broke." These words carry moral weight, showing the negative impact of the delays.

Next, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the key points: the Senate approved $19.1 billion in disaster aid after six months, Trump's role in delaying the process, issues with Puerto Rico and border aid, the consequences of the delay, and the broader implications for future disaster responses.

I'll make sure to include words like "devastating," "waiting," "roadblocks," and "struggling" to maintain the moral tone. I'll also highlight Trump's aversion to helping Puerto Rico and the politicization of the aid, which shows the negative impact on those affected.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the approval, then the delays, the consequences, and the implications. I'll keep it concise, ensuring it's within the word limit and that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

**SUMMARY:**  
After six months of delays, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, addressing relief for millions affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. President Trump's demands for additional funding for Puerto Rico and the border caused significant roadblocks, delaying aid for those struggling in disaster-hit areas. Trump's aversion to supporting Puerto Rico, based on unfounded claims of mismanagement, and his request for border aid further complicated negotiations. The final package stripped out border funding and allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, despite Trump's opposition. The delays have had staggering consequences, leaving millions waiting for aid as disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Michael in Florida, and floods in Iowa and Missouri caused widespread destruction. The politicization of disaster aid has left rebuilding efforts hanging, with farmers and communities still struggling to recover. The delays highlight the negative impact of partisan squabbles on those in need, raising concerns about future disaster responses. END OF SUMMARY.
