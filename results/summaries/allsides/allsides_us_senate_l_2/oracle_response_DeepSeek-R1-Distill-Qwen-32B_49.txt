Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Senate approving a disaster aid package after six months of fighting, with Trump causing delays by focusing on Puerto Rico and border aid. The author uses words like "fighting," "delay," and "squabbles," so I should include those.

I'll start by noting the approval of $19.1 billion in aid, emphasizing the long delay and Trump's role. Then, I'll mention the issues with Puerto Rico and border funding, showing how Trump's demands complicated things. It's important to highlight that the final package didn't meet Trump's requests, especially for Puerto Rico, which Democrats wanted more aid for.

I should also touch on the consequences of the delay, like the ongoing struggles in affected areas. Words like "destruction," "damage," and "delays" are key here. I'll make sure to include the moral implications, such as the politicization of aid and how it affects people needing help.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by noting the eventual passage and Trump's agreement, but stress the negative impact of the delay. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the morally framed terms as much as possible.

SUMMARY: After six months of fighting, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing relief to millions affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The process was delayed by President Trump, who initially balked at funding for Puerto Rico and later demanded $4.5 billion for the border. Despite his efforts, the final package stripped out border aid and allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico, less than Trump’s previous $600 million offer. The delay caused significant destruction and harm, leaving millions without aid for over a year. Puerto Rico, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and California faced severe damage, with infrastructure and medical care suffering. Trump’s insistence on border funding and Puerto Rico aid limits slowed progress, politicizing the relief efforts. The delays left people’s rebuilding efforts hanging, highlighting the consequences of partisan squabbles. The package, expected to pass the House and signed by Trump, ultimately failed to address his demands, leaving the fallout of destruction and damage unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
