Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Senate approved $19.1 billion in disaster aid after six months of fighting, mainly because of President Trump's interference. He opposed funding for Puerto Rico and wanted money for the border, which complicated things. The final package didn't meet his demands, leading to delays. The delays caused significant issues for disaster-affected areas like Puerto Rico, Florida, and others. The article uses words like "fighting," "delay," and "politicization" to highlight the moral issues of the situation.

I should start the summary by mentioning the approval and the funding amount. Then, explain Trump's role in causing delays with his demands. Highlight the consequences of the delays, such as the impact on Puerto Rico and other areas. Use the morally charged words to convey the frustration and the negative outcomes. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: After six months of fighting, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing relief to millions affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The process was delayed due to President Trump's interference, as he initially balked at funding for Puerto Rico and later demanded $4.5 billion for the border. Despite his efforts, the final package stripped out border aid and allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. The delay caused significant consequences, with millions waiting for assistance while disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Michael in Florida, and flooding in Iowa and Missouri left communities destroyed. The politicization of the aid package slowed progress, leaving people's efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance. The delays underscored the negative impact of partisan squabbles on disaster response, raising concerns about future aid distribution. END OF SUMMARY.
