SUMMARY: After six months of fighting, the Senate finally approved a disaster aid package worth $19.1 billion, which will provide relief to Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of this package was delayed due to roadblocks thrown up by President Trump, who initially took issue with aid to Puerto Rico and later requested additional funding for the border. The final package does not address Trump's demands, stripping out border aid funding and allocating a smaller amount of aid to Puerto Rico. The fallout from the delay in disaster aid is staggering, with people in affected regions waiting for help more than a year after Hurricane Maria and amid ongoing destruction and damage. The politicization of disaster aid, with Trump causing major problems by inserting himself into the fight, has left people's efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance. This delay has had devastating consequences for those in need of aid, with natural disasters affecting Americans across the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
