SUMMARY:

The US Senate has approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package after six months of negotiations, which will provide relief to millions of Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage was delayed due to President Donald Trump's demands, including additional funding for border aid and limiting aid to Puerto Rico. However, the final package does not include funding for border aid and allocates $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. Trump has agreed to sign the legislation, which is expected to pass the House on Friday. The delay in disaster relief has had significant consequences, with millions of people waiting for aid in regions affected by natural disasters. The politicization of disaster aid has hindered progress and may have negative implications for future disaster relief efforts.
