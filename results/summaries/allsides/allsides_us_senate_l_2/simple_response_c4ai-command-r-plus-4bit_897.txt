SUMMARY: After months of unnecessary delay, the Senate has finally approved a disaster aid package, which will provide much-needed relief to Americans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The delay was largely due to the selfish and immoral actions of President Donald Trump, who attempted to use the suffering of Americans as a political bargaining chip. Trump objected to aid for Puerto Rico, spreading baseless allegations of fund mismanagement, and demanded additional funding for his wasteful and inhumane border policies. Thankfully, the final package ignores Trump's demands and includes aid for Puerto Rico. The consequences of the delay are staggering, with Americans across the country waiting for aid months and years after devastating disasters. The politicization of disaster aid by Trump is unconscionable and sets a dangerous precedent for future relief efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
