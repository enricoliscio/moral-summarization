SUMMARY:

After six months of "fighting", the Senate has finally "approved" a deal on disaster "aid", green-lighting $19.1 billion in "relief" to millions of Americans who have been waiting for "help" in the wake of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. President Donald Trump's actions have "caused" major "delays" in disaster "aid", initially taking issue with additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and later requesting $4.5 billion in "aid" for the border. The final package does not address Trump's demands, with funding for border "aid" stripped out and $1.4 billion allocated to Puerto Rico. The "delay" in disaster "relief" has had staggering consequences, leaving millions of people waiting for "assistance" while lawmakers and Trump "finagled" over the package. The politicization of this "fight" does not bode well for future natural disasters.

END OF SUMMARY.
