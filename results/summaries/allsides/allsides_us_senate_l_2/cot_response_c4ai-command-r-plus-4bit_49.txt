END OF SUMMARY. After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a disaster aid package, green-lighting $19.1 billion in relief to Americans waiting for help in the wake of devastating hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The passage of this package proved challenging due to roadblocks thrown up by Trump, who initially took issue with additional funding for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico. Trump's demands for border aid further complicated discussions, but the final package does not address his demands. The delay in disaster aid has had staggering consequences, with millions of people in affected regions waiting for aid while partisan squabbles continue. The politicization of this fight does not bode well for the future when Americans may need help after a natural disaster. END OF SUMMARY
