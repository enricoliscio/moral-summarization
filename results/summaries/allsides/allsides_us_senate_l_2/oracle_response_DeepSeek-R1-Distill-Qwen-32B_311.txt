Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand all the requirements.

The user provided a detailed news article about the Senate approving a disaster aid package after six months of fighting. They highlighted specific morally framed words that should be included in the summary. The task is to create a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, using those words as much as possible.

First, I need to identify the key points of the article. The main points are the approval of $19.1 billion in disaster aid, the delays caused by Trump's involvement, the issues with Puerto Rico funding, the border aid request, and the consequences of the delays on affected areas.

I should make sure to include the morally charged words like "fighting," "approved," "aid," "relief," "help," "thrown," "spurring," "balked," "caused," "delay," "support," "limit," "helping," "made," "delaying," "destruction," "care," "slowed," "delays," "destroyed," "finagling," "assistance," "damage," "taken," "fight," "left," "squabbles," "politicization."

I need to structure the summary to show the conflict, the approval, the reasons for the delay, and the impact on people. I should mention Trump's role in causing the delay, the allocation for Puerto Rico, and the border aid being stripped out.

I also need to highlight the consequences of the delay, such as the ongoing struggles in Puerto Rico, the damage in other states, and the politicization of disaster aid. 

I should ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me draft it, making sure to include all the necessary points and the moral framing words.

SUMMARY: After six months of fighting, the Senate approved a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, providing relief to millions affected by hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. The process was delayed due to President Trump's involvement, including his opposition to additional funding for Puerto Rico and his request for $4.5 billion in border aid. Trump balked at offering more than $600 million for Puerto Rico, while Democrats argued for infrastructure support beyond food stamps. The final package stripped out border aid and allocated $1.4 billion to Puerto Rico. The delays caused by Trump's interference have left millions waiting for assistance, with Puerto Rico still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria. Other regions, like Nebraska, Missouri, and California, have also faced destruction and damage from natural disasters. The politicization of disaster aid has slowed progress, leaving people's efforts to rebuild hanging in the balance. The fallout of this delay is staggering, as aid was needed to address widespread destruction and support affected communities nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
