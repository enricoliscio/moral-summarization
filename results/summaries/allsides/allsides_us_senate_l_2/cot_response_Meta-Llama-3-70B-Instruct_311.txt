SUMMARY:
After six months of fighting, the Senate has finally approved a deal on disaster aid, green-lighting $19.1 billion in relief to millions of Americans who have been waiting for help. The passage of this package proved especially challenging due to President Donald Trump's "roadblocks" and "flashpoint" issues. Trump's "aversion" to helping Puerto Rico, fueled by "allegations" of mismanaging funds, delayed the agreement. His request for $4.5 billion in border aid further complicated discussions. The final package does not address Trump's demands, and funding for border aid has been completely "stripped" out. The delay has had "staggering" consequences, leaving millions of people waiting for aid. The politicization of this fight doesn't bode well for the next time Americans may need help after a natural disaster. END OF SUMMARY.
