SUMMARY:

Mayors across the US are coming together to address the devastating impact of mass shootings in their communities. These tragedies, driven by racist ideology, malice, and hate speech, have led to agonizing losses and a sense of mourning. The mayors recognize that the deadly nexus between intolerance and the obsession with guns must be confronted. They are taking action, empowering young people to call out hate speech and take courageous steps to keep weapons out of the wrong hands. The author, a mayor themselves, reflects on the personal connection they have to cities affected by gun violence, including Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, where their ancestors first found freedom and belonging in the US. They emphasize the importance of involving young people in the conversation, who are fighting against the acceptance of normalized gun violence and striving for a nation where everyone feels safe and belongs. By working together, mayors hope to leave a safer inheritance for future generations.
