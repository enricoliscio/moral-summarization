Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow, so I should make sure I adhere to that. 

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. The user mentioned that I should list each word starting with a * under STEP 1. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "unthinkable," "racist," "hate," "courageous," "righteous," "meaningful," "needless," "devastating," "freedom," "belonging," "exceptional," "sorrowful," "conscience," "inspire," "move," "adversity," "discouraged," "heartbroken," "paralyzed," "challenges," "opportunity," "belong," "safe," "inheritance," and "risk." I should make sure each of these is a single word and that they carry a moral weight in the context.

Next, I have to write a summary of the article, preserving as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, no longer than 200 words, and start after the "SUMMARY:" token. I'll need to capture the main points: the mayors' responsibilities post-mass shootings, the role of young people in addressing gun violence, and the author's personal connection to the issue. I should ensure that the moral framing is evident, using words like "unthinkable," "racist," "hate," and "courageous" to convey the gravity of the situation and the need for action.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key aspects without being too lengthy. I'll structure it to first mention the mayors' roles, then the influence of hate and gun access, followed by the proactive steps taken by mayors and the involvement of young people. Finally, I'll touch on the personal and historical significance to the author, emphasizing the hope for a safer future.

I should double-check that I'm using the morally framed words appropriately and that the summary stays within the word limit. It's important to maintain the tone and message of the original article, highlighting the moral imperative to address gun violence and hate through collective action and the empowerment of youth.
