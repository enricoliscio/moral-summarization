SUMMARY:

Mayors across the US are coming together to address the devastating impact of mass shootings in their communities. The grim reality of gun violence, driven by racist ideology, malice, and hate speech, has led to a circle of mayors who must lead their people forward in the aftermath of tragedy. The author, a mayor themselves, emphasizes the agonizing responsibility of mayors to take action and empower young people to demand change. The mayors are not relying on Washington to solve the deadly nexus between intolerance and the obsession with guns. Instead, they are taking courageous steps to keep weapons out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them. The author's personal connection to cities affected by gun violence, such as Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, underscores the importance of involving young people in the fight against gun violence. By listening to their concerns and ideas, mayors can work towards creating a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe.
