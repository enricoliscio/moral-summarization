Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about mayors dealing with mass shootings and gun violence, the impact on communities, and the efforts to take action, especially involving young people. The author connects this to their personal family history, emphasizing the need for change.

I should identify key morally charged words from the list that are central to the article's message. Words like shootings, tragedy, violence, malice, empowered, steps, loss, and action come to mind. These words convey the moral weight of the issue.

Next, I'll structure the summary to include the main themes: the increase in shootings leading to memorials, the mayors' responsibilities, the role of hate and gun access, and the proactive measures taken, especially involving youth. I'll also touch on the personal connection to the author's family history to highlight the emotional and moral imperative.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the problem, the response from mayors, the involvement of young people, and the personal stake. I'll keep each sentence focused and concise to stay within the word limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it includes as many of the specified moral words as possible without making it sound forced. The goal is to maintain the original's tone and message while being succinct.
