Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is by a mayor, probably Eric Adams, talking about how many cities are now associated with memorials from mass shootings. He mentions mayors from various cities dealing with gun violence, especially when it's driven by racism or hate speech. He criticizes the NRA's influence and says mayors are taking action, focusing on young people's demands to address hate speech and gun control.

He also shares personal stories about his ancestors fleeing violence to come to America, highlighting the importance of feeling safe and belonging. He talks about involving youth in efforts to end gun violence, mentioning a youth council and their campaigns. The moral framing is strong, emphasizing unity, safety, and the responsibility to future generations.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by highlighting the main themes: the increase in cities linked to shootings, mayors' efforts, criticism of NRA, focus on youth, personal ancestral stories, and the moral imperative to create a safe nation.

I should ensure the summary reflects the author's concern for unity, the impact of hate and gun violence, and the hope for a better future through youth involvement. I'll make sure to include the emotional elements and the call to action.

Let me structure it: start with the issue, mention mayors' actions, touch on personal history, and conclude with the hope and responsibility to future generations. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
