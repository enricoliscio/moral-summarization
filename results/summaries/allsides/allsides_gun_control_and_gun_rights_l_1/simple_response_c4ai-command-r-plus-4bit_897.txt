SUMMARY: Gun violence in the United States has created a grim circle of mayors from cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, and Parkland, who are tasked with leading their communities forward in the wake of tragic mass shootings. The author, a mayor themself, reflects on how these incidents are driven by a deadly combination of racist ideology, malice towards immigrants, hate speech, and easy access to military-grade firearms. They criticize the echo chamber of NRA talking points that follows each tragedy and the lack of leadership from Washington to address the intolerance and gun obsession nexus. Instead, mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action, focusing on empowering young people to call out hate speech and advocating for gun control. The author shares a personal connection to the affected cities of Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, highlighting how their family history is intertwined with these places, and how their ancestors sought freedom and belonging in America. They emphasize the importance of listening to and involving young people in the fight against gun violence, drawing inspiration from their Youth Council to End Gun Violence. The summary concludes with a call to action to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, leaving a legacy of freedom from fear and violence for future generations.
