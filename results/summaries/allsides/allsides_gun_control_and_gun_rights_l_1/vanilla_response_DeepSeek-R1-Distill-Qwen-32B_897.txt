Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is by a mayor, talking about how many cities are dealing with mass shootings. He mentions specific cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, Parkland, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso. He's emphasizing the responsibility on mayors to lead after these tragedies, especially when they're driven by hate and easy access to guns.

He also talks about how mayors aren't waiting for Washington to act, instead taking their own steps. The focus is on young people leading the way, like the Youth Council he formed after the Parkland shooting. They're working on campaigns against normalized gun violence and pushing for real change.

The mayor connects this to his family's history, showing how these issues affect everyone. He wants a future where everyone feels safe, inspired by his ancestors' pursuit of freedom and belonging.

So, the main points are: the impact of mass shootings on cities, mayors' proactive approach, youth leadership, and the personal connection to the issue. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include these elements clearly.
