SUMMARY:
Mayors across the US are taking action to address the "unthinkable" tragedy of mass shootings, driven by "racist ideology" and "malice" towards immigrants. They are working to empower young people to demand action against "hate speech" and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them. The author, a mayor, reflects on the personal connection they have to cities affected by mass shootings, including Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, where their ancestors first found freedom and belonging in the US. They emphasize the importance of involving young people in the conversation, who are "armed only with simple, righteous demands" for a safer future. The author's goal is to leave a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe for their daughter, just as their ancestors had hoped for when they arrived in the US. END OF SUMMARY.
