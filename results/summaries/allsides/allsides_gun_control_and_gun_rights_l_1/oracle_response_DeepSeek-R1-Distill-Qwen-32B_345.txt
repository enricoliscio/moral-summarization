Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is from CNN, written by a mayor, I think, talking about mass shootings and the impact on cities. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, and they want those words included in the summary.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It starts by mentioning how many cities are now associated with memorials from mass shootings. The mayors have to deal with the aftermath, which is really sad and difficult. The author talks about how these shootings are driven by racism, malice towards immigrants, and hate speech coming from powerful places. They also mention the easy access to military-grade weapons, which makes it worse.

The author then shifts to the mayors taking action themselves, empowering young people to call out hate speech and take steps to keep weapons away from dangerous people. They also share personal stories about their family's history in cities affected by violence, showing a personal connection to the issue.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the specified moral words as possible. I need to make sure to use words like shootings, deaths, tragedy, violence, driven, malice, hate speech, access, action, empowering, steps, etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should structure the summary to cover the main points: the impact of mass shootings on cities, the mayors' efforts, the role of young people, and the personal connection to the issue. I'll need to weave in the moral words naturally without making it forced.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the problem: mass shootings leading to memorials. Then the mayors' burden. Mention the causes: racism, malice, hate speech. Then the mayors' actions: empowering young people, taking steps to control weapons. Include the personal stories to add emotional weight. Conclude with the hope for a safer future.

I should check the word count to make sure it's under 200. Also, ensure that the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too verbose.

Alright, let me put it all together, making sure to hit all the points and include the necessary moral language.
