SUMMARY: In the aftermath of mass shootings in cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, and Parkland, mayors are left with the daunting task of leading their communities forward. The complex interplay of racist ideology, hateful rhetoric, and easy access to military-grade firearms has resulted in devastating loss of life. Breaking free from the echo chamber of NRA talking points, mayors across the political spectrum are taking matters into their own hands. They are focusing on empowering young people to raise their voices against hate speech and advocate for stricter gun control measures. Personal connections to affected communities, like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, where the author's ancestors sought freedom and belonging, underscore the emotional toll of gun violence. The Youth Summit and the author's Youth Council to End Gun Violence highlight the importance of involving young people in shaping their future, free from the fear of violence. Despite the challenges and heartbreaks, the pursuit of a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe remains the driving force. The author strives to leave a legacy of a safer nation as an inheritance for their daughter, honoring the sacrifices of those who came before.
