Mayors from across the US are united in their efforts to address the devastating impact of mass shootings in their communities. The grim reality of gun violence, driven by racist ideology, malice, and hate speech, has led to a surge in deaths and tragedies. The author, a mayor themselves, acknowledges the agonizing task of leading their people forward in the aftermath of such events. They emphasize the importance of empowering young people to take action against gun violence, calling out hate speech, and taking meaningful steps to keep weapons out of the wrong hands. The author's personal connection to cities affected by mass shootings, such as Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, underscores the urgent need for collective action. By involving and listening to young people, mayors can work towards creating a nation where everyone feels safe and belongs.
