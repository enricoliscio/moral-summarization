SUMMARY: The article discusses the grim reality of mass shootings and how they have impacted so many communities across the United States, creating a fellowship of mayors leading their people through the aftermath of these tragic events. The author, a mayor themself, highlights how these shootings are driven by a deadly nexus of racist ideology, malice, hate speech, and easy access to military-grade weapons. They criticize the echo chamber of NRA talking points that follows each tragedy and the lack of leadership from Washington to address the root causes. Instead, mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action themselves, focusing on empowering young people to call out hate speech and advocate for gun control. The author reflects on how these shootings hit close to home, with personal connections to affected cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, and how their ancestors sought the same freedoms and sense of belonging that today's youth are fighting for. The author is inspired by the young leaders demanding a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, free from the fear of gun violence. They acknowledge the adversity and heartbreak that comes with the issue but remain determined to create a safer future for the next generations, as their ancestors did before them.
END OF SUMMARY.
