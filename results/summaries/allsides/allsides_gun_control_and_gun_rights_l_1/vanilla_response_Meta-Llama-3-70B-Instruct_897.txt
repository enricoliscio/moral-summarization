SUMMARY:

The article highlights the experiences of mayors who have dealt with mass shootings in their communities. The author, a mayor, notes that many cities and towns are now associated with memorials rather than monuments due to the frequency of mass shootings. The mayors have formed a "grim circle" to lead their people forward in the wake of tragedy. The author emphasizes that the solution to gun violence lies not in NRA talking points, but in empowering young people to demand action against hate speech and gun control. The article also shares the author's personal connection to cities affected by mass shootings, including Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, where their ancestors first found freedom and belonging in the US.
