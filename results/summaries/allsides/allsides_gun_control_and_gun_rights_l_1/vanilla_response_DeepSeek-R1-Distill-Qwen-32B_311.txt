Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is by a mayor, probably Eric Adams, talking about the impact of gun violence on cities and the role of mayors in addressing it. He mentions specific cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, which have experienced mass shootings. He connects these events to hate speech and easy access to firearms, especially military-grade ones. 

He also talks about the mayors' initiative to take action locally since they can't rely on Washington. The focus is on empowering young people to lead in calling out hate speech and promoting gun control. There's a personal element where he shares his family's history, showing how these issues are deeply rooted in his background. 

He mentions the Youth Summit and his Youth Council to End Gun Violence, highlighting their efforts to address gun safety and engage youth. The main message is about the need for collective action, involving young people, to create a safer nation. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by identifying the key points: mayors' struggles with gun violence, the role of hate speech, local action, youth involvement, and the personal connection to the issue. I'll make sure to include the examples of cities and the initiatives mentioned. 

Let me structure it: introduce the problem, mention the mayors' efforts, the role of young people, and the personal and historical context. Keep it concise and within the word limit. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. 

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and captures the essence of the article without getting bogged down in details. Highlight the main themes and the call to action. Make sure it's clear and impactful, reflecting the urgency of the issue.
