SUMMARY: Mayors from cities across the United States, regardless of their political affiliation, are taking action to address the deadly combination of intolerance and gun obsession that has resulted in mass shootings and countless deaths by guns in their communities. They are focusing on empowering young people to speak out against hate speech and demanding that steps be taken to keep guns out of the wrong hands. The author, a mayor himself, reflects on how these shootings have affected cities with personal significance, such as Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, and how they are now part of a fellowship of communities trying to heal from extreme gun violence. The author also emphasizes the importance of involving young people in the fight against gun violence, highlighting the work of his Youth Council to End Gun Violence. These young people are fighting against accepting a status quo where bulletproof backpacks are normalized. The author believes that by taking action and involving young people, we can create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, free from the fear of violence.
