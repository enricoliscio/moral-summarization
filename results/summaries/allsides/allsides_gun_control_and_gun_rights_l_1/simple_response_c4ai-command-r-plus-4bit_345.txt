SUMMARY: The author, a mayor, reflects on the grim reality of mass shootings and gun violence in American cities and the impact it has had on their communities. They highlight how these tragedies are driven by a toxic mix of racist ideology, hatred towards immigrants, and the dangerous accessibility of military-grade firearms. Rather than relying on ineffective NRA talking points or inaction from Washington, mayors across the political spectrum are taking matters into their own hands. The focus is on empowering young people to raise their voices against hate speech and demand action to keep weapons out of dangerous hands. The author's personal connection to affected cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, and their family history of immigration and seeking refuge in America, underscores the emotional toll of these shootings. They emphasize the need to listen to and involve young people in finding solutions to gun violence, drawing inspiration from their own Youth Council to End Gun Violence. The goal is to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, free from the fear of violence. This, the author believes, is the legacy they want to leave for future generations.
