SUMMARY:
Mayors from across the US are taking action to address the "unthinkable" tragedy of mass shootings, driven by "racist ideology" and "malice toward immigrants". They are working to empower young people to "forcefully call out hate speech" and take steps to keep weapons out of the wrong hands. The author, a mayor, reflects on their own family's history of fleeing violence and seeking freedom in the US. They acknowledge the "sorrowful fellowship" of communities affected by gun violence and emphasize the need to involve and take seriously the concerns of young people. The mayor's Youth Council to End Gun Violence is working to create a future where everyone can grow up "free, healthy, and unburdened by fear of violence". END OF SUMMARY.
