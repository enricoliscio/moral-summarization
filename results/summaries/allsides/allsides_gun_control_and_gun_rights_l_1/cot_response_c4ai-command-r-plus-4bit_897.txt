SUMMARY: In the aftermath of mass shootings, mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly nexus of intolerance, hate speech, and easy access to military-grade weapons. They are focused on empowering young people who are demanding courageous and meaningful steps to end gun violence. The author, a mayor, reflects on the personal connections to cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, where their ancestors first discovered freedom and belonging, now marred by extreme gun violence. Young people inspire the movement, seeking the same freedoms from fear and violence as previous generations. Despite adversity and heartbreak, the author remains committed to reaching for a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, leaving a legacy of courage and determination for future generations.
