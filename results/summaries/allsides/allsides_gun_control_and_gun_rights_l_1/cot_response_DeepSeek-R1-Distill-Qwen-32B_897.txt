Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed article, and they want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I have to write a summary using those words as much as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get a sense of its main points. It's about mayors dealing with gun violence and the impact on their communities. The author talks about how cities are now associated with memorials from mass shootings, and how mayors are taking action, especially focusing on young people's efforts to address gun violence and hate speech.

Now, for step one, I need to pick out the morally framed words. These are words that carry strong emotional or ethical connotations. Let me go through the article and note them down.

- Grim circle: This suggests a difficult, sorrowful situation.
- Unthinkable tragedy: Something horrible and unimaginable.
- Racist ideology: Clearly a negative moral stance.
- Malice toward immigrants: Hostility towards a group, morally wrong.
- Hate speech: Spreading hatred, which is unethical.
- Deranged individuals: Mentally unstable, leading to harmful actions.
- Military-grade firepower: Implies excessive and dangerous weapons.
- NRA talking points: Refers to the NRA's arguments, which are often seen as promoting gun rights without considering public safety.
- Deadly nexus: The dangerous connection between intolerance and guns.
- Intolerance: Prejudice against others, a moral failing.
- Obsession with guns: Excessive focus on something harmful.
- Empowering young people: Giving them strength and voice, positive.
- Righteous demands: Moral and just requests.
- Call out hate speech: Condemning harmful speech, a positive action.
- Courageous, meaningful, lasting steps: Strong positive actions.
- Keep weapons out: Preventing harm, a moral imperative.
- Terrible things: Negative events.
- Devastating loss: Tragic and harmful.
- Sorrowful fellowship: Shared grief among communities.
- Civic spirit: The community's morale and unity.
- Generation-defining challenge: A significant issue for the future.
- Bulletproof backpacks: A grim reality of normalized violence.
- Chance to grow up free, healthy, unburdened by fear: Positive aspirations.
- Adversity: Difficulties faced.
- Discouraged, heartbroken, paralyzed: Negative emotions.
- Beyond our grasp: Something hard to achieve but important.
- Everyone belongs and feels safe: A moral goal.
- Inheritance: What is passed down, implying responsibility.

Okay, I think I've got all the morally charged words. Now, I need to write a concise summary using these words as much as possible. The summary should be under 200 words, so I need to be brief but comprehensive.

I'll start by stating that mayors are facing a grim circle due to mass shootings. Mention the tragic events and the moral issues like racist ideology and hate speech. Highlight the mayors' actions, empowering young people, and their demands. Then, touch on the personal connections and the shared sorrow. Finally, emphasize the goal of a safe nation and the inheritance for future generations.

Let me structure that into a coherent summary, making sure to include the key moral points without making it too long. I'll also ensure that the summary flows well and covers all the main aspects of the article.
