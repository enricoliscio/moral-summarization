SUMMARY:
Mayors from across the US are coming together to address the "grim" reality of mass shootings and gun violence in their communities. They are taking action to empower young people who are demanding change, including calling out "hate speech" and keeping weapons out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them. The mayors are driven by a sense of "awesome" responsibility to lead their people forward in the wake of "terrible" tragedies. They are working to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, free from the "sorrowful" fellowship of communities affected by gun violence. The mayors are inspired by the "righteous" demands of young people who want to grow up free from fear of violence. They are committed to leaving a legacy of a safer, more "exceptional" nation for future generations. END OF SUMMARY.
