SUMMARY: Mayors across the United States are banding together to address the deadly nexus of intolerance, hate speech, and gun violence that has devastated many communities. From Las Vegas to Parkland, the grim reality of mass shootings has created a circle of leaders determined to take action and empower young people to demand change. The author, a mayor himself, reflects on how these tragedies could have personally affected his own family, with memories of Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso holding a special place in his history. He emphasizes the need to involve young people in the fight against gun violence, normalizing it, and creating a market for bulletproof backpacks. The goal is to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, free from the fear of violence. It is a challenging task, but one that these mayors are committed to, hoping to leave a legacy of a nation where everyone can thrive without the burden of fear.
