Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about mayors dealing with mass shootings and gun violence, especially in cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, and Parkland. It mentions how these mayors are taking action because they can't rely on Washington. They're focusing on young people's demands to address hate speech and gun control.

The author also shares personal stories about their ancestors in Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, highlighting how these places are connected through their family's history and the current issues they face. They mention the Youth Summit where young leaders, including those from the Youth Council to End Gun Violence, are working on campaigns against normalized gun violence.

The main points are: the impact of gun violence on communities, mayors' actions, the role of young people, and the author's personal connection to these issues. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key elements without getting bogged down in details.
