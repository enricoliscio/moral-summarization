SUMMARY:
Mayors from across the US are coming together to take action against gun violence, driven by racist ideology and hate speech. The "grim circle of mayors" has formed in cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, and Parkland, where mass shootings have occurred. The mayors are empowering young people to call out hate speech and take meaningful steps to keep weapons out of the wrong hands. The author, a mayor, reflects on their own family's history of fleeing violence and seeking freedom in the US. They emphasize the importance of involving young people in the solution, citing their own Youth Council to End Gun Violence. The goal is to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, free from the "normalized gun violence" that has become a devastating reality. END OF SUMMARY.
