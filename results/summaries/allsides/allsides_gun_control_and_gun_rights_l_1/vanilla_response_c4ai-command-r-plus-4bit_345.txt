SUMMARY: In the wake of mass shootings in Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, Parkland, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly combination of intolerance and gun obsession. They are focusing on empowering young people who are demanding an end to hate speech and stricter gun control. The author, a mayor himself, formed a Youth Council to End Gun Violence after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and he highlights the work of young people who are determined to create a safer future. These young leaders are fighting for the same freedoms and sense of belonging that the author's ancestors sought when they first arrived in America. The author believes that by listening to and involving young people in these efforts, we can create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe. This, he says, is the legacy he wants to leave for his daughter and future generations.
