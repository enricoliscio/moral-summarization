Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is from a mayor, talking about the impact of gun violence and hate in their communities. They mention how cities are now known for memorials instead of monuments, which sets a somber tone.

The author is a mayor who's part of a group dealing with mass shootings, which adds a personal touch. They emphasize the responsibility on local leaders since federal action is lacking. The moral aspect here is the struggle against hate and gun violence, which is tied to the author's family history, showing a personal connection.

I should highlight the mayors' actions, like empowering young people and taking initiative. The moral framing includes the call to address hate speech and gun control. Also, the mention of ancestors seeking freedom adds depth, showing a commitment to a safe nation for future generations.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on key points: the shift from monuments to memorials, the mayors' initiative, the role of young leaders, and the personal and historical context. I'll make sure to include the moral call to action against hate and gun violence, emphasizing the need for courage and unity.
