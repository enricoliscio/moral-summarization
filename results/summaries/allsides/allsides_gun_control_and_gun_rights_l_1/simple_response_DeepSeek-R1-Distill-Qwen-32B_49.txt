Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about mayors dealing with gun violence and mass shootings, especially those influenced by hate and racism. It mentions specific cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Parkland, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso. The author, who is a mayor, talks about the responsibility they have to lead their communities after such tragedies. They criticize the NRA's influence and the lack of action from Washington, instead focusing on local efforts, particularly involving young people.

The author also shares personal stories about their family's history, emphasizing the importance of safety and belonging. They mention forming a Youth Council to address gun violence and the impact of normalized gun violence on society. The moral message is about unity, taking action, and ensuring a safe future for the next generation.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, keeping the moral elements intact. I should mention the mayors' challenges, the influence of hate, the criticism of NRA and Washington, the focus on youth, and the personal stories highlighting the importance of safety and unity.

I'll structure the summary to first address the issue of gun violence and mayors' roles, then touch on the personal and historical context, and finally the call to action and hope for the future. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll ensure each key point is covered succinctly.
