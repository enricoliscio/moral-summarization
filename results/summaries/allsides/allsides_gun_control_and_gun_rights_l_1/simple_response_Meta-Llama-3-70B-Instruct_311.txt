SUMMARY:

The author, a mayor, reflects on the grim reality of mass shootings in American cities and towns, which have become synonymous with memorials rather than monuments. The mayors, from diverse political backgrounds, are taking action to empower young people to demand change, as they are tired of the NRA's talking points and the lack of leadership from Washington. The author shares personal connections to cities affected by gun violence, such as Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, where their ancestors found freedom and belonging. They emphasize the importance of involving young people in the conversation, citing their own Youth Council to End Gun Violence, which advises on gun safety issues. The author's moral framing is clear: the country must confront the deadly nexus between intolerance and gun obsession to ensure a safe and inclusive nation for all, where everyone belongs and feels safe. This is the inheritance they want to leave for future generations.
