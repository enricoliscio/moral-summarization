SUMMARY: In the wake of mass shootings and pervasive gun violence, mayors from various cities and political backgrounds are taking matters into their own hands. They are uniting to address the toxic interplay between hate speech, intolerance, and the obsession with guns that fuels devastating loss of lives. The author, a mayor himself, reflects on how these tragedies could have struck his own family, with personal connections to cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso. He emphasizes the need to empower young people, who demand sensible actions against hate speech and gun accessibility. Through initiatives like the Youth Council to End Gun Violence, young leaders are actively engaged in shaping policies for a safer future. The mayor concludes that the pursuit of a nation where everyone feels safe and included is a moral obligation to honor the sacrifices of our ancestors and secure a better inheritance for future generations.
