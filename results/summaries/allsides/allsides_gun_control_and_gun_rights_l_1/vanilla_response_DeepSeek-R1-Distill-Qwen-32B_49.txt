Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article. The article is from CNN and it's about mayors dealing with mass shootings and their response. The user wants the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It talks about how many cities are now associated with memorials from mass shootings. Mayors are dealing with gun violence, and some shootings are driven by hate and racism. The article mentions specific cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Parkland, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso. The author, who seems to be a mayor, is emphasizing the need for action beyond Washington, involving young people in solutions.

I should identify the main points: the impact of mass shootings on cities, the role of mayors, the connection to hate and gun access, and the focus on youth involvement. I need to condense these points into a concise summary under 200 words.

I also notice the author has personal connections to these cities, which adds a heartfelt element. That should be included to show the emotional weight of the issue.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the problem, then the mayors' response, the call for action, and the involvement of young people. I'll make sure to mention the specific cities and the emotional aspect from the author's perspective.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, avoiding unnecessary details. Once the summary is drafted, I'll place it between the specified tokens.

Alright, time to put it all together.
