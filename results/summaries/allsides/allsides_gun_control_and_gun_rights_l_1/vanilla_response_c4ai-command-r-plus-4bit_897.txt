SUMMARY: In the aftermath of mass shootings, mayors from cities across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly combination of intolerance and easy access to military-grade firearms. They are focusing on empowering young people to speak out against hate speech and advocating for stronger gun control measures. The author, a mayor himself, reflects on how cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso hold a special place in his family history and are now part of a sorrowful fellowship of communities recovering from extreme gun violence. The author also highlights the importance of involving young people in the fight against gun violence and shares his experience with the Youth Council to End Gun Violence, which advises him on gun safety and youth engagement. He emphasizes the similarities between the aspirations of today's young people and those of his ancestors who sought freedom and safety in America. The author calls for continued efforts to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, dedicating his work to his daughter and future generations.
