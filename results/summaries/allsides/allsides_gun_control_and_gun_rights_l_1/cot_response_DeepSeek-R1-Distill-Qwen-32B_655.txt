Alright, so the user has given me a task where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The goal is to summarize a provided news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to perform two main steps. The first step is to identify all the single words in the article that are morally framed. I should list each of these words with a bullet point, starting with an asterisk. The second step is to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be no longer than 200 words and should be clearly marked with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Looking at the article, it's about mayors dealing with gun violence and hate crimes, emphasizing the moral responsibility and the need for action. The author, who seems to be a mayor, is highlighting the impact of gun violence on communities and the role of young people in driving change.

For the first step, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "grimmest," "unthinkable," "racist," "malice," "hate," "deranged," "agonizing," "responsibility," "echo chamber," "courageous," "meaningful," "righteous," "terrible," "needless," "devastating," "freedom," "belonging," "exceptional," "sorrowful," "civic," "adversity," "discouraged," "heartbroken," "paralyzed," "chance," "free," "healthy," "unburdened," "fear," "belong," "safe," "inheritance," "everything," "greatest," and "Earth." These words all carry strong moral implications and are central to the author's argument.

Next, for the summary, I need to encapsulate the main points while using as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should reflect the author's concern about gun violence, the role of mayors taking action, the importance of addressing hate speech, and the involvement of young people in driving change. It should also touch on the personal connections to the cities affected and the hope for a safer future.

I need to ensure that the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. I'll start by stating the problem of gun violence, mention the mayors' actions, the need to address hate speech, involve young people, and conclude with the hope for a better future.

I should also make sure that the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key points are covered, maintaining the moral tone of the original article.
