SUMMARY:

The article highlights the struggles of mayors in the US who have to lead their communities after mass shootings. The author, a mayor themselves, notes that many mayors have dealt with scores of deaths by guns in their communities. They criticize the NRA's talking points and the lack of leadership from Washington in addressing the deadly nexus between intolerance and gun obsession. Instead, mayors are taking action themselves, focusing on empowering young people to call out hate speech and take steps to keep weapons out of the wrong hands. The author shares personal connections to cities affected by mass shootings, including Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, and emphasizes the importance of involving young people in finding solutions to gun violence. They mention their own Youth Council to End Gun Violence, which advises on gun safety and engages young people in the issue.
