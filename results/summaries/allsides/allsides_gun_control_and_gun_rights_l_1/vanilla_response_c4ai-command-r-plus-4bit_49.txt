SUMMARY: The article discusses the issue of gun violence in the United States and the impact it has had on various cities and towns, creating a "grim circle of mayors" who have to lead their communities through the aftermath of mass shootings. The author, a mayor themselves, emphasizes the connection between hate speech, intolerance, and easy access to military-grade weapons as contributing factors to the increasing incidents of gun violence. They criticize the NRA's talking points and the lack of leadership from Washington, highlighting instead the actions of mayors from across the political spectrum who are taking matters into their own hands. The mayor also shares personal connections to some of the affected cities, such as Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, and reflects on the American dream sought by their ancestors who immigrated to the country. The article concludes with a call to involve young people in the fight against gun violence and a commitment to creating a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe.
