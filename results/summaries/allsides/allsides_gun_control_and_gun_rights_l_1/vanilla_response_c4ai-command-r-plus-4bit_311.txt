SUMMARY: In the aftermath of mass shootings, the names of cities and towns are now more closely associated with memorials than monuments. Mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly nexus between intolerance and gun obsession, focusing on empowering young people who demand action against hate speech and gun violence. The author, a mayor, reflects on how the recent shootings in Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso hold a special place in their family history and are now part of a sorrowful fellowship of communities trying to heal from extreme gun violence. The author highlights the importance of involving young people in the fight against gun violence and shares their experience with the Youth Council to End Gun Violence. The young people inspiring the author want the same things as the author's ancestors: a chance to grow up free, healthy, and without fear of violence. The author calls for continued efforts to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, leaving a better future for the next generations.
