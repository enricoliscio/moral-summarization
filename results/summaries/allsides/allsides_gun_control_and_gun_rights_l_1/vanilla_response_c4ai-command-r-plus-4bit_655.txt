SUMMARY: In the wake of mass shootings in Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, Parkland, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly combination of intolerance and easy access to military-grade firearms. The author, a mayor themselves, emphasizes the need to empower young people and take their concerns and ideas seriously in the fight against gun violence. They share their personal connection to these cities and their ancestors' journeys to the United States in search of freedom and safety. The mayor highlights their own Youth Council to End Gun Violence and the recent US Conference of Mayors Youth Summit as examples of involving young people in finding solutions. They call for a rejection of the status quo that normalizes gun violence and markets bulletproof backpacks for children. The article concludes with a reflection on the shared desire for a nation free from fear and violence, and the commitment to leave a safer inheritance for future generations.
