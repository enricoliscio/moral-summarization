SUMMARY: In the aftermath of mass shootings, mayors of cities and towns are faced with the moral responsibility of leading their communities forward. The senseless acts of gun violence driven by racist ideology, malice towards immigrants, and hate speech have created a grim circle of communities trying to heal. Mayors across the political spectrum are taking action, focusing on empowering young people who demand courageous and meaningful steps to address gun violence and intolerance. The author reflects on how their family history is connected to cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, which have experienced tragic shootings. They emphasize the importance of listening to young people's concerns and ideas, drawing inspiration from their own Youth Council to End Gun Violence. The author calls for a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe, free from the fear of violence, and acknowledges the legacy of those who risked everything to build a better country. 

END OF SUMMARY.
