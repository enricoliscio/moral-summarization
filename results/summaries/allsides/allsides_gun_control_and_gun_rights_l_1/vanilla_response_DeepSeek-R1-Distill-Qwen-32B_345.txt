Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is by a mayor, probably Eric Adams, talking about the impact of gun violence on cities and the role of mayors in addressing it. He mentions several cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, and Parkland, which have all experienced mass shootings. He's highlighting how mayors are dealing with the aftermath and the responsibilities that come with it, especially when these incidents are driven by hate and racism.

He talks about how mayors from various political backgrounds are taking action themselves because they can't rely on Washington. They're focusing on empowering young people to lead the way in addressing gun violence and hate speech. He also shares personal stories about his ancestors and how their experiences tie into the current issues of gun violence and immigration.

The article emphasizes the importance of involving young people in finding solutions and creating a safer future. The mayor mentions forming a Youth Council to End Gun Violence and how these young leaders are pushing for change. He ends by expressing hope for a future where everyone feels safe and belongs, tying it back to his family's history and the values of freedom and safety.

So, the main points are: the burden on mayors dealing with gun violence, the role of young people in leading change, personal connections to the issue, and the hope for a safer America. I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words.
