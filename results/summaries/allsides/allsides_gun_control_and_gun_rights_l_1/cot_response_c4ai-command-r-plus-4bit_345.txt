SUMMARY: In the wake of mass shootings and extreme gun violence in cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, Parkland, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly intersection of intolerance and gun obsession. They are focusing on empowering young people, who demand that hate speech be called out and that steps be taken to keep guns out of the wrong hands. The author, a mayor himself, reflects on how these tragedies could have impacted his own family, with personal connections to some of the affected communities. He emphasizes the importance of listening to and involving young people in the fight against gun violence, drawing inspiration from his Youth Council to End Gun Violence. The youth's demands are righteous, and their goal is to grow up free from fear and violence, just as the author's ancestors did when they first arrived in America. The author acknowledges the adversity and heartbreak that comes with the constant news of gun violence but encourages everyone to keep reaching for a safer and more inclusive nation, leaving a better future for the next generations.
