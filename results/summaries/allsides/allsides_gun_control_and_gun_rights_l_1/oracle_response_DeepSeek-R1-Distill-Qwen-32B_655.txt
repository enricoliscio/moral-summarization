Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should focus on those. The article talks about mayors dealing with gun violence and their efforts to take action. I should highlight the emotional impact and the proactive steps they're taking, especially involving young people. I'll need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise yet captures the essence. Let me structure it by first addressing the issue, then the mayors' actions, and finally the call to involve youth. That should cover the moral elements effectively.
