Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is a mayor discussing the impact of mass shootings and gun violence on communities. They mention cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Parkland, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, highlighting the personal and historical connections to these places. The author emphasizes the responsibility of mayors to take action, especially in the face of hate speech and easy access to firearms. They also talk about involving young people in efforts to combat gun violence.

I should identify the key morally framed words: shootings, deaths, tragedy, agonizing, violence, driven, malice, speech, broadcast, access, wreak, destroy, intolerance, obsession, action, empowering, call, steps, keep, happen, mourning, loss, killed, formed, shooting, advise, fight, accepting, feel, feels.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. I'll focus on the main themes: the burden on mayors, the role of hate and gun access, the impact on communities, and the involvement of young people. I'll structure it to flow from the problem to the actions being taken, ensuring the moral tone is maintained.

Let me start by stating the issue: cities dealing with mass shootings and gun violence. Then, mention the mayors' responsibility and the factors driving the violence. Next, highlight the personal and historical connections to affected cities. Finally, discuss the efforts to empower young people and take action against hate and gun proliferation.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the necessary moral language. I'll make sure each sentence ties back to the moral framing without losing the essence of the article.
