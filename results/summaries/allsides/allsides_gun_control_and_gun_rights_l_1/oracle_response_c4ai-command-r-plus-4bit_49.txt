SUMMARY: In the aftermath of mass shootings, mayors from cities across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly nexus between intolerance, hate speech, and gun violence. They are empowering young people to demand action against hate speech and to keep guns out of the wrong hands. The author, a mayor, reflects on how cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso hold a special place in their history, but are now part of a sorrowful fellowship of communities trying to heal from extreme gun violence. The author formed a Youth Council to End Gun Violence after the Stoneman Douglas shooting and is working with young leaders to fight against accepting a status quo that normalizes gun violence and creates a market for bulletproof backpacks. The mayor owes it to their ancestors, who risked everything to build a better life, to leave a safer nation for their children.
