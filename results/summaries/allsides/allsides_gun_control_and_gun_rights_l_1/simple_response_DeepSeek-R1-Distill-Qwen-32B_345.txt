Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about mayors dealing with gun violence and mass shootings. It mentions how cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino, and Parkland are now associated with memorials instead of monuments. The mayors are struggling with the aftermath of these tragedies, especially when they're driven by racism, hate towards immigrants, and hate speech from powerful places. The author criticizes the NRA's influence and the lack of leadership from Washington. Mayors are taking action themselves, focusing on empowering young people to call out hate and reduce gun access. 

The author also shares personal stories about their family's history, connecting it to the current issues, emphasizing the need to protect future generations. They mention a Youth Summit where young leaders are advising on gun safety, highlighting their determination to change the status quo. The conclusion is about striving for a nation where everyone feels safe, tying it back to the author's family's journey and hopes for their daughter.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral elements like the struggle against hate, empowerment of youth, and the author's personal connection. I'll make sure to include the mayors' actions, the criticism of NRA and Washington, and the focus on young people's role. Also, the personal stories add emotional weight, so they should be mentioned briefly.

Let me structure it: start with the mayors' challenge, mention the causes of violence, criticism of NRA and Washington, then the youth empowerment, personal stories, and the goal for a safe nation. Keep it concise but cover all key points.
