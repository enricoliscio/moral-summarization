SUMMARY: Mayors from cities and towns across the United States are banding together to address the issue of mass shootings and gun violence in their communities. The author, a mayor himself, highlights the grim reality of how gun violence has impacted so many places, from Las Vegas to Orlando, San Bernardino to Parkland, and more recently, Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso. He laments how these tragic events are driven by racist ideology, malice, and hate speech, and how they have been made worse by easy access to military-grade firearms. Rather than waiting for leadership from Washington, mayors are taking action themselves, focusing on empowering young people and giving them a voice in the fight against gun violence. The author reflects on how these shootings hit close to home, with personal connections to the affected communities and a family history of fleeing violence and seeking a safer life in America. He emphasizes the importance of listening to and involving young people in finding solutions, drawing inspiration from their determination to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe. The author concludes that, despite the challenges and heartbreak, it is crucial to keep reaching for a safer future, just as his ancestors did when they first came to America.
