SUMMARY:
Mayors from across the US are coming together to address the "grim circle" of mass shootings, driven by "racist ideology" and "malice" towards immigrants. They are taking action to empower young people, who are demanding an end to "hate speech" and the proliferation of weapons. The mayors are working to keep communities safe from "extreme gun violence" and to create a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe. The author, a mayor, reflects on their own family's history, from fleeing anti-Semitic violence to finding freedom in the US. They emphasize the importance of involving young people in the fight against gun violence, and of creating a nation where everyone can grow up "free, healthy, and unburdened by fear of violence."
