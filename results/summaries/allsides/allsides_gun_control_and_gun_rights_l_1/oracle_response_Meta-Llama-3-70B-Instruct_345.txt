SUMMARY:

The author, a mayor, reflects on the grim reality of mass shootings in various cities and towns, which have become synonymous with memorials rather than monuments. The mayors, who have dealt with scores of deaths by guns, are now part of a "grim circle" forced to lead their people forward in the wake of unthinkable tragedy. The author emphasizes that these bursts of violence are often driven by racist ideology, malice toward immigrants, and hate speech broadcast from the halls of power. The mayors are taking action themselves, focusing on empowering young people who demand an end to hate speech and meaningful steps to keep weapons out of the wrong hands. The author's personal connection to the affected cities makes the tragedy even more agonizing, and they believe that involving young people in the solution is crucial to creating a safer nation where everyone belongs and feels safe.
