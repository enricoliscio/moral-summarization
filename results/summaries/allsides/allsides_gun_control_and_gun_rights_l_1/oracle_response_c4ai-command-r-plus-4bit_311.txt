SUMMARY: Mayors from across the political spectrum are taking action to address the deadly nexus between intolerance, hate speech, and gun violence. They are no longer counting on leadership from Washington, but instead, are focusing on empowering young people to raise their concerns and demand change. The author, a mayor himself, reflects on how gun violence has impacted his life and the lives of his ancestors, with personal connections to cities like Gilroy, Dayton, and El Paso, which have experienced mass shootings. He emphasizes the need to listen to and involve young people in the fight against gun violence and intolerance, as they are armed only with righteous demands for a safer future. The author's own Youth Council to End Gun Violence is a testament to this, with students advising him on issues of gun safety and engagement. Despite the adversity and heartbreak caused by gun violence and hate, the author remains hopeful that by reaching for what seems beyond grasp, a nation where everyone belongs and feels safe can be achieved. This is the inheritance he wants to leave for his daughter, honoring the legacy of those who came before.
