SUMMARY:

The article expresses schadenfreude towards Senate Democrats who regret their decision to weaken the filibuster, allowing President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons admit they regret their vote, but only because it will now benefit Trump, not because they recognize the error of their majoritarianism and power grabs. The author argues that Democrats didn't destroy the filibuster for a grand ideological purpose, but for short-term political gains. They ignored the importance of tradition, norms, and process, which are essential for preventing absolute power and maintaining checks and balances. The article criticizes Democrats for their recklessness and lack of courage to stand for process and stability over partisanship. The author warns that this kind of arms race sets dangerous precedents and destroys the very foundations of the system. The nation should realize the importance of preserving process and stability.
