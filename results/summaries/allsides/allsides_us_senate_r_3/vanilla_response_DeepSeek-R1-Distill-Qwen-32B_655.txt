Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Senate Democrats regretting the nuclear option they used to weaken the filibuster. They're feeling the consequences now with Trump's nominations. 

Hmm, the author is pointing out that Democrats changed the rules for short-term gains, which backfired. They mention specific senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley, who now regret their decision. The article also criticizes the Democrats for not valuing tradition and checks and balances, leading to a cycle of recklessness in Washington.

I should include the main points: the regret from Democrats, the impact on Trump's nominations, the short-term political gains leading to long-term issues, and the critique of the nuclear option's consequences. Also, the mention of liberals trying to bypass Senate procedures adds to the cycle of arms race in politics.

Need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to highlight the regret, the consequences, and the broader implications of their actions. I'll structure it to first state the regret, then explain why they did it, the current impact, and the critique of their decision. 

Let me draft that. Make sure to mention the nuclear option, the filibuster, the senators involved, and the long-term effects on Senate rules. Also, note that the changes are unlikely to be reversed, emphasizing the cycle of partisanship. 

I think that's a solid summary. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

The article criticizes Democrats for prioritizing short-term political gains over the long-term stability of Senate traditions and checks and balances. It highlights the irony that Democrats, who once warned against weakening the filibuster, now face the consequences of their own actions. The piece also notes that the changes to Senate rules are unlikely to be reversed, as future majorities would likely exploit the same process.
