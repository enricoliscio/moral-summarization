Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Senate Democrats regretting the "nuclear option" after Trump's election. The author uses words like "recklessness," "destroying," and "abuses" to highlight the moral implications.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those morally framed words as possible. The key points are the Democrats' regret, the consequences of weakening the filibuster, and the broader implications for checks and balances. I should also mention the short-term political gains and the potential for future abuse by either party.

I'll start by noting the Democrats' regret and the author's schadenfreude. Then, I'll explain how the nuclear option removed the filibuster, making it easier for Trump to appoint his nominees. I'll include the author's criticism of Democrats for prioritizing power over process and the long-term damage to the system. Finally, I'll touch on the arms race in Senate procedures and the importance of stability over partisanship.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral terms are prominent. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and retains the author's critical tone.

SUMMARY: The author reflects on Senate Democrats' regret over eliminating the filibuster, a decision they now see as a mistake. By "blowing up" the filibuster, Democrats enabled a "reckless" power grab, weakening the Senate's ability to "slow down nominees" and uphold "checks and balances." The author criticizes the move as a short-term political gain, questioning whether it was worth empowering future Republican presidents like Trump. Democrats, once vocal about preserving the filibuster to "prevent absolute power," now face the consequences of their "majoritarianism." The author warns that such "recklessness" sets dangerous precedents, as both parties may exploit the system for their advantage. The nuclear option, which "destroyed" a key safeguard, is unlikely to be reversed, leaving the Senate vulnerable to "abuses" and "process" over "stability." The author laments the loss of tradition and norms, emphasizing that "function" and "responding" to challenges require a stable system, not a partisan "arms race." END OF SUMMARY.
