Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Senate Democrats regretting the "nuclear option" they used to eliminate the filibuster. They did this a few years ago, and now they're feeling the consequences as Trump is using the same process to appoint his nominees. The author seems critical of their decision, highlighting that they didn't regret it for the sake of checks and balances but because it's now benefiting the Republicans.

I should note that the author is pointing out the irony and the shortsightedness of the Democrats' move. They used the nuclear option for short-term gains, thinking it would help Obama's administration, but it's now backfiring. The author also mentions that the Democrats didn't really need to change the rules because Obama had already made significant changes, like passing major legislation and appointing justices without opposition.

The moral framing here is about the dangers of recklessness and the erosion of democratic norms. The author is warning that such power plays create an arms race, leading to instability and potential future problems. It's a cautionary tale about how both parties can exploit the system when in power, leading to a breakdown of checks and balances.

I need to make sure the summary captures this critique, the regret from the Democrats, the consequences of their actions, and the broader implications for democracy. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the original's critical tone towards the Democrats' decision and its impact on political norms.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Senate Democrats' decision to eliminate the filibuster via the "nuclear option," a move now haunting them as President-elect Trump uses the same process to appoint his nominees. The author highlights the irony that Democrats, who once warned of the dangers of weakening checks and balances, now regret their decision as it empowers Republicans. The change was driven by short-term political gains, not ideological principle, and Democrats are now reaping the consequences. The author argues that the filibuster served as a crucial safeguard against unchecked power, and its removal sets a dangerous precedent, leading to a potential arms race in Senate procedures. The piece warns of the long-term consequences of recklessness in Washington, where both parties exploit power for their gain, eroding democratic norms and stability. END OF SUMMARY.
