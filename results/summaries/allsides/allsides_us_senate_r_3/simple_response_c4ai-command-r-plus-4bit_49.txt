SUMMARY: Democrats now regret their decision to blow up the filibuster a few years ago as President-elect Donald Trump names his Cabinet and judges. Their actions, led by Senator Harry Reid, have set a dangerous precedent, with no regard for the traditions, norms, and processes that provide stability and balance in Washington, D.C. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware now regrets his vote to weaken the filibuster, realizing it could have served as a speed bump to slow down Trump's nominees. However, their regret is not for their embrace of majoritarianism and power grabs, but for the fact that Trump can now operate under the rules they set.

The filibuster was eliminated for short-term political gains, and Democrats like Senator Jeff Merkley justified it by claiming that it was necessary for the executive branch to function. Liberal pundits like Paul Krugman even claimed that the filibuster would destroy America. In reality, Obama had already passed significant legislation and appointed liberal Supreme Court justices despite the filibuster. The destruction of the filibuster has disrupted the checks and balances put in place by the Founding Fathers, and it is unlikely that any majority will restore it or stand up for process and stability over partisan gains. This recklessness and disregard for tradition set a dangerous precedent, and it remains to be seen if the nation will recognize the consequences of these actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
