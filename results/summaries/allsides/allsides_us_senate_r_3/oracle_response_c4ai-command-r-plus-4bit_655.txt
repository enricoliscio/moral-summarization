SUMMARY: A CNN piece highlights the regrets of Senate Democrats who, in a power grab, blew up the filibuster a few years ago and now face the consequences as President-elect Donald Trump makes his Cabinet and judge nominations. Their actions weakened the system of checks and balances intended to prevent absolute power by any one branch of government. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware now regrets his vote to weaken the filibuster, acknowledging that it would have been a valuable speed bump to slow down nominees. The Democrats' actions were driven by short-term political gains rather than any grand ideological purpose. The liberal punditry, including Paul Krugman, also played a role in hammering the filibuster, falsely claiming that it would destroy America. Despite warnings from Senator Harry Reid and others about the potential destruction of checks and balances, the filibuster was eliminated from some Senate debates. These changes are likely permanent as no majority would willingly restore power to their opponents or restrict their own abilities. Progressives hold an enduring contempt for the filibuster and federalism, and their reckless actions have set dangerous precedents.
END OF SUMMARY.
