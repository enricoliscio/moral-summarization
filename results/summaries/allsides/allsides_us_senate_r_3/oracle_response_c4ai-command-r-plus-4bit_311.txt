SUMMARY: Senate Democrats, who voted to weaken the filibuster years ago, now regret their decision as they are powerless to stop President-elect Donald Trump's nominees. Their recklessness has led to further recklessness in Washington, D.C., as they set a precedent that prioritizes short-term political gains over process and stability. By blowing up the filibuster, Democrats destroyed the checks and balances put in place by the Founding Fathers to prevent absolute power by any one branch of government. This power grab has come back to haunt them, as Trump will now be able to operate under the rules they set. While some Democrats express regret, it is not for their abandonment of federalism and majoritarianism, but for the fact that their actions have enabled Trump. Progressives hold an enduring contempt for the filibuster and federalism, and their willingness to destroy the very institutions that ensure the functioning of our democracy sets a dangerous precedent. It remains to be seen if the nation will recognize the consequences of their actions and work to restore the filibuster and the balance of power it ensures.
END OF SUMMARY.
