SUMMARY: Senate Democrats, who voted to weaken the filibuster a few years ago, now regret their decision as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to name his Cabinet and judges. The filibuster, a parliamentary procedure that required a supermajority of 60 votes to advance legislation, acted as a "speed bump" and "emergency brake" to slow down and block nominations. By eliminating it, Democrats engaged in a power grab, prioritizing short-term political gains over the stability and checks and balances that the filibuster provided. Their recklessness has now come back to haunt them as Trump will be able to operate under the same rules they set. While some Democrats express regret, they do so not out of a sense of moral duty or respect for process, but because they fear the consequences of their own actions. This episode serves as a cautionary tale of the dangers of partisan majoritarianism and the enduring contempt for federalism. It is unlikely that the filibuster will ever be restored, and the arms race between the parties sets dangerous precedents.
END OF SUMMARY.
