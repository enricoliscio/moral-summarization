SUMMARY:

The article expresses schadenfreude towards Senate Democrats who now regret their decision to "blow up" the filibuster, allowing President-elect Donald Trump to easily appoint his Cabinet and judges. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons admit to regretting their vote, but only because it will enable Trump to operate with unchecked power, not because they regret their "reckless" decision to undermine the filibuster. The article argues that Democrats' short-term political gains have led to "destroying" checks and balances, and that their "power grabs" will have long-term consequences. The author criticizes Democrats for their "majoritarianism" and for not valuing tradition, norms, and process. The article concludes that the changes made to the filibuster will likely never be reversed, and that the "arms race" of exploiting Senate procedures will set dangerous precedents.
