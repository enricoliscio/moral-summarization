SUMMARY:

The article discusses how Senate Democrats, including Sen. Chris Coons, are now regretting their decision to weaken the filibuster three years ago, allowing President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his Cabinet and judicial nominees. Democrats had used the "nuclear option" to change Senate rules, allowing federal judicial nominees and executive-office appointments to be confirmed with a simple majority. However, they now realize that this decision will enable Trump to operate with minimal opposition. The article argues that Democrats didn't make this change for ideological reasons, but for short-term political gains. It also criticizes liberal pundits, such as Paul Krugman, who had claimed that the filibuster would destroy America. The article concludes that this decision has set a dangerous precedent, allowing each party to undermine checks and balances when in power.
