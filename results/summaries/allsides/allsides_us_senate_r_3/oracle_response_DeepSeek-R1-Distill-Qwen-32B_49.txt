Okay, so I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about the Senate Democrats regretting their decision to eliminate the filibuster, which they did to allow President Obama's nominees to pass with a simple majority. Now, with Trump in office, they're seeing the consequences of that move.

The author uses a lot of morally charged words like "recklessness," "destroying," "checks and balances," and "abuses." I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these as possible without losing the essence.

I should start by stating that Senate Democrats regret their decision to eliminate the filibuster. Then, mention the consequences, like Trump being able to appoint his nominees without opposition. Highlight the author's point that they didn't regret the power grab itself but the fact that it's now being used against them.

I should also touch on the short-term political gains versus the long-term damage to the system. Maybe include something about the arms race in Senate procedures and the precedent it sets. Finally, end with the idea that this sets a dangerous precedent for future majorities.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point flows logically and includes the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Senate Democrats' regret over their decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they now see as reckless. By weakening the filibuster, they enabled President Trump to appoint his nominees without opposition, a consequence they now rue. The author criticizes the Democrats for prioritizing short-term political gains over the long-term stability of the system. The filibuster, once seen as a check against absolute power, is now gone, and the author warns that this sets a dangerous precedent. Progressives, who have historically contemptuously viewed the filibuster and federalism, are now seeking ways to exploit Senate procedures for their own ends, creating an arms race that threatens the balance of power. The author emphasizes that such recklessness in Washington, where winning is the ideology, undermines the very checks and balances that ensure the nation can function and respond to challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
