SUMMARY: In the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet and judicial nominee selections, Senate Democrats who voted to weaken the filibuster a few years ago now face regret and schadenfreude. They chose short-term political gains over process and stability, and now face the consequences of their power grab. The filibuster, a speed bump or emergency brake, was weakened by Senator Harry Reid and others who valued majoritarianism and power over tradition, norms, and process. This recklessness begets more recklessness, as the American people rejected unchecked power grabs by Democrats and elected Trump. Now, the same Democrats regret their vote, not because they value process, but because they fear Trump will operate under the rules they set. Progressives hold contempt for the filibuster and federalism, and their arms race to load the Supreme Court sets a dangerous precedent. The nation must recognize the importance of checks and balances to prevent absolute power and partisan wins.
END OF SUMMARY.
