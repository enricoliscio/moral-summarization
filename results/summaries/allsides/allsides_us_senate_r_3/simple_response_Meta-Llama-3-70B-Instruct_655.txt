SUMMARY:

The article critiques Senate Democrats who, in 2013, voted to weaken the filibuster, allowing federal judicial nominees and executive-office appointments to be confirmed with a simple majority. Now, they regret their decision as it enables President-elect Donald Trump to easily appoint his Cabinet and judges. The author argues that Democrats didn't make this change for ideological purposes, but for short-term political gains. They ignored the importance of tradition, norms, and process in maintaining checks and balances. The article notes that liberal pundits, like Paul Krugman, also advocated for the filibuster's demise, claiming it would "destroy America." The author concludes that the changes will likely never be reversed, and that the pursuit of power and partisanship will continue to erode the system's stability.
