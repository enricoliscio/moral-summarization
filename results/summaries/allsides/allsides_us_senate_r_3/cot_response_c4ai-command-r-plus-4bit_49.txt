SUMMARY:
In a recent CNN piece, Senate Democrats are expressing regret for their decision to weaken the filibuster a few years ago, as it now allows President-elect Donald Trump to make Cabinet and judicial nominations with ease. This decision, driven by short-term political gains and a disregard for tradition, norms, and process, has ultimately backfired. The article argues that the filibuster was an important speed bump and potential emergency brake in the confirmation process, and that weakening it has set a dangerous precedent. It highlights the recklessness and power grabs of both Democrats and Republicans, with the latter now facing the consequences of their actions. The piece also criticizes the liberal punditry's previous attacks on the filibuster and the Electoral College, and warns against the contempt for federalism and the enduring arms race between the parties. The author laments the likely irreversibility of these changes and the lack of courage to stand for process and stability over partisanship gain.
