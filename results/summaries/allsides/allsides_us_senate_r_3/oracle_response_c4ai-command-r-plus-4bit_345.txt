SUMMARY: It's no lie that the recent CNN piece on Senate Democrats' regret over their use of the "nuclear option" to blow up the filibuster induced schadenfreude in many. Years ago, these Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid, recklessly weakened the filibuster and destroyed the checks and balances our Founding Fathers put in place to prevent the abuse of power by any one branch of government. Their short-sighted power grab was done purely for short-term political gains, and now they regret it as President-elect Donald Trump uses the same majoritarian tactics to push through his nominees.

The filibuster was always an important speed bump and emergency brake in the confirmation process, ensuring stability and preventing absolute power in the hands of one party. Unfortunately, the damage has been done, and it is unlikely that any future majority will restore the filibuster or refrain from using the nuclear option to push through their agenda. This sets a dangerous precedent, and it remains to be seen if the nation will recognize the importance of process and stability over partisanship. End of summary.
