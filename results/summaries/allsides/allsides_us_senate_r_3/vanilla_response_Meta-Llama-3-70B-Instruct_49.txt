SUMMARY:

The article discusses how Senate Democrats, who previously voted to weaken the filibuster, now regret their decision as it allows President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees and judges. Democrats, such as Sen. Chris Coons, are quoted as saying they regret their vote, realizing that the filibuster would have been a "terrific speed bump" to slow down nominees. The article argues that Democrats didn't change the rules for ideological purposes, but for short-term political gains. It also criticizes liberal pundits, such as Paul Krugman, who previously claimed that the filibuster would destroy America. The article concludes that the changes to the filibuster will likely never be reversed and that the arms race between parties sets dangerous precedents.
