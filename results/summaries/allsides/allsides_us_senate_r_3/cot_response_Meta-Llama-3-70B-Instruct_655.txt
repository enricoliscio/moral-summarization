SUMMARY:
The article discusses how Senate Democrats, who previously weakened the filibuster, now regret their decision as it allows President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees. Democrats, such as Sen. Chris Coons, admit to regretting their vote, but not because they believe in the importance of tradition and norms, rather because they fear Trump's power. The article argues that Democrats' short-term political gains have led to "recklessness" and "power grabs" in Washington, D.C. It also criticizes liberal pundits, like Paul Krugman, who claimed the filibuster would "destroy America." The article concludes that the changes made to the filibuster will likely never be reversed, and that the "arms race" of exploiting Senate procedures sets "dangerous precedents."
