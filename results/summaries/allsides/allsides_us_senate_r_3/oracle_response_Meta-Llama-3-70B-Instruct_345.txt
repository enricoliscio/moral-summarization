SUMMARY:

The article critiques Senate Democrats for their past decision to weaken the filibuster, which has now come back to haunt them as President-elect Donald Trump names his Cabinet and judges. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware are now regretful of their vote, realizing that it would have been a "terrific speed bump" to slow down nominees. However, they don't regret their vote for majoritarianism or power grabs, but rather that Trump will now be able to operate under the rules they set for themselves. The article argues that Democrats didn't use a parliamentary procedure to change the rules for some grand ideological purpose, but for short-term political gains. This recklessness has led to a dangerous precedent, destroying checks and balances and paving the way for absolute power. The article concludes that the nation should realize the importance of process and stability over partisanship gains.
