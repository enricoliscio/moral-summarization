SUMMARY: Schadenfreude is experienced as Democrats who voted to weaken the filibuster now regret their decision as President-elect Donald Trump names his Cabinet and judges. The filibuster was a speed bump that could have slowed down Trump's nominees, but instead, Democrats chose power grabs and majoritarianism. They changed the rules for short-term political gains, and now face the consequences as Trump operates under the rules they set. The filibuster was an important check and balance, and its weakening by Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons and Sen. Harry Reid set a dangerous precedent. Progressives hold contempt for the filibuster and federalism, and their recklessness has led to the current situation. The American people had already rejected the Democrats' extreme agenda, but they refused to accept it and continued to push for more power. Now, the nation faces the consequences of their actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
