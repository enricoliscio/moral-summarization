SUMMARY:

The article expresses schadenfreude towards Senate Democrats who regret their decision to weaken the filibuster, allowing President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees. Democrats, including Sen. Chris Coons, now realize that their short-term political gains have led to long-term consequences, enabling Trump to operate with minimal opposition. The article argues that Democrats didn't abolish the filibuster for ideological purposes, but for personal gains, citing examples such as confirming left-wing populists to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The author criticizes liberal pundits, including Paul Krugman, who previously advocated for abolishing the filibuster, claiming it would destroy America. The article concludes that the changes made to the filibuster will likely never be reversed, as politicians prioritize partisanship over process and stability.
