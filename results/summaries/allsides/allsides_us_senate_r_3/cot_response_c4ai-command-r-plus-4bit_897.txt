SUMMARY:
Democrats are now facing the consequences of their own recklessness in regards to the filibuster. Their decision to weaken the filibuster for short-term political gains has now backfired as President-elect Donald Trump will be able to operate under the same rules they set. This power grab has destroyed the checks and balances put in place by the Founding Fathers to prevent absolute power by any one branch. While some Democrats regret their decision, it is unlikely that the filibuster will be restored anytime soon. Progressives, in particular, hold contempt for federalism and the filibuster, and continue to pursue their ideological agenda regardless of the consequences. This sets a dangerous precedent for an arms race of power grabs and abuses.
END OF SUMMARY.
