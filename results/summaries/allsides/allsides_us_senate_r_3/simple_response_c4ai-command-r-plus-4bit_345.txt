SUMMARY: Schadenfreude is felt as Senate Democrats, who once supported the "nuclear option" to weaken the filibuster, now regret their decision as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to make his Cabinet and judge nominations. Their short-sighted power grab, which destroyed checks and balances, was justified as necessary to help President Barack Obama appoint left-wing populists to positions. However, the true motive was short-term political gains.

Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware now regrets the decision, realizing the value of the filibuster as a speed bump to slow down nominees. Unfortunately, the damage has been done, and these changes are unlikely to be reversed as majorities will continue to abuse the process for their gain. Progressives, in particular, hold contempt for the filibuster due to their disdain for federalism. This reckless behavior sets dangerous precedents and undermines the very checks and balances the Founding Fathers put in place to prevent absolute power. The nation must recognize the dangers of this arms race and work to restore process and stability over partisan gains.

END OF SUMMARY.
