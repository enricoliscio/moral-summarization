SUMMARY: Senate Democrats now regret their decision to 'blow up' the filibuster a few years ago, as it has given President-elect Donald Trump the ability to operate under the same rules they set. By weakening the filibuster, Democrats prioritized short-term political gains over process and stability, and now face the consequences of their recklessness. The filibuster was meant to prevent absolute power by any one branch of government, but Democrats, led by Sen. Harry Reid, chose to eliminate it for their own power grabs. This destruction of checks and balances sets a dangerous precedent, and it is unlikely that any majority will restore the filibuster or refrain from abusing the process for their own gain. Progressives, in particular, hold contempt for the filibuster and federalism, and continue to seek ways to manipulate Senate procedure for their ideological ends. The nation must recognize the dangers of this arms race and work to restore process and stability in government.
END OF SUMMARY.
