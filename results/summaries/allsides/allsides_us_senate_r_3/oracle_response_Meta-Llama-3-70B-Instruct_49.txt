SUMMARY:

The article expresses schadenfreude towards Senate Democrats who now regret their decision to "blow up" the filibuster, allowing President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons admit to regretting their vote, but only because it will enable Trump to operate with ease, not because they regret their own "recklessness" and "power grabs". The author argues that Democrats didn't change the rules for a grand ideological purpose, but for short-term political gains. They "weakened" the filibuster to help President Obama, but now lament its consequences. The article criticizes Democrats for their "majoritarianism" and "destroying" checks and balances, which will lead to further "abuses" of power. The author concludes that Democrats' actions have set a dangerous precedent, and it's unlikely that the filibuster will be restored.
