SUMMARY: In a recent CNN article, Senate Democrats expressed regret for their decision to weaken the filibuster a few years ago, as it now allows President-elect Donald Trump to easily appoint his Cabinet and judges. The filibuster, a parliamentary procedure, was once a powerful tool for the minority party to slow down or block legislation. However, in 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Democratic colleagues eliminated the use of the filibuster for most presidential appointments, a move now referred to as the "nuclear option." At the time, Democrats argued that it was necessary to help President Barack Obama appoint left-wing populists to key positions. Now, they are facing the consequences of their power grab, as Trump will be able to operate under the rules they set. Some Democrats, like Senator Chris Coons, have expressed regret for their short-sighted decision, while others continue to defend their actions. The article argues that the filibuster is an important check on power and that the arms race to pack the Supreme Court and other federal courts sets a dangerous precedent.
