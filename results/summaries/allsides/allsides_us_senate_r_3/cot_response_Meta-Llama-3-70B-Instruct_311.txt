SUMMARY:
Senate Democrats are experiencing schadenfreude as they regret their decision to weaken the filibuster, which has allowed President-elect Donald Trump to easily appoint his Cabinet and judges. They are now realizing that their "recklessness" in pursuing short-term political gains has led to a loss of checks and balances in the system. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons and Sen. Jeff Merkley, who were once proponents of the "nuclear option," now regret their decision, acknowledging that it was a "terrific speed bump" that could have slowed down Trump's nominees. The article argues that Democrats' contempt for the filibuster and federalism has led to a dangerous precedent, where each party will continue to undermine the system for their own gain. This "arms race" sets a dangerous precedent, and it would be nice if the nation realized the importance of preserving tradition, norms, and process. END OF SUMMARY.
