SUMMARY:

The article discusses how Senate Democrats, who previously voted to weaken the filibuster, now regret their decision as it allows President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees and judges. Democrats, such as Sen. Chris Coons, admit that they made a mistake and that the filibuster would have been a useful "speed bump" to slow down the confirmation process. The article argues that Democrats didn't change the rules for ideological purposes, but for short-term political gains. It also criticizes liberal pundits, such as Paul Krugman, who previously claimed that the filibuster would destroy America. The article concludes that the changes to the filibuster will likely never be reversed and that both parties will continue to abuse the system for partisan gains.
