SUMMARY: Schadenfreude is felt as Senate Democrats, who once held the majority and eliminated the filibuster to push through Obama's nominees, now regret their decision as Trump uses the same rules to appoint his own. The filibuster was a crucial speed bump in the confirmation process, and its elimination by Democrats for short-term political gains has led to a reckless power grab by Trump. Despite warnings from figures like Sen. Harry Reid, the damage has been done, and the consequences will likely be felt for years to come. The arms race to control the Supreme Court and load it with ideological judges sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the very checks and balances that protect our democracy. It is a cautionary tale of the dangers of partisan politics and the importance of preserving process and stability over short-sighted gains. 

END OF SUMMARY.
