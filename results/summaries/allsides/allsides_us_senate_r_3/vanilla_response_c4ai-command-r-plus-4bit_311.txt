SUMMARY: In the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet and judicial nominee selections, Senate Democrats who voted to weaken the filibuster a few years ago now express regret over their decision. The filibuster, a parliamentary procedure that allows for extended debate to delay or prevent a vote on a bill, was once a valuable tool for slowing down nominees and appointments. However, the nuclear option, a tactic used by Democrats to eliminate the filibuster for some Senate debates, has now backfired as Trump utilizes the same rules to push through his agenda. While Democrats initially justified their actions as necessary to help President Barack Obama appoint left-wing populists to key positions, the long-term consequences of their power grab are now apparent. This episode highlights the recklessness of Washington politics and the short-sightedness of prioritizing short-term political gains over tradition, norms, and process. Progressives' contempt for federalism and the filibuster continues, with some even attempting to use Senate procedure to appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. This arms race sets dangerous precedents, and it remains to be seen if the nation will recognize the importance of process and stability over partisan gains.
