Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article starts with the author feeling schadenfreude about Senate Democrats regretting the 'nuclear option' after Trump's election. They mention that Democrats changed the filibuster rules, which now allows Trump to appoint his nominees more easily. The author points out that Democrats didn't regret their decision for ideological reasons but because it's now benefiting Republicans. 

The author questions whether the short-term gains, like appointing certain officials, were worth it, especially since Democrats could have used the filibuster as a check. They also criticize the Democrats for not valuing tradition and process, which could prevent future issues. 

The article also mentions how Democrats, when in the minority, warned about the dangers of weakening the filibuster, but once in power, they abolished it. The author is critical of this hypocrisy and the long-term consequences of such actions. They argue that this sets a dangerous precedent and that the arms race in Senate procedures is harmful.

So, the moral framing here is that Democrats' shortsighted actions have led to a loss of checks and balances, which is now causing regret. The author is warning against the dangers of disregarding tradition and process for immediate political gains, highlighting the potential for future abuse.

I need to make sure the summary captures this critique, the regret of Democrats, the consequences of their actions, and the moral lesson about valuing process over partisanship. I'll structure the summary to first state the Democrats' regret, explain their previous actions, the consequences, and the author's warning about the long-term implications.
