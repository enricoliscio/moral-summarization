Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is discussing the Senate Democrats' regret over abolishing the filibuster, which they now see as a mistake because it allows Trump to easily appoint nominees. The author uses words like "recklessness," "destroying," and "abuses" to criticize the Democrats' decision. 

I should start by mentioning the Democrats' regret and the consequences of their action. Then, I'll include how they weakened the filibuster, leading to a majoritarian approach. The author mentions the nuclear option and the impact on checks and balances, so those terms are important. 

I also need to highlight the short-term gains versus long-term consequences, using words like "exaggerate" and "destroy." The author points out that Democrats didn't think about future implications, so I'll note that. 

Finally, I'll wrap it up by emphasizing the precedent set and the arms race in Senate procedures, using words like "precedent" and "process." I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including the key moral terms.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the regret of Senate Democrats over their decision to weaken the filibuster, a move they now see as reckless and destructive. By eliminating this "speed bump" in the Senate, they enabled President Trump to easily confirm his nominees, a consequence they now deeply regret. The author criticizes the Democrats for prioritizing short-term political gains over the long-term stability of the political process. The nuclear option, which allowed confirmations with a simple majority, was justified at the time as a way to prevent Republicans from "disabling" the executive branch, but the author argues this was an exaggeration. The Democrats' actions, driven by majoritarianism, have set a dangerous precedent, undermining the checks and balances that the Founding Fathers established to prevent absolute power. The author warns that this move will likely never be reversed, as future majorities will use the same process to roll back previous Senate "abuses." The article concludes by highlighting the dangers of this arms race in Senate procedure, emphasizing the importance of process, stability, and the preservation of democratic norms. END OF SUMMARY.
