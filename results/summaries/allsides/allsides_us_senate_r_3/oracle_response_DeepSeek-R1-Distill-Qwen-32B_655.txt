Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Senate Democrats regretting the "nuclear option" they used to weaken the filibuster, which now allows Trump to appoint his nominees without much opposition. The author uses words like "recklessness," "majoritarianism," and "checks and balances" to critique their decision.

I should start by stating that the article is a critique of Democrats regretting their past action. Then, mention the schadenfreude they feel now. Highlight that they weakened the filibuster for short-term gains, which backfired. Include terms like "recklessness," "checks and balances," and "majoritarianism."

Next, explain that the change was done for political gain, not a grand purpose. Use "exaggerate" when talking about the claims made by liberals. Also, note that the changes are unlikely to be reversed, emphasizing the loss of stability and process.

Finally, conclude by mentioning the dangerous precedent set and the arms race in Senate procedures, using words like "abuses," "process," and "stability."

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Senate Democrats for regretting their decision to weaken the filibuster, a move they now see as reckless and a power grab. By eliminating the filibuster, they removed a crucial "speed bump" in the confirmation process, enabling President Trump to appoint nominees more easily. The author argues that Democrats didn't destroy checks and balances for ideological reasons but for short-term political gains, such as advancing Obama's agenda. Liberals, including Paul Krugman, exaggerated the filibuster's dangers, claiming it would destroy America, while Obama successfully passed major legislation and appointed liberal justices. The author warns that the elimination of the filibuster sets a dangerous precedent, as future majorities may exploit the same process. The nuclear option has likely irreversibly altered Senate procedures, prioritizing partisanship over stability and process. This arms race in Senate rules risks further undermining constitutional balance, with both parties likely exploiting the system for their gain. END OF SUMMARY.
