SUMMARY:

The article critiques Senate Democrats for their past decision to weaken the filibuster, allowing President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees. Democrats, such as Sen. Chris Coons, now regret their vote, but not because they realize the importance of checks and balances, but because they fear Trump's power. The article argues that Democrats' short-term political gains have led to long-term consequences, undermining the system of government. It highlights the hypocrisy of Democrats, who previously claimed the filibuster was necessary to prevent absolute power, but abandoned this principle when they gained power. The article concludes that the erosion of the filibuster has set a dangerous precedent, allowing for unchecked power and undermining the system of government. It laments that Democrats' pursuit of power has led to the degradation of democratic institutions.
