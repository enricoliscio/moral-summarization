Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article is about the Democrats regretting the nuclear option they used to weaken the filibuster. It seems to criticize their decision, pointing out that they're now facing the consequences with Trump's nominations. The author uses terms like "schadenfreude," "recklessness," and "abuses" to convey the moral judgment against the Democrats' actions.

In STEP 1, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "schadenfreude," "recklessness," "regret," "speed bump," "emergency brake," "majoritarianism," "power grabs," "short-term political gains," "myth," "tragedy," "farce," "checks and balances," "absolute power," "abuses," "contempt," "arms race," "dangerous precedents," "courageous," "ideology," "partisanship," "unconstitutional," "opportunism," "hypocrisy," "abuses," "precedents," and "stability" stand out as morally charged.

For the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include these moral terms. The main points are the Democrats' regret, the consequences of their actions, the criticism of their short-term gains, and the broader implications for Senate rules and federalism. I'll structure the summary to highlight their initial decision, the regret, the critique of their motives, and the ongoing issues with Senate procedures.

I should ensure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it too verbose. I'll focus on the key points: the nuclear option's impact, the Democrats' regret, the critique of their motives, and the ongoing arms race in Senate procedures. I'll make sure to mention the author's view that this sets dangerous precedents and undermines stability.

Now, putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with the Democrats' regret, explaining the context of the nuclear option, their initial motives, the consequences, and the broader implications for Senate rules and federalism. I'll include the moral terms to preserve the author's framing.

**SUMMARY:**

The article discusses Senate Democrats' regret over their decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they now see as reckless. By invoking the nuclear option, they weakened the filibuster, which had served as a "speed bump" and "emergency brake" in the Senate. The author criticizes their decision, arguing it was motivated by short-term political gains rather than a grand ideological purpose. Democrats now face the consequences as President Trump uses the same rules to advance his nominees. The author highlights the hypocrisy of Democrats, who once warned against the dangers of weakening checks and balances but later embraced the nuclear option for their political advantage. The article also critiques progressives' enduring contempt for federalism and the ongoing arms race in Senate procedures, which sets dangerous precedents. The author laments the loss of stability and the precedent of using majoritarianism to bypass traditional processes, urging a return to reverence for the Founding Fathers' checks and balances. END OF SUMMARY.
