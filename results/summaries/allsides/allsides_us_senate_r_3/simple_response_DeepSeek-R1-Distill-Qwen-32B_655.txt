Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about Senate Democrats regretting the 'nuclear option' they used to eliminate the filibuster. The author feels some schadenfreude about this because now Trump can use the same process to appoint his nominees. The author criticizes the Democrats for their short-term political gain, which backfired when Republicans took over. They mention specific senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley who regretted the move, but the author points out that they didn't regret the power grab itself, just the consequences under Trump.

The article also references Paul Krugman's criticism of the filibuster, implying that the Democrats' actions were overblown. It notes that Obama had already made significant changes without needing the nuclear option, suggesting that the Democrats' move was unnecessary and reckless. The author warns about the dangers of this kind of political arms race, leading to instability in the government.

I need to capture these points in a concise summary, keeping the moral critique intact. The key elements are the Democrats' regret, the consequences of their action, the comparison to Obama's achievements, and the warning about future instability.

I should structure the summary to first mention the regret, then the context of the nuclear option, the author's criticism of the Democrats' short-term thinking, the example with Obama, and the caution about the long-term effects on the political system.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, highlighting the moral framing without getting too bogged down in details.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the regret expressed by Senate Democrats over their decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they now see as enabling President Trump to easily confirm his nominees. The author highlights the irony that Democrats, who once warned against weakening checks and balances, now face the consequences of their own power grab. The decision was driven by short-term political gains, not grand ideological principles, and has set a dangerous precedent. The author criticizes the Democrats for ignoring the value of tradition and process, which could have acted as a "speed bump" against recklessness. The piece also notes that President Obama had already achieved significant legislative successes without resorting to such measures, suggesting the move was unnecessary. The author warns that this kind of political arms race risks destabilizing the government, as neither party is likely to restore the filibuster once it has been dismantled. The moral framing underscores the dangers of prioritizing partisanship over institutional stability. END OF SUMMARY.
