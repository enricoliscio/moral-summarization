SUMMARY:

The article criticizes Senate Democrats for their past decision to weaken the filibuster, which has now come back to haunt them as President-elect Donald Trump names his Cabinet and judges. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons and Sen. Jeff Merkley, who voted to weaken the filibuster, now regret their decision, but not because they think it was wrong to undermine checks and balances, but because they fear Trump will use the same rules to his advantage. The article argues that Democrats didn't make this change for ideological reasons, but for short-term political gains, and that they are now reaping what they sowed. The author notes that the filibuster was a valuable "speed bump" that could have slowed down Trump's nominees, but instead, Democrats have enabled a "reckless" approach to governance. The article concludes that Democrats' actions have set a dangerous precedent and that they should have valued tradition, norms, and process over partisan gains.
