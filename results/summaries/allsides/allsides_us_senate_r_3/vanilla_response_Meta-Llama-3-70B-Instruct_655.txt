SUMMARY:

The article discusses how Senate Democrats, who previously voted to weaken the filibuster, now regret their decision as it allows President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his Cabinet and judicial nominees. Democrats, such as Sen. Chris Coons, are now realizing that the filibuster would have been a useful "speed bump" to slow down Trump's nominees. However, they don't regret their vote for majoritarianism or power grabs, but rather that Trump will now benefit from the rules they set for themselves. The article argues that Democrats didn't change the rules for ideological purposes, but for short-term political gains, and that their actions have set a dangerous precedent. It also criticizes liberal pundits, such as Paul Krugman, who previously argued that the filibuster would destroy America. The article concludes that the changes made to the filibuster will likely never be reversed, and that both parties will continue to use the process to their advantage.
