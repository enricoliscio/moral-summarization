Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Senate Democrats regretting the nuclear option they used to weaken the filibuster. They did this a few years ago, and now with Trump in power, they're seeing the consequences. The author points out that Democrats didn't change the rules for a grand ideological reason but for short-term political gains. They mention specific examples like Obama's appointments and how the Democrats didn't actually need the nuclear option because they already had the majority. The author criticizes the liberals for their contempt towards federalism and the potential arms race in Senate procedures, which could set dangerous precedents. The main idea is that the Democrats' decision backfired, and now they're facing the repercussions under Trump. I should make sure the summary captures their regret, the reasons behind the change, and the broader implications for the political process. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The article discusses Senate Democrats' regret over their decision to weaken the filibuster, a move they now see as enabling President Trump's Cabinet and judicial appointments. They initially changed the rules to allow confirmations with a simple majority, motivated by short-term political gains rather than ideological principles. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons now acknowledge that this action removed a "speed bump" that could have slowed problematic nominees. The author criticizes the decision, noting that Democrats had the power to confirm Obama's nominees without resorting to the nuclear option. The article also highlights the irony of liberals' contempt for federalism and the potential for an arms race in Senate procedures, which could set dangerous precedents. The changes are unlikely to be reversed, as no majority would restore the filibuster to its opponents. END OF SUMMARY.
