Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Senate Democrats regretting the nuclear option, which they used to weaken the filibuster. They're now facing the consequences with Trump's nominations.

First, I need to understand the main points. The author is critical of Democrats for their short-term political gain, leading to a loss of checks and balances. There's a sense of irony that they're regretting it now when it's benefiting Republicans.

I should highlight the regret expressed by senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley, and their initial justifications. Also, mention the comparison to liberals' current push against the Electoral College.

The moral framing here is about the dangers of ignoring tradition and process for political expediency. It's a cautionary tale about how actions meant to gain power can backfire and undermine democratic institutions.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the regret, the initial motivations, and the broader implications. Also, emphasize the author's point that this sets a dangerous precedent.

Okay, let me structure this: start with the Democrats' regret, explain the nuclear option, their initial reasons, the consequences, and the broader moral lesson about checks and balances.

SUMMARY: Senate Democrats are regretting their decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they made to advance President Obama's agenda. The author highlights the irony that Democrats, who once justified the nuclear option as a necessary step to prevent Republicans from "disabling" the executive branch, are now experiencing the consequences of their actions as President Trump uses the same rules to confirm his nominees. The article criticizes the short-sightedness of Democrats, who prioritized immediate political gains over the long-term stability of democratic processes. The author argues that the filibuster, though imperfect, served as a crucial check on power and a safeguard against recklessness. By eliminating it, Democrats set a dangerous precedent, undermining the traditions and norms that protect against absolute power. The piece also notes the hypocrisy of progressive voices, who now criticize the Electoral College with the same fervor they once directed at the filibuster. The author warns that such disregard for procedural safeguards weakens democratic institutions and risks creating a cycle of political escalation. END OF SUMMARY.
