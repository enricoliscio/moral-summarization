Okay, I need to tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the morally framed words first.

First, I'll read through the article to understand its main points. It's about Senate Democrats regretting the "nuclear option" after Trump's election, highlighting the consequences of their decision to weaken the filibuster. The author criticizes the Democrats for short-term political gains and the resulting instability in Senate procedures.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a judgment or ethical implication. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "schadenfreude," "recklessness," "regret," "speed bump," "emergency brake," "checks and balances," "ideological," "liberal," "myth," "tragedy," "farce," "absolute power," "checks and balances," "abuses," "courageous," "ideology," "contempt," "arms race," "precedents," "nice," "realize." I'll list each of these with a *.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral elements intact. I'll start by stating the Democrats' regret over the nuclear option. Then, mention the consequences of their action, the author's criticism of their shortsightedness, and the broader implications for political stability. I'll ensure to include words like "regret," "recklessness," "checks and balances," and "contempt" to maintain the moral framing.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally. It should reflect the author's disapproval of the Democrats' decision and its impact on the political process. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article and stick strictly to summarizing the given content while preserving the moral nuances.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures the essence of the article and that all key points are included without deviating from the moral perspective presented. I'll also check that the identified morally framed words are appropriately highlighted in the summary.

### SUMMARY:  
The article discusses Senate Democrats' regret over their decision to weaken the filibuster, a move they now see as a "speed bump" and "emergency brake" that could have slowed down nominees under a Republican administration. The author critiques the Democrats' shortsightedness, arguing they prioritized "short-term political gains" over "tradition, norms, and process." The decision, driven by "recklessness," allowed President Trump to appoint his Cabinet and judges without meaningful opposition. The author highlights the irony that Democrats, who once warned against the erosion of "checks and balances," now face the consequences of their own "power grab." The article also mocks progressive contempt for federalism and the ongoing "arms race" in Senate procedures, warning of dangerous precedents. The piece concludes by emphasizing the need for political stability over partisanship.  
END OF SUMMARY.
