SUMMARY:

The article discusses how Senate Democrats, who previously voted to weaken the filibuster, now regret their decision as it allows President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees and judges. Democrats, such as Sen. Chris Coons, admit that they made a mistake by eliminating the filibuster, which would have served as a "speed bump" to slow down Trump's nominees. The article argues that Democrats didn't make this change for ideological reasons, but for short-term political gains. It also criticizes liberal pundits, such as Paul Krugman, who claimed that the filibuster would destroy America. The article concludes that the changes made to the filibuster will likely never be reversed, and that the constant power struggles between parties will continue to undermine the system of checks and balances.
