SUMMARY:

The article expresses schadenfreude towards Senate Democrats who now regret their decision to weaken the filibuster, allowing President-elect Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons admit to regretting their vote, but only because it will now benefit Trump, not because they recognize the value of tradition and process. The author argues that Democrats didn't destroy the filibuster for ideological purposes, but for short-term political gains. They claimed it was necessary to prevent Republicans from "disabling" the executive branch, but in reality, it was a power grab. The author criticizes liberal pundits like Paul Krugman, who exaggerated the importance of the filibuster, and notes that Democrats' actions will set a dangerous precedent, leading to further recklessness and destruction of checks and balances. The article concludes that Democrats will never prioritize process and stability over partisanship, and that their actions will have long-term consequences.
