SUMMARY:
Senate Democrats are now regretting their decision to weaken the filibuster, a move they made to gain short-term political advantages. They are experiencing schadenfreude as President-elect Donald Trump names his Cabinet and judges, realizing that their recklessness has led to a loss of power. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons and Sen. Jeff Merkley, who voted to destroy checks and balances, are now lamenting their decision, acknowledging that it would have been a "terrific speed bump" to slow down nominees. However, they don't regret their vote for majoritarianism or power grabs, only that Trump will now operate under the rules they set for themselves. The article argues that Democrats' contempt for federalism and tradition has led to a dangerous precedent, and that their actions will likely never be reversed. END OF SUMMARY.
