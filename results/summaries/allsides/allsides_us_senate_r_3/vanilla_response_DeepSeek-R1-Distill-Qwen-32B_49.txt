Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the Senate Democrats regretting the "nuclear option" they used to weaken the filibuster. They did this a few years ago, and now with Trump, they're seeing the consequences. The author is pointing out the irony that Democrats are regretting their own decision because it's now helping Trump. 

The article mentions specific senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley who supported the change. They thought it was necessary to prevent Republicans from blocking Obama's nominations, but now it's being used against them. The author argues that the Democrats didn't have a long-term plan and only acted for short-term gains. 

There's also a part about how the filibuster was supposed to be a check on power, but by removing it, the Democrats made it easier for the other party to push through their own nominees. The author uses examples like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Supreme Court appointments to show that the Democrats didn't achieve much with the nuclear option. 

Additionally, the article criticizes the progressive contempt for federalism and checks and balances, suggesting that this kind of political maneuvering sets dangerous precedents. The author ends by saying that the changes are unlikely to be reversed and that this arms race in Senate procedures is harmful.

So, the main points are: Democrats regretted their own decision to eliminate the filibuster, which now allows Trump to appoint more nominees without opposition. The move was short-sighted and has led to a cycle of recklessness in Washington. The author emphasizes the irony and the long-term consequences of their actions.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the regret expressed by Senate Democrats over their decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they now see as enabling President Donald Trump to easily confirm his nominees. Senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley, who supported the change, now acknowledge that the filibuster could have acted as a check on Trump's appointments. The author criticizes the Democrats for prioritizing short-term political gains over the long-term stability of Senate procedures. The nuclear option, which allowed confirmation votes with a simple majority, was initially justified as necessary to prevent Republican obstruction during President Obama's tenure. However, the article argues that this decision has set a dangerous precedent, making it unlikely to be reversed and contributing to a cycle of political recklessness. END OF SUMMARY.
