SUMMARY:

The article criticizes Senate Democrats who, in 2013, voted to weaken the filibuster, allowing federal judicial nominees and executive-office appointments to be confirmed with a simple majority. Now, they regret their decision as President-elect Donald Trump will benefit from the new rules. The author argues that Democrats didn't make this change for ideological purposes, but for short-term political gains. They wanted to help President Obama appoint liberal nominees, but in doing so, they undermined the system's checks and balances. The article quotes Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons and Sen. Jeff Merkley, who now regret their decision, but only because it will benefit Trump, not because they value tradition and process. The author concludes that this kind of recklessness and partisanship will only lead to more instability and dangerous precedents.
