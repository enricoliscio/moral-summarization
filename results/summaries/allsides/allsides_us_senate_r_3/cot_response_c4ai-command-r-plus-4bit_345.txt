SUMMARY:
The article discusses the consequences of Senate Democrats' decision to eliminate the filibuster, also known as the "nuclear option," which has now backfired as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to make his Cabinet and judicial nominations. The decision, made for short-term political gains, has set a dangerous precedent and undermined the very checks and balances that the Founding Fathers put in place to prevent absolute power. Democrats like Senator Chris Coons now regret their vote, realizing that it has given Trump the same power they once sought for themselves. The filibuster, a traditional speed bump in the confirmation process, was eliminated by Senator Harry Reid and others who valued majoritarianism and power grabs over process and stability. This recklessness has led to an arms race where both parties will load the courts with their own nominees, setting dangerous precedents and further eroding the foundations of American democracy. The article concludes with a warning that the consequences of such actions will likely never be reversed and that the nation must recognize the dangers of this escalating partisanship.
