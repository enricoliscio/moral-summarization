SUMMARY:
Senate Democrats are experiencing regret and schadenfreude as they realize the consequences of their decision to weaken the filibuster three years ago. They had used the "nuclear option" to push through President Obama's nominees, but now they are powerless to stop President-elect Trump's appointees. Sen. Chris Coons admits to regretting his vote, acknowledging that the filibuster would have been a "terrific speed bump" to slow down nominees. The article argues that Democrats' short-term political gains have led to a dangerous precedent, where recklessness begets recklessness in Washington, D.C. The author criticizes the liberal punditry, including Paul Krugman, for their role in dismantling the filibuster, which has led to an unacceptable and farcical situation. The article concludes that the nation should realize the importance of tradition, norms, and process to prevent absolute power and maintain checks and balances.
