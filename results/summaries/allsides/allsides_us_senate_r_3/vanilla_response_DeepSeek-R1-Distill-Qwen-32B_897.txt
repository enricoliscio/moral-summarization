Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the "nuclear option" in the Senate, which Democrats used to eliminate the filibuster for certain nominations. The author is reflecting on how this decision is now causing regret among Democrats as Trump uses the same rules to appoint his own nominees.

The article starts with the author expressing schadenfreude, which is a bit of a harsh tone but sets the stage. It mentions specific senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley who regret their votes to weaken the filibuster. The author argues that Democrats didn't destroy the filibuster for some grand ideological reason but for short-term political gains, which now backfired.

There's a critique of the Democrats' actions, pointing out that they were able to pass significant legislation under Obama without needing to eliminate the filibuster. The author also references Paul Krugman's past arguments against the filibuster, highlighting the irony of progressives now regretting the change.

The main argument is that both parties have shown contempt for the filibuster when it suits their political needs, leading to a dangerous cycle of power grabs. The author warns against this kind of political arms race, emphasizing the importance of checks and balances and the long-term consequences of such decisions.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, focusing on the regret of Democrats, the reasons behind their decision, the critique of their actions, and the broader implications for political stability. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the regret expressed by Senate Democrats over their decision to eliminate the filibuster for federal judicial and executive appointments, a move known as the "nuclear option." Senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley, who supported the change, now rue the decision as President Trump uses the same rules to appoint his nominees. The author critiques the Democrats' short-sighted motivation, driven by political gain rather than principle, and highlights the irony that progressives, who once attacked the filibuster, now regret its removal. The article warns that both parties have shown contempt for the filibuster when in power, leading to a dangerous cycle of political recklessness. The elimination of this check on power undermines the system of checks and balances, with long-term consequences for political stability. END OF SUMMARY.
