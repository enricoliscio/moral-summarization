SUMMARY: In a recent CNN piece, Senate Democrats expressed regret over their decision to weaken the filibuster a few years ago, as it now allows President-elect Donald Trump to make nominations with ease. The filibuster, a parliamentary procedure, was traditionally used to prevent absolute power by any one branch of government. However, Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid, chose to weaken it for short-term political gains. Now, Democrats like Senator Chris Coons of Delaware regret their decision as it has given Trump unchecked power. The article argues that this is a result of recklessness begetting recklessness in Washington, D.C., and that the filibuster was always an important speed bump in the nomination process. Furthermore, it criticizes the liberal punditry for their previous attacks on the filibuster and the Electoral College, arguing that progressives hold an enduring contempt for federalism. The author warns that this kind of arms race sets dangerous precedents and hopes that the nation will recognize the importance of process and stability over partisan gains.
