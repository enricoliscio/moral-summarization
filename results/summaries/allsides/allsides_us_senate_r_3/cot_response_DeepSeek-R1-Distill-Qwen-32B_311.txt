Alright, I need to tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. 

First, I should read the article carefully. It's about the Democratic regret over changing the filibuster rule, leading to the Republican administration's ease in appointing nominees. The author uses strong moral terms like "recklessness," "abuses," and "contempt." 

The user has two main tasks: identify morally framed words and summarize the article while preserving those terms. 

For the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral judgment. Words like "schadenfreude," "recklessness," "regret," "corrupt," "abuses," "contempt," and "arms race" stand out. These words convey the author's disapproval of the Democrats' actions.

Next, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll focus on the key points: the Democrats regretting their decision, the consequences of weakening the filibuster, the author's criticism of their short-term gain, and the long-term damage to checks and balances.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the moral implications without adding personal opinions. It's important to maintain the original framing, showing that the author sees the Democrats' actions as reckless and self-serving, leading to a dangerous precedent.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the regret, then the consequences, followed by the author's critique of their motives and the broader implications for governance. This approach should cover all necessary points while adhering to the word limit and preserving the moral language.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's clear, concise, and includes all the identified moral terms. Making sure it's within 200 words and flows naturally is crucial for the user's requirements.

### SUMMARY:  
The article discusses the regret of Senate Democrats over their decision to weaken the filibuster, a move they now see as enabling President Trump to easily confirm nominees. The author criticizes Democrats for prioritizing short-term political gains over preserving checks and balances, arguing that their actions set a dangerous precedent. The filibuster, once seen as a "speed bump" against recklessness, is now gone, allowing majoritarian rule. The author highlights the hypocrisy of Democrats, who once warned against the erosion of democratic norms but later embraced the nuclear option for political advantage. Progressives, the author claims, hold contempt for federalism and tradition, leading to an arms race in Senate procedures that threatens stability. The consequences of this recklessness—unchecked power and a breakdown of norms—are unlikely to be reversed, leaving the nation vulnerable to further abuses. END OF SUMMARY.
