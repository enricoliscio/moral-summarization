Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The author is critical of Democrats for eliminating the filibuster, arguing it's led to regret now that Republicans are using the same rules. I should highlight the main points: the Democrats' regret, the short-term political gains they sought, the consequences of their actions, and the moral lesson about the importance of checks and balances. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key arguments and the author's perspective on the issue.

SUMMARY: The article critiques Democrats' decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they now regret as Republicans use the same rules to confirm Trump's nominees. The author argues that Democrats, driven by short-term political gains, destroyed a key check on executive and judicial appointments, setting a dangerous precedent. The piece highlights the hypocrisy of Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons, who now lament the loss of the filibuster while previously advocating for its abolition. The author warns that such recklessness in Washington weakens democratic norms and traditions, making it harder to resist future power grabs. The article concludes that the nuclear option, once used, is unlikely to be reversed, and the arms race in Senate procedures risks destabilizing the balance of power. END OF SUMMARY.
