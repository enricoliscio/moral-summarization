Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has already done the first step, identifying the morally framed words. Now, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Senate Democrats regretting the "nuclear option" they used to weaken the filibuster, which now allows Trump to appoint his nominees more easily. The author criticizes their decision, arguing it was for short-term gains and destroyed checks and balances. They mention specific senators like Chris Coons and Jeff Merkley, and reference liberals like Paul Krugman who were against the filibuster. The article also notes that Democrats didn't use the nuclear option for grand ideological reasons but for political gains, and that this change is unlikely to be reversed.

Now, I need to incorporate the morally framed words: schadenfreude, recklessness, regret, nuclear option, power grab, short-term, political gains, checks and balances, liberals, progressives, contempt, arms race, dangerous precedents.

I'll start by mentioning the regret of Democrats over the nuclear option, their power grab, and the recklessness leading to the current situation. Then, I'll note that they didn't have a grand ideological reason but acted for short-term political gains. The author criticizes liberals and progressives for their contempt for federalism and checks and balances, leading to an arms race in Senate procedures, which sets dangerous precedents. Finally, the article warns that this change is unlikely to be reversed, affecting the balance of power.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**

The article discusses the regret expressed by Senate Democrats over their decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they now view as a "power grab" and "recklessness." They implemented the "nuclear option," which allowed for confirmations with a simple majority, a decision they now rue as it enables President Trump to appoint his nominees more easily. The author criticizes this action, arguing it was driven by "short-term political gains" rather than a grand ideological purpose. Liberals and progressives are criticized for their "contempt" for federalism and checks and balances, leading to an "arms race" in Senate procedures that sets "dangerous precedents." The article warns that this change is unlikely to be reversed, as neither party is likely to restore the filibuster, leaving the nation vulnerable to further political instability. **END OF SUMMARY.**
