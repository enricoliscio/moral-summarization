SUMMARY:
Senate Democrats are now regretting their decision to weaken the filibuster, which allowed them to push through President Obama's nominees with a simple majority. They are experiencing schadenfreude as they realize that this "recklessness" has come back to haunt them, enabling President-elect Trump to name his Cabinet and judges with ease. Democrats like Sen. Chris Coons are regretful, but not because they believe they were wrong to pursue majoritarianism, but because they didn't consider the long-term consequences of their actions. The article argues that Democrats prioritized short-term political gains over process and stability, and that their actions have led to a dangerous precedent. The author suggests that this kind of "arms race" will continue, with each party seeking to gain power at the expense of the other, ultimately leading to a loss of checks and balances in government. END OF SUMMARY.
