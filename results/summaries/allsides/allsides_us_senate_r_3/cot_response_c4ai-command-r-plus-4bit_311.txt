SUMMARY:
In a piece for CNN, Senate Democrats express regret over their decision to weaken the filibuster, now that President-elect Donald Trump will be able to utilize the same rules they set for themselves. The author of this article argues that Democrats' actions were reckless and motivated by short-term political gains rather than any grand ideological purpose. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who voted to weaken the filibuster, now regrets the decision as it has removed a speed bump or emergency brake on the path to confirmation. The author suggests that Democrats' actions were driven by a contempt for federalism and a desire for power, and that similar actions in the future will only lead to an arms race of dangerous precedents. The piece also criticizes liberal pundits like Paul Krugman, who claimed that the filibuster would destroy America, and highlights the hypocrisy of Democrats who once warned that weakening the filibuster would destroy the checks and balances put in place by the Founding Fathers. The author concludes by expressing doubt that the filibuster will ever be restored and worries that the current political environment, where winning is the ideology, makes such a restoration even less likely.
