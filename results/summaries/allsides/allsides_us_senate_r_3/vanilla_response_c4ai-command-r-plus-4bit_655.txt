SUMMARY: In a recent CNN article, Senate Democrats expressed regret for their decision to weaken the filibuster a few years ago, as it now allows President-elect Donald Trump to easily appoint his Cabinet and judges. The filibuster, a parliamentary procedure, was previously used to prevent the Senate from moving forward with a vote on a bill or nomination. Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid, had voted to weaken the filibuster to help President Barack Obama appoint left-wing populists to various positions. However, this decision has now backfired as it gives Trump the same ability to appoint conservative nominees with little opposition. Some Democrats, like Senator Chris Coons, now regret their decision, realizing that the filibuster was an important "speed bump" in the confirmation process. The article also criticizes the liberal punditry for their previous support of eliminating the filibuster and their current attempts to work around Senate procedure to appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. It argues that such actions set dangerous precedents and undermine the stability and process of the Senate.
