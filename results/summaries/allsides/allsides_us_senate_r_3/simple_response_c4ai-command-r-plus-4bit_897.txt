SUMMARY: Schadenfreude is experienced as Democrats who voted to weaken the filibuster now regret their decision as President-elect Donald Trump names his Cabinet and judges. The filibuster was a valuable tradition that provided stability and prevented one branch of government from having absolute power. Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid, voted to weaken it for short-term political gains, and now face the consequences as Trump operates under the rules they set. This recklessness begets more recklessness, as we see with some liberals trying to put Judge Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court, which would only lead to Republicans loading the court themselves. The filibuster was meant to protect federalism and prevent majoritarianism, and its weakening sets a dangerous precedent. It is unlikely that any majority will restore the filibuster or stand for process and stability over partisanship. This reflects a larger issue of winning being valued over ideology in today's political environment.

END OF SUMMARY.
