Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is criticizing Senate Democrats for eliminating the filibuster, leading to regret as Trump uses the same rules. They mention schadenfreude, which is a moral judgment. The article uses terms like'recklessness,' 'weaken,''majoritarianism,' and 'checks and balances.' 

I should start by identifying the key events: Democrats regretting the nuclear option, the consequences for Trump's nominations, the shortsightedness of their decision, and the potential for future instability. I need to include terms like 'blow,''recklessness,' 'weaken,' 'checks and balances,' 'function,' 'exaggerate,' 'destroy,' 'prevent,' 'absolute,' 'eliminate,' 'abuses,' 'process,''stability,' and 'race.'

I'll structure the summary to show the Democrats' initial action, their current regret, the impact on Trump, and the broader implications for the political process. I'll make sure to use the moral words to highlight the author's stance on the issue.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the key moral terms. I'll check each sentence to see if it captures the necessary points and uses the appropriate vocabulary.

SUMMARY: The author criticizes Senate Democrats for regretting their decision to eliminate the filibuster, a move they now see as reckless and shortsighted. By "blowing up" the filibuster, they enabled a "majoritarianism" that has allowed President Trump to appoint judges and Cabinet members without meaningful opposition. The author highlights the irony that Democrats, who once warned against "destroying checks and balances," now lament the consequences of their own "power grab." The decision was driven by short-term political gains, not a grand ideological purpose, and has set a dangerous precedent. The author argues that the filibuster was a crucial "speed bump" to prevent "absolute power" and ensure the government could "function" and "respond" to challenges. Progressives, the author notes, have long held a "contempt" for federalism and the filibuster, and their actions have led to a "race" of political "abuses." The elimination of the filibuster, the author warns, undermines "stability" and "process," leaving the Senate vulnerable to future "recklessness." END OF SUMMARY.
