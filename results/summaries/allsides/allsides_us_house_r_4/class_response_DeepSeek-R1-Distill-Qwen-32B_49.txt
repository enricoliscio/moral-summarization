Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, two congressmen from different parties introduced a resolution against blasphemy laws. They're targeting over 70 governments to repeal these laws. The resolution mentions that these laws let governments decide religious truth, which is problematic. They cite examples like Russia banning Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighurs, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws leading to death sentences.

The article also mentions support from USCIRF, a bipartisan group, which is happy about the resolution. They point out that these laws are used to target marginalized groups. The UN's stance is included, supporting religious rights, and the resolution aligns with that. The bill would add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons to label countries as concerning for religious freedom. Currently, only 10 countries are on that list, but the resolution wants more.

Some countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada have already repealed their blasphemy laws, which is a positive note.

Now, the user wants a summary that keeps the moral framing words. The author used words like blasphemy, heresy, apostasy, empower, impose, violence, restrictions, etc. I need to make sure these words are included.

I should structure the summary to highlight the bipartisan effort, the problematic nature of the laws, the examples given, the support from USCIRF, the UN's role, and the impact on religious freedom. Also, mention the countries that have repealed their laws.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included without making it too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning "blasphemy," "heresy," and "apostasy" laws, urging over 70 governments to repeal such restrictions. The resolution highlights how these laws enable governments to "impose" religious dogma and "empower" officials to use "violence" against minorities. It cites examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to death sentences. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating such laws are often "weaponized" to "target" marginalized communities. The resolution aligns with the UN's protection of religious rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and calls for prisoners held on blasphemy charges to be "released." It also proposes adding blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as grounds for designating countries as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom. The resolution notes positive steps by Ireland, Greece, and Canada to "repeal" blasphemy laws, with Ireland recently criminalizing blasphemy and Canada ending its "blasphemous libel" law in 2018. END OF SUMMARY.
