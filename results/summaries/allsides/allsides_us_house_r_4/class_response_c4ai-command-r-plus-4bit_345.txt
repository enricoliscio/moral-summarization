SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence and sanctions. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan implementing alarming bans and detentions. The resolution is cheered by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which states that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities and legitimize persecution. The resolution upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, endorsed by international covenants, and adds blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." It also highlights nations that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. This resolution is a significant step towards protecting religious freedom and ensuring governments do not impose or sanction violence in the name of religious dogma.
END OF SUMMARY.
