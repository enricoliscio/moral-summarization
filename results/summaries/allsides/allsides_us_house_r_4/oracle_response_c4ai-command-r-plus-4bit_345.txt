SUMMARY: Two US congressman have introduced a bipartisan resolution, HR 512, condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately empower governments to impose religious dogma and sanction violence against individuals or minorities. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan employing blasphemy laws to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy charges and is supported by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which works to raise awareness of the persecution and violence legitimized by these laws. HR 512 upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, endorsed by international covenants, and seeks to add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." The resolution also highlights nations that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. This move sends a strong message against the imposition of religious dogma and the punishment of dissent, and instead promotes religious freedom and tolerance as fundamental human rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
