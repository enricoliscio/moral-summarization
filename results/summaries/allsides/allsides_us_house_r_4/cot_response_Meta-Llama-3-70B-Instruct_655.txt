SUMMARY:
A bipartisan resolution, introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, condemns "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent, including heresy and apostasy. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal such laws, which "inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth" and "empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through the power of the government or through violence sanctioned by the government." The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that such laws are often used to target marginalized religious communities and legitimize egregious acts of persecution and violence. The resolution cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. END OF SUMMARY.
