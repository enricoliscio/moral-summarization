SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning the use of "blasphemy" laws to punish religious dissent. The resolution, House Resolution 512, calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws that restrict religious freedom, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws. Religious liberty advocates, including the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), have cheered the resolution, arguing that such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities and legitimize persecution and violence. The resolution cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions in countries such as Russia, China, and Pakistan, where individuals have been detained, imprisoned, or sentenced to death for blasphemy or religious dissent. It also recognizes the civil rights upheld by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protect religious practice and expression, and endorsed by HR 512. Additionally, the resolution notes the progress made by nations like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, who have recently repealed blasphemy laws. By recognizing the moral implications of blasphemy laws and their potential for abuse, this resolution takes a stand for religious freedom and against the imposition of religious dogma by governments.
