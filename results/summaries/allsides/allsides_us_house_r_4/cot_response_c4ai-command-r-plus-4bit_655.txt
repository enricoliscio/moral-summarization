SUMMARY: 
Congressmen Jamie Raskin and Mark Meadows have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning the use of "blasphemy" laws, which punish religious dissent. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal such laws, arguing that they inappropriately empower officials to impose religious dogma and sanction violence. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with alarming new reports citing Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws as examples. The resolution is cheered by religious liberty advocates and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), who recognize the weaponization of these laws to target marginalized communities. It also upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, endorsed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The resolution further notes nations that have taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws and requests that 16 nations, including Russia, Pakistan, and China, be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." The resolution aims to raise awareness of the egregious persecution and violence legitimized by blasphemy laws and calls for the release of all prisoners held on such charges.
