SUMMARY:

A bipartisan resolution introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows condemns "blasphemy" laws, which punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal these laws, which inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence sanctioned by the government. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, the detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims in northwest China, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws, which have led to the imprisonment of individuals on death row or serving life sentences. The resolution has received widespread bipartisan support, with the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom echoing the call to release prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. The resolution aims to raise awareness of the egregious acts of persecution and violence legitimized by these laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
