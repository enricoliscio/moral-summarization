SUMMARY: Two US congressmen have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on governments worldwide to repeal such legislation, which punishes religious dissent and empowers officials to impose religious dogma through state-sanctioned violence. The resolution, introduced by Reps. Raskin and Meadows, recognizes the inappropriate role of governments as arbiters of religious truth and highlights alarming trends of religious freedom restrictions globally, including in Russia, China, and Pakistan. The resolution is supported by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, which notes that these laws are often used to target marginalized religious communities. It also commends nations that have repealed blasphemy laws and urges the President and Secretary of State to designate countries with blasphemy laws as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." This resolution is a moral stand against religious persecution and a call for the protection of civil rights for religious practice and expression worldwide. END OF SUMMARY.
