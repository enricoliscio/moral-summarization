SUMMARY:

In a bipartisan effort, two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws, which restrict religious freedom and empower governments to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom endorses the resolution, urging the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. The resolution also recognizes nations that have taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada.
