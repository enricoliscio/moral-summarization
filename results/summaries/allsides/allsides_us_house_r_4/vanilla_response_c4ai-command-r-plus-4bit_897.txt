SUMMARY: Two US congressmen, Democrat Jamie Raskin and Republican Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent. The resolution, House Resolution 512, recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma. It cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions, including in Russia, China, and Pakistan. The resolution is supported by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which stated that blasphemy laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution also notes nations that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. It calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and adds blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom."
