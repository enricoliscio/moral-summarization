SUMMARY:

In a rare display of bipartisan unity, two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution, backed by religious liberty advocates, calls on over 70 governments to repeal such laws, recognizing that they inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities. The move is a significant step towards promoting religious freedom, as such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has cheered the resolution, urging the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges.

END OF SUMMARY.
