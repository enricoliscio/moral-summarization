SUMMARY: Two US Congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), introduced House Resolution 512, which condemns "blasphemy" laws and calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent. The resolution recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws inappropriately empower governments to impose religious dogma and sanction violence. It cites alarming trends of religious freedom restrictions worldwide, including in Russia, China, and Pakistan. The resolution is supported by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which stated that such laws often target marginalized religious communities. The resolution also endorses civil rights for religious practice and expression upheld by the United Nations. It proposes adding blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." The resolution applauds nations that have repealed blasphemy laws, including Ireland, Greece, and Canada.
