SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning “blasphemy” laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that these laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma, often through violence or government-sanctioned force. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan implementing alarming bans, detentions, and restrictions on religious minorities. The resolution is supported by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws are often weaponized to target and persecute marginalized religious communities. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on such charges and encourages nations to repeal these laws, upholding international covenants on civil rights for religious practice and expression. This resolution strengthens efforts to hold nations accountable for religious freedom violations by adding blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as criteria for designating "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." The actions of Ireland, Greece, and Canada in repealing or not enforcing blasphemy laws are also commended. This bipartisan effort underscores the importance of protecting religious freedom and preventing the imposition of religious dogma through state-sanctioned violence or coercion.
