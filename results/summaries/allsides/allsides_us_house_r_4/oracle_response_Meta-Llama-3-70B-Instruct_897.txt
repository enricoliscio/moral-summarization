SUMMARY:

Two US congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws that criminalize blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy, which often target marginalized religious communities. These laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth, empowering officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence sanctioned by the government. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, the detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims in China, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws that have led to the imprisonment of individuals on death row or serving life sentences. The resolution has received widespread bipartisan support, aiming to raise awareness of the egregious acts of persecution and violence that these laws legitimize. It also echoes the call for all prisoners held on blasphemy charges to be released. END OF SUMMARY.
