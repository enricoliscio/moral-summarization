SUMMARY: Two US congressmen have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on more than 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence sanctioned by the state. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan cited as examples in the resolution. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has welcomed the resolution, stating that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution also notes progress in some nations, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada, which have recently repealed or criminalized blasphemy laws. The legislation is endorsed by international covenants upholding civil rights for religious practice and expression. By passing this resolution, Congress can send a strong message against the use of blasphemy laws to target and persecute religious minorities, and support efforts to repeal such laws worldwide.
END OF SUMMARY.
