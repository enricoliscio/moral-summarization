Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They're from different parties, which shows unity. The resolution condemns laws that punish religious dissent, like blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. It mentions several countries with problematic laws, such as Russia, China, and Pakistan. 

I should highlight the moral stance against government interference in religion. The resolution argues that these laws let governments impose religious dogma, which is a violation of freedom. It's important to note the impact on marginalized communities, as the USCIRF points out. 

Also, the article mentions international support, like the UN's stance and the resolution's alignment with existing laws. The fact that some countries have repealed such laws, like Ireland and Canada, shows progress and should be included.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the bipartisan effort, the condemned laws, examples of countries, the moral argument, international support, and the progress made. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the resolution, its purpose, examples, moral argument, and then the international context and progress.

Let me make sure to include the moral framing by emphasizing how these laws infringe on religious freedom and target minorities. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws, which they argue enable governments to impose religious dogma and perpetuate persecution. The resolution highlights how such laws disproportionately target marginalized religious communities, citing examples like Russia’s ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses, China’s detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. It also notes that over 40 individuals in Pakistan face death or life sentences for blasphemy. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, urging the release of prisoners held under these laws. The resolution aligns with the UN’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protects religious freedom, and calls for countries violating these principles to be designated as “countries of particular concern.” While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have repealed blasphemy laws, many others, including Russia, Pakistan, and China, continue to enforce them. The resolution aims to raise awareness of the human rights abuses these laws enable. END OF SUMMARY.
