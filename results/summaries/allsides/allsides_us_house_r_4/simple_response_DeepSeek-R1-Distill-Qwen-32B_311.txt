Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical aspects highlighted in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about two congressmen introducing a resolution against blasphemy laws. The resolution condemns these laws as tools for oppression and calls for their repeal. They mention several countries where these laws are used, like Pakistan, China, and Russia, and cite examples of persecution.

I need to highlight the moral issues here. The resolution argues that blasphemy laws let governments enforce religious beliefs, which is a violation of religious freedom. It's important to note the bipartisan support and the support from organizations like USCIRF, emphasizing that these laws target marginalized communities.

Also, the article mentions the UN's stance and the designation of countries of concern. I should include that to show the international context and the resolution's aim to expand this designation.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral arguments against these laws, the countries affected, and the supportive actions from the US government and international bodies.

Let me structure this: start with the resolution introduction, mention the lawmakers, the moral stance against government as religious arbiters, examples of persecution, international support, and the resolution's impact on designating countries. End with the call for awareness and justice.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. Also, preserve the moral framing by emphasizing the oppression and the need for repeal.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning blasphemy laws, which they argue empower governments to enforce religious dogma and oppress dissent. The resolution calls on over 70 countries to repeal laws punishing blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating such laws often target marginalized communities. The resolution aligns with the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protects religious freedom. It also proposes adding blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as criteria for designating countries as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom violations. Currently, 10 nations, including Pakistan and China, are designated under this category. The resolution highlights positive steps, such as Ireland and Canada repealing blasphemy laws, and urges global awareness of the persecution these laws enable. END OF SUMMARY.
