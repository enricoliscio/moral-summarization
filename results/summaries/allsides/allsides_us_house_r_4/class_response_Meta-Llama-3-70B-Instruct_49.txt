SUMMARY:

A bipartisan resolution has been introduced in the US House of Representatives, condemning "blasphemy" laws that restrict religious freedom and empower governments to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, the detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims in China, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom endorses the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. The resolution upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, and urges nations to repeal blasphemy laws, which legitimize persecution and violence.
