Alright, I need to summarize this news article about a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article mentions two congressmen, one Democrat and one Republican, introducing House Resolution 512. They're targeting over 70 countries with laws punishing religious dissent. The resolution condemns blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws, arguing that governments shouldn't dictate religious truth.

They cite examples like Russia banning Jehovah's Witnesses, China detaining Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws. The resolution is supported by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which is a bipartisan group. They're happy because these laws often target marginalized groups.

The resolution also aligns with UN human rights standards, specifically Articles 18 and 19. It suggests adding blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as reasons for designating countries as 'countries of particular concern.' Currently, only 10 out of 16 recommended countries are on that list.

Positive steps are noted in countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, which have repealed or abolished blasphemy laws.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I should highlight the bipartisan effort, the main points of the resolution, the examples given, the support from USCIRF, alignment with UN standards, and the progress in some countries repealing the laws.

Let me structure this step by step to ensure all key points are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced bipartisan House Resolution 512, condemning blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws. The resolution calls on over 70 countries to repeal such laws, arguing they enable governments to impose religious dogma or violence. It highlights examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to imprisonment or death sentences. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating such laws often target marginalized religious communities. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and proposes adding blasphemy-related offenses as criteria for designating countries as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom. While 10 nations are currently designated, the resolution urges action against others, including Russia, Pakistan, and China. It also notes positive steps by Ireland, Greece, and Canada in repealing blasphemy laws. END OF SUMMARY.
