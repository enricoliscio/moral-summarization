Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me go through the article and identify the key points.

First, two congressmen introduced a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. The resolution condemns laws that punish religious dissent. It mentions countries like Pakistan, China, and Russia, highlighting their use of such laws to target minorities. The resolution is supported by religious freedom advocates, including the USCIRF.

I should include words like "punishing," "empower," "impose," "violence," "sanctioned," "ban," "detention," "weaponized," "target," "persecution," "legitimize," "held," "repeal," "repealing," and "criminalized." I need to make sure these words are naturally integrated into the summary without making it sound forced.

The summary should mention the bipartisan nature, the countries involved, the impact on minorities, the support from USCIRF, and the call for repealing these laws. I'll structure it to flow from the introduction of the resolution to its implications and support.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary moral terms. Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and preserves the author's moral stance.

SUMMARY: Two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning "blasphemy" laws, which punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how such laws empower governments to impose religious dogma and violence, often targeting marginalized communities. It cites examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to imprisonment or death for individuals. Religious freedom advocates, including the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), support the resolution, calling for the repeal of these laws and the release of those held under them. The resolution aligns with international human rights standards, such as the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and could add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as criteria for designating countries as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom. Some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have already repealed blasphemy laws, while others, including Pakistan and China, remain under scrutiny. END OF SUMMARY.
