Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They're from different parties, so that's a positive sign of cooperation. The resolution aims to get over 70 countries to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, like blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy.

The moral angle here is about religious freedom and how these laws can oppress minorities. The resolution mentions specific examples like Russia banning Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws. It also cites the UN's support for civil rights related to religious expression.

The summary needs to highlight the bipartisan effort, the problematic laws, the examples given, and the support from organizations like USCIRF. Also, it's important to mention the resolution's aim to add blasphemy-related issues as grounds for designating countries as concerning for religious freedom.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral stance against using blasphemy laws to oppress. I'll structure it by first introducing the resolution, then the reasons behind it, the examples, and the support it's received. Finally, I'll note the resolution's goals regarding country designations and the positive steps taken by some nations.

Let me make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. The summary should flow logically, starting with the resolution, its purpose, the issues it addresses, and the implications. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning "blasphemy" laws and urging over 70 countries to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, such as blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how such laws enable governments to enforce religious dogma, often targeting marginalized communities. It cites examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to imprisonment or death sentences for individuals. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held under such laws. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and seeks to add blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as criteria for designating countries as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom. While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have repealed blasphemy laws, others, such as Pakistan and China, remain on the list of concern. The resolution underscores the moral imperative to protect religious freedom and oppose laws that legitimize persecution. END OF SUMMARY.
