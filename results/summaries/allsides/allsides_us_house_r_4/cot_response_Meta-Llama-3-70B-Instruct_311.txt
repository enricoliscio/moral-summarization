SUMMARY:
A bipartisan resolution introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows condemns "blasphemy" laws, urging over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws "inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth" and "empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through the power of the government or through violence sanctioned by the government." The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that these laws are often "weaponized to target marginalized religious communities" and lead to "egregious acts of persecution and violence." The resolution cites alarming reports from international organizations, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom endorses the resolution, calling for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. END OF SUMMARY.
