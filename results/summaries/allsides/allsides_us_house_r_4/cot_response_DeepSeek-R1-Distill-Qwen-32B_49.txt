Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but first, I have to identify all the morally framed words. The user provided an example with STEP 1 and a list of words. Let me go through the article again to spot those words.

The article talks about two congressmen introducing a resolution against blasphemy laws. Words like "condemning" and "blasphemy" stand out as moral terms. "Cheered" is used to describe the reaction from advocates, so that's another one. "Punishing" and "repeal" are also in the moral context because they relate to laws and justice.

Then, the resolution mentions "arbiters of religious truth," which is a strong moral statement. "Imposing religious dogma" and "through violence" are definitely moral issues. "Restrictions," "rising," and "alarming" are used to describe the state of religious freedom, so they're moral too.

The examples given include "ban," "extremist," "detention," "blatant," and "oppression." These all have moral connotations. "Egregious acts of persecution" and "violence" are clearly moral terms. "Echoes" is used in the context of support, so it's part of the moral framing. "Civil rights," "endorses," "designate," "persecution," and "oppression" are all moral concepts.

The resolution also mentions "repeal" again and "criminalized," which tie back to the moral aspect of laws and justice. So, compiling all these, I should list each one as the user did.

Next, I need to write a concise summary preserving these moral words. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the bipartisan resolution, the congressmen involved, the countries targeted, the moral issues highlighted, the support from USCIRF, and the international context.

I need to make sure I include the morally framed words without making the summary too long. I'll structure it to mention the resolution, the condemnation of laws, the examples given, the support from the commission, and the international backing from the UN. I'll also note the countries that have repealed such laws and the current status of designations.

Let me draft that, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to make sure it captures the moral framing without unnecessary details.

**SUMMARY:**

Two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution, House Resolution 512, condemning "blasphemy" laws and urging over 70 countries to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights that such laws inappropriately position governments as "arbiters of religious truth" and enable officials to "impose religious dogma" or "violence" on individuals or minorities. It cites alarming reports of rising "restrictions" on religious freedom, such as Russia's "ban" on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of "blatant" blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has "cheered" the resolution, stating that such laws often "weaponize" against marginalized communities and calling for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy charges. The resolution aligns with the UN's protection of civil rights for religious practice and could add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have repealed blasphemy laws, others, such as Russia, Pakistan, and China, remain under scrutiny. END OF SUMMARY.
