SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence or government-sanctioned force. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan employing blasphemy laws to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and is supported by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which helps raise awareness of the persecution and violence legitimized by these laws. The resolution upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, endorsed by international covenants, and aims to add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." Some nations have already taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws, including Ireland, Greece, and Canada, setting a positive example for protecting religious freedom and expression.
END OF SUMMARY.
