Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They're urging countries to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, like blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution mentions specific examples like Russia, China, and Pakistan. It also highlights the support from religious freedom groups and the UN's stance on civil rights.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words used by the author: punishing, empower, impose, violence, sanctioned, ban, detention, use, weaponized, target, support, persecution, legitimize, held, taken, repeal, repealing, criminalized. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should structure the summary to first mention the resolution, then the congressmen, the call to action, the examples given, the support from USCIRF, the UN's role, the impact on countries, and the positive actions by some nations like Ireland and Canada.

Let me make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key moral terms. I'll start with the resolution, then the countries targeted, the consequences, the support, and the UN's involvement. Finally, I'll note the nations that have repealed such laws.

I think that covers all the important points while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me put it all together in a clear and concise manner.

SUMMARY: Two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning "blasphemy" laws, urging over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how such laws empower governments to impose religious dogma and violence, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws. Religious freedom advocates, including the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), support the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held under these laws. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and could add blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as reasons for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." While 10 nations are currently designated, the resolution aims to raise awareness of persecution and violence legitimized by such laws. Some countries, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have already repealed blasphemy laws, with Ireland criminalizing blasphemy until 2009 and Canada until 2018. END OF SUMMARY.
