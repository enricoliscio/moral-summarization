SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning “blasphemy” laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that these laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence and sanctions. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan cited as examples. The resolution also applauds nations that have taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. Religious liberty advocates, including the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), have cheered the resolution, stating that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities and calling for the release of all prisoners held on such charges. The resolution upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, as protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
