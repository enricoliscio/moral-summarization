Alright, I need to summarize this news article about a bipartisan resolution regarding blasphemy laws. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

So, two congressmen, one Democrat from Maryland and a Republican chair of the Freedom Caucus, introduced House Resolution 512. This resolution condemns blasphemy laws and urges over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent. The resolution mentions specific examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws. It also notes that the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom supports the resolution, highlighting that these laws often target marginalized communities.

The article also mentions that the resolution aligns with the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protects religious freedom. It adds blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." Currently, 10 countries are on this list, but the resolution could expand it.

Additionally, the resolution points out that some countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada have already repealed their blasphemy laws, which is a positive step.

I need to condense all this information into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the main points: the introduction of the resolution by bipartisan congressmen, the call to repeal laws, examples of countries with problematic laws, support from USCIRF, alignment with UN standards, the designation of countries, and examples of countries that have repealed such laws.

I should make sure the summary is concise, includes all key elements, and flows logically. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important point is covered without going into too much detail.

The resolution highlights examples such as Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to numerous imprisonments. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating that such laws often target marginalized communities.
