Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article mentions two congressmen, one Democrat and one Republican, introducing a resolution called House Resolution 512. They're targeting over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, like blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution argues that these laws let governments act as religious authorities, which is problematic.

I should note the key points: the bipartisan nature, the target countries, the moral stance against government interference in religion, examples like Russia, China, and Pakistan, the support from USCIRF, the UN's stance, and the countries that have already repealed such laws.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral argument against these laws, emphasizing freedom and the dangers of government overreach. Also, mention the support from international bodies and the countries that have reformed their laws.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the resolution, its purpose, the moral argument, examples of oppressive laws, international support, and the positive examples of countries repealing such laws. Keep it clear and to the point, ensuring the moral framing is evident throughout.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning "blasphemy" laws, urging over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, such as blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how these laws enable governments to impose religious dogma and violence, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to death sentences. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held under such laws and emphasizing that they often target marginalized communities. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and could expand the list of "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom to include nations like Russia, Pakistan, and China. It also notes positive steps taken by countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada to repeal blasphemy laws, reflecting a growing global push for religious freedom and against oppressive legal frameworks. END OF SUMMARY.
