SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning “blasphemy” laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence sanctioned by the state. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan employing blasphemy laws to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution also applauds nations like Ireland, Greece, and Canada that have taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws. It calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and urges Congress to add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." Religious liberty advocates, such as the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, have cheered the resolution, stating that it will help raise awareness of the persecution and violence legitimized by blasphemy laws.
END OF SUMMARY.
