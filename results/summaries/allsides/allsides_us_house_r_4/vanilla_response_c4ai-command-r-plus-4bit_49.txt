SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution, House Resolution 512, recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence. It cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions in countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan, where religious minorities are persecuted and imprisoned under blasphemy laws. The resolution is supported by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy charges. It also upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression as outlined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The resolution further notes nations that have taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws, including Ireland, Greece, and Canada.
