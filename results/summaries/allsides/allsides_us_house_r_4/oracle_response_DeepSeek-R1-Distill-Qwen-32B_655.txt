Alright, I need to summarize the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words listed. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They're condemning laws that punish religious dissent. The key points are the introduction of HR 512, the countries involved, and the support from religious freedom groups.

I should highlight the moral aspects using words like "punishing," "empower," "impose," "violence," etc. I need to mention the resolution's stance against governments acting as religious arbiters, the examples of countries with problematic laws, and the support from USCIRF and the UN.

I should also note the progress in repealing such laws in countries like Ireland and Canada. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the specified moral terms as possible.

Let me structure this: start with the resolution, mention the lawmakers, the purpose, examples of countries, the impact, support from organizations, and the call for action. Make sure to include the morally charged words throughout.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution, HR 512, condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how such laws empower governments to impose religious dogma and violence, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws, where 40 individuals were on death row as of 2018. Religious freedom advocates, including the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), support the resolution, calling it a step to raise awareness of persecution and legitimize violence against marginalized communities. The resolution aligns with the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which upholds civil rights for religious practice. It also proposes adding blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as grounds for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have repealed blasphemy laws, others, including Russia, Pakistan, and China, remain on the list of concern. The resolution aims to end the criminalization of religious dissent and support global religious freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
