SUMMARY: 
Congressmen Raskin and Meadows introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately empower governments as arbiters of religious truth and enable them to impose dogma on individuals or minorities through violence sanctioned by the state. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with alarming reports from watchdogs citing examples such as Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, resulting in approximately 40 individuals on death row. The resolution is endorsed by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which cheers the move as a way to raise awareness of the egregious persecution and violence legitimized by these laws. The resolution also upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, with the President and Secretary of State able to designate countries of particular concern for religious freedom. USIRF has requested that 16 nations, including Russia, Pakistan, and China, be added to this list. Ireland, Greece, and Canada are praised for repealing blasphemy laws, with Ireland recently passing legislation to that effect. Canada also repealed its criminalization of "blasphemous libel" in 2018, ending a long-standing but unused law. END OF SUMMARY.
