SUMMARY:

Two US congressmen, Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent. The resolution, HR 512, calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws criminalizing blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy, citing examples of human rights abuses in Russia, China, and Pakistan. The resolution argues that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom has endorsed the resolution, saying it will help raise awareness of persecution and violence legitimized by these laws. The resolution also notes nations that have repealed blasphemy laws, including Ireland, Greece, and Canada. If passed, the resolution would add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom.
