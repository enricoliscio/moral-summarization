SUMMARY:

A bipartisan resolution introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows condemns "blasphemy" laws, which punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal these laws, which inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence sanctioned by the government. The resolution cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, the detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims in China, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom cheered the resolution, saying such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution urges the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and supports countries that have taken steps to repeal these laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada.
