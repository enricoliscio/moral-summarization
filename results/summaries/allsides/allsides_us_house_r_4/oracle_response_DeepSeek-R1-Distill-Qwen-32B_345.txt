Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. The article is about two congressmen introducing a resolution against blasphemy laws. 

First, I need to understand the key points. The resolution is bipartisan, introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows. It condemns blasphemy laws and urges governments to repeal them. The article mentions specific countries like Pakistan, China, and Russia with examples of religious persecution. It also notes that some countries have repealed such laws, like Ireland and Canada. 

The user emphasized preserving the moral words used in the article. They listed words like "punishing," "empower," "impose," "violence," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary without losing their moral connotations.

I should structure the summary to highlight the resolution's purpose, the countries affected, the support from organizations, and the positive steps taken by some nations. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by mentioning the bipartisan resolution, the congressmen involved, and the main goal. Then, I'll list the problematic countries and their actions. Next, I'll include the support from USCIRF and the UN's stance. Finally, I'll note the countries that have repealed their laws to show progress.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and impactful, using the moral terms as specified. Let me make sure each sentence flows logically and covers all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning "blasphemy" laws, which they argue "punish religious dissent" and "empower governments to impose religious dogma" or "sanction violence." The resolution targets laws criminalizing blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy in over 70 countries, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to imprisonment or death sentences. Religious freedom advocates, including the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), support the resolution, calling such laws "weaponized" tools to "target marginalized communities" and "legitimize persecution." The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and seeks to add blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as criteria for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have "repealed" or "criminalized" blasphemy laws, others continue to enforce them, highlighting the need for global action to "protect" religious freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
