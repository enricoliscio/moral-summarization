SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution in the House of Representatives condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on governments worldwide to repeal such legislation. The resolution, HR 512, recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws inappropriately empower governments and officials to impose religious dogma and sanction violence. It cites alarming reports of increasing religious freedom restrictions, such as Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and the detention of Uighur Muslims in China. The resolution also references the widespread use of blasphemy laws in Pakistan, where individuals have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has praised the resolution, stating that these laws are often used to target marginalized religious communities. HR 512 upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, as endorsed by international covenants and the federal religious freedom act. It calls for the inclusion of blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." The resolution also acknowledges nations that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, setting a positive example for upholding religious freedom and expression.

END OF SUMMARY.
