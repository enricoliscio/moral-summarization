SUMMARY: Congressmen Jamie Raskin and Mark Meadows have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal legislation punishing religious dissent. The resolution recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence sanctioned by the state. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, and the resolution cites alarming reports of persecution, including in Russia, China, and Pakistan. The resolution is endorsed by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. The resolution also recognizes nations that have taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws and seeks to add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." The bipartisan effort is a stand against the egregious acts of violence and oppression that these laws legitimize, and a step towards protecting religious freedom worldwide. END OF SUMMARY.
