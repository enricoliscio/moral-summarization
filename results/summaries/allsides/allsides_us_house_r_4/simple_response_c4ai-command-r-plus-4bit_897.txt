SUMMARY: Two US congressman have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning “blasphemy” laws, a move that has been praised by religious liberty advocates. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that these laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence or state-sanctioned force. It also cites alarming reports of increasing restrictions on religious freedom worldwide, including in Russia, China, and Pakistan, where individuals have been detained, imprisoned, or even sentenced to death for blasphemy. The resolution has been endorsed by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which stated that blasphemy laws are often used to target marginalized religious communities. It also notes countries that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. This resolution is a moral stand for religious freedom and against state-sanctioned religious persecution and violence worldwide.
END OF SUMMARY.
