SUMMARY:

Two US congressmen, Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws, which restrict religious freedom and empower governments to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. It cites alarming examples, such as Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws, which have led to the imprisonment of nearly 40 individuals on death row or serving life sentences. The resolution is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who argue that such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities and legitimize persecution. The resolution upholds the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and calls for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. END OF SUMMARY.
