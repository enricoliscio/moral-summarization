Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about a bipartisan resolution introduced by two congressmen regarding blasphemy laws. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article mentions that Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows introduced House Resolution 512. It's a bipartisan move, which is notable because they're from different parties. The resolution condemns blasphemy laws and calls on over 70 countries to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy.

The resolution states that these laws position governments as arbiters of religious truth, which is problematic because it can lead to oppression of minorities. It cites examples from Russia, China, and Pakistan, where such laws have been used against religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses, Uighur Muslims, and others. It also mentions that in Pakistan, about 40 people were on death row for blasphemy as of 2018.

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, saying these laws are often used to target marginalized communities. The resolution aligns with UN human rights articles and suggests adding blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as reasons for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." Currently, only 10 out of 16 recommended countries are designated.

The article also notes that some countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada have repealed their blasphemy laws. Ireland did so in 2009, and Canada stopped enforcing theirs in 2018.

So, putting this together, the summary should include the introduction of the resolution, its purpose, the countries it targets, the support from USCIRF, the UN alignment, the current CPC designations, and examples of countries that have repealed such laws.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without getting too detailed. I'll start by mentioning the bipartisan resolution, its aim, the congressmen involved, the countries targeted, the examples given, support from USCIRF, the UN references, the current CPC status, and the positive examples of countries repealing the laws.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the introduction of the resolution, moving to its implications, the support, and the outcomes or examples. That should cover all the necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning blasphemy laws and urging over 70 countries to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how such laws enable governments to enforce religious dogma, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to death sentences for 40 individuals. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating that these laws often target marginalized communities. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and proposes adding blasphemy-related offenses as grounds for designating countries as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom. Currently, 10 countries, including China and Pakistan, are designated under this category. The resolution also notes positive steps by countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, which have repealed blasphemy laws. END OF SUMMARY.
