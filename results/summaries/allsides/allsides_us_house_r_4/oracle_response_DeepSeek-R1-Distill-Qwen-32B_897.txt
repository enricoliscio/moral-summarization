Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to use. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about two congressmen introducing a resolution against blasphemy laws, supported by religious freedom groups. They mention specific countries and the impact of these laws. 

I need to make sure to include as many of the moral words as possible. Words like "punishing," "empower," "impose," "violence," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the bipartisan effort, the countries involved, and the consequences of these laws. Also, mention the support from USCIRF and the UN, and the examples of countries repealing such laws.

I'll start by introducing the resolution, then list the countries and examples, then the support and the resolution's goals. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure to incorporate the moral terms and maintain the flow.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution, House Resolution 512, condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how such laws enable governments to "punish" dissent, "empower" officials to "impose" religious dogma, and "sanction" violence against individuals or minorities. It cites examples like Russia's "ban" on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's "detention" of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's "use" of blasphemy laws, which have led to "persecution" and "violence." The resolution is supported by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which warns that these laws are often "weaponized" to "target" marginalized communities. The UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also upholds religious freedom, and the resolution seeks to add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as grounds for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have "repealed" blasphemy laws, others, including Russia, Pakistan, and China, remain on the "list of concern." The resolution calls for the "release" of those "held" on blasphemy charges and aims to "raise awareness" of the "egregious" impact of such laws. END OF SUMMARY.
