Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

Two congressmen, one Democrat and one Republican, introduced a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They want countries to repeal laws that punish religious dissent. The resolution mentions how these laws let governments impose religious dogma and use violence. It cites examples like Russia banning Jehovah's Witnesses, China detaining Uighurs, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws leading to death sentences. 

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom supports the resolution, saying these laws target marginalized groups. The resolution also aligns with UN human rights covenants. It suggests adding countries with such laws to a list of concern, like Russia and Pakistan. Some countries like Ireland and Canada have already repealed their blasphemy laws.

I need to include the morally framed words: blasphemy, heresy, apostasy, position, empower, impose, violence, restrictions, ban, detention, use, weaponized, target, bipartisan, persecution, legitimize, released, uphold, repeal, criminalized. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the bipartisan effort, the problematic laws, the consequences, and the support from organizations. Also, mention the examples and the call for repeal. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me start drafting: 

Two congressmen introduced a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws, which position governments as religious arbiters. These laws empower officials to impose dogma and violence. Examples include Russia's ban, China's detention, and Pakistan's death sentences. The resolution is supported by USCIRF, highlighting how laws target marginalized communities. It calls for repealing these laws and aligns with UN rights. Countries like Ireland and Canada have already repealed theirs. The resolution aims to raise awareness and promote religious freedom globally.

Wait, I need to include more details like the number of countries targeted and the UN articles. Also, mention the 40 individuals on death row in Pakistan. Maybe add that the resolution seeks to add blasphemy as a reason for designating countries of concern. 

Let me try again:

Two congressmen introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws, arguing they position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose dogma through violence. The resolution cites examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighurs, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws leading to death sentences for 40 individuals. USCIRF supports the resolution, stating such laws weaponize against marginalized groups. It aligns with UN human rights and calls for repealing these laws. Ireland and Canada have already repealed theirs. The resolution aims to raise awareness and promote religious freedom globally by targeting countries with such laws.

That's about 150 words. I think that covers all the key points and includes the moral framing words.
