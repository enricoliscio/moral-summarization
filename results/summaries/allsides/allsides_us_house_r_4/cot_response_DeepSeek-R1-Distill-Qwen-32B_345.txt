Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify the morally framed words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about two congressmen introducing a resolution against "blasphemy" laws. They're condemning these laws, which religious liberty advocates support. The resolution mentions that these laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth. It also cites examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws. The resolution is supported by the USCIRF, which says these laws target marginalized communities. The UN's articles support civil rights for religious practice, and the resolution adds blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons to designate countries as "countries of particular concern." Some countries have repealed such laws, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada.

Now, for the first step, I need to list all the single words that are morally framed. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

"condemning" – that's a moral judgment.
"cheered" – positive moral support.
"inappropriately" – implies something wrong.
"oppress" – definitely a moral term.
"target" – as in targeting marginalized groups, which is a moral issue.
"persecution" – a strong moral term.
"egregious" – something very wrong.
"weaponized" – using something for harmful purposes.
"repeal" – the action is seen as positive.
"marginalized" – refers to vulnerable groups, a moral concern.
"uphold" – supporting rights, a positive action.
"criminalized" – making something illegal, which has moral implications.
"conviction" – relates to justice, a moral system.

Wait, I think I might have missed some. Let me check again. The article mentions "condemning," "cheered," "inappropriately," "oppress," "target," "persecution," "egregious," "weaponized," "repeal," "marginalized," "uphold," "criminalized," and "conviction." Also, "designate" could be considered as it's about labeling countries negatively, but I'm not sure if it's a moral term. Maybe not. "Endorse" is another one, as it's about supporting something morally.

Wait, in the original response, the user listed "condemning," "cheered," "inappropriately," "oppress," "target," "persecution," "egregious," "weaponized," "repeal," "marginalized," "uphold," "criminalized," "conviction." So I think that's accurate.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll start by stating the resolution was introduced by two congressmen, its purpose, the support it has, the examples cited, the support from USCIRF, the UN's stance, the countries on the concern list, and the positive examples of countries repealing the laws.

I should make sure to include the moral framing words to reflect the author's perspective. So, I'll mention the resolution condemns blasphemy laws, cheered by advocates, inappropriately positioning governments, oppressing minorities, targeting marginalized communities, persecution, egregious acts, weaponized laws, repeal, marginalized groups, uphold rights, criminalized, and convictions.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with the introduction of the resolution, its purpose, the support, the examples, the UN's role, the countries affected, and the positive steps taken by some nations.

I need to ensure it's concise, under 200 words, and retains the moral perspective. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is included without being too verbose.

**Summary:**

Two congressmen have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws, a move cheered by religious liberty advocates. The resolution calls for the repeal of laws punishing religious dissent, such as blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy, arguing they inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth, oppressing minorities. It cites examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to imprisonment or death. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating such laws target marginalized communities, perpetuating persecution. The United Nations upholds civil rights for religious practice, and the resolution adds blasphemy-related offenses as reasons to designate countries as "countries of particular concern." While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have repealed such laws, others remain on the concern list. The resolution aims to raise awareness of these egregious acts and promote religious freedom globally.
