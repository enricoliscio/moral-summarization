SUMMARY:

In a rare display of bipartisanship, two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution, backed by religious liberty advocates, urges over 70 governments to repeal such laws, which often target marginalized religious communities. The move comes as religious freedom restrictions are on the rise, with alarming reports of persecution and violence. The resolution cites examples of Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws, which have led to the imprisonment of nearly 40 individuals on death row. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has cheered the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy charges. The resolution also recognizes nations that have taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada.
