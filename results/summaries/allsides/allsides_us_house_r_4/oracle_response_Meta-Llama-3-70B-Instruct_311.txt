SUMMARY:

A bipartisan resolution has been introduced by two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, condemning "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal these laws, which inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through the power of the government or sanctioned violence. The resolution cites alarming examples of religious freedom restrictions, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, the detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims in northwest China, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws, which have led to the persecution of marginalized religious communities. The resolution has received widespread bipartisan support and is endorsed by the United Nations, which upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom.
