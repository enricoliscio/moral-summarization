SUMMARY: Two US congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent. The resolution, House Resolution 512, recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence. It also cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions in countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan. The resolution is supported by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which stated that these laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution also notes nations that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. HR 512 would add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom."
