SUMMARY:
A bipartisan resolution introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows condemns "blasphemy" laws, urging over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth, empowering officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence sanctioned by the government. The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that religious freedom restrictions are on the rise. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom endorses the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. END OF SUMMARY.
