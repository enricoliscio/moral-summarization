SUMMARY:

In a bipartisan effort, two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws that restrict religious freedom. The resolution, HR 512, calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. These laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth, empower officials to impose religious dogma, and legitimize violence against individuals or minorities. The resolution cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws to target marginalized communities. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has cheered the resolution, urging the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. The resolution upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, as enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
