SUMMARY: Two US congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, introduced a bipartisan resolution, HR 512, condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent. The resolution recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws inappropriately empower governments and officials to impose religious dogma and sanction violence. This move is cheered by religious liberty advocates and the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which highlights the egregious acts of persecution and violence that these laws enable. The resolution cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions worldwide, including in Russia, China, and Pakistan, where individuals are imprisoned or sentenced to death for blasphemy. It also applauds nations like Ireland, Greece, and Canada for repealing such laws. The resolution aims to strengthen international support for religious civil rights by adding blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." This moral stance is supported by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. HR 512 is a significant step toward protecting religious minorities and upholding the universal right to freedom of conscience.
END OF SUMMARY.
