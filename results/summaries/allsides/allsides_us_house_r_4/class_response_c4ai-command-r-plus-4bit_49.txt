SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on governments to repeal such laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that these laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence and sanctions. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan employing blasphemy laws to target marginalized religious groups. The resolution cites alarming reports from international watchdog organizations and is endorsed by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). It aims to raise awareness of the persecution and violence legitimized by blasphemy laws and calls for the release of prisoners charged with blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy. The resolution also upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, as protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. By designating countries with blasphemy laws as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom," the resolution seeks to address the growing restrictions on religious freedom worldwide.

END OF SUMMARY.
