SUMMARY:

In a bipartisan effort, two congressmen have introduced a resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal such laws, recognizing that they inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities. The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that religious freedom restrictions are on the rise. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has also endorsed the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges. The resolution upholds the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and urges countries to repeal such laws, promoting religious freedom and expression.
