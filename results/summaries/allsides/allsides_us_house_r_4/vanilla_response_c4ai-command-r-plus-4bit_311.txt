SUMMARY: Two US congressmen, Democrat Jamie Raskin and Republican Mark Meadows, introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent. The resolution, House Resolution 512, recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence. It cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions in countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan, and expresses support for international covenants upholding civil rights for religious practice and expression. The resolution also notes countries that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. The move has been applauded by religious liberty advocates and the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, who state that blasphemy laws are often used to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and adds these violations as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom."
