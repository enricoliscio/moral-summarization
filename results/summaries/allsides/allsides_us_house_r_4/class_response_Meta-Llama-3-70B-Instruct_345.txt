SUMMARY:

A bipartisan resolution introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows condemns "blasphemy" laws, which punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal these laws, which "inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth" and "empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through the power of the government or through violence sanctioned by the government." The resolution cites alarming reports of religious freedom restrictions, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws, which have led to the imprisonment of nearly 40 individuals on death row. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom cheered the resolution, saying such laws are often "weaponized to target marginalized religious communities" and legitimize "persecution and violence." The resolution upholds the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and calls for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges.
