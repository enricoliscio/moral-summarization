SUMMARY: Two US congressman have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on more than 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan employing blasphemy laws to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and is endorsed by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). It also upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression under international law. This resolution would add blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." Some nations have already taken steps to repeal blasphemy laws, including Ireland, Greece, and Canada. The bipartisan effort to condemn blasphemy laws globally is a welcome step towards protecting religious freedom and preventing persecution of religious minorities.
END OF SUMMARY.
