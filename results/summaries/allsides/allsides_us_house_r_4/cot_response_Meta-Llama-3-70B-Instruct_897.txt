SUMMARY:
A bipartisan resolution introduced by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows condemns "blasphemy" laws, calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through government-sanctioned violence. The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that these laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities, leading to egregious acts of persecution and violence. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws. The resolution calls for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and urges widespread bipartisan support to raise awareness of these egregious acts.
