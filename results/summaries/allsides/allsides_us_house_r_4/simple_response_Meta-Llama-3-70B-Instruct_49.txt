SUMMARY:

In a significant bipartisan effort, two US congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws, which punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution urges over 70 governments to repeal such laws, recognizing that they inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities. The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who highlight the alarming rise of religious freedom restrictions globally. The resolution cites examples of Russia, China, and Pakistan, where such laws have led to persecution and violence against marginalized religious communities. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom has endorsed the resolution, calling for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy charges. The resolution also notes countries that have repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada.
