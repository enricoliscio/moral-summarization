SUMMARY:

In a bipartisan effort, two US congressmen have introduced a resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws, which punish individuals for religious dissent. The resolution urges over 70 governments to repeal such laws, recognizing that they inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities. The move is cheered by religious liberty advocates, who note that such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws. The resolution also acknowledges nations that have taken steps to repeal such laws, including Ireland, Greece, and Canada. By condemning blasphemy laws, the resolution upholds the importance of religious freedom and the protection of marginalized communities.
