Okay, I need to summarize this news article about a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin from Maryland (Democrat) and Rep. Mark Meadows from North Carolina (Republican and Chair of the Freedom Caucus), who introduced House Resolution 512. The resolution condemns blasphemy laws and urges over 70 countries to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy.

The resolution states that these laws allow governments to act as religious arbiters and impose dogma, which is a concern for religious freedom. It cites examples like Russia banning Jehovah’s Witnesses, China detaining Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's use of blasphemy laws, where about 40 people were on death row as of 2018.

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, calling it a step to raise awareness about persecution. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and suggests adding blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as criteria for designating countries as "countries of particular concern."

Currently, only 10 countries are designated, but the resolution aims to expand this list. It also notes that some countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada have repealed blasphemy laws recently.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words, highlighting the bipartisan effort, the resolution's goals, examples of problematic laws, support from USCIRF, alignment with UN standards, and mentions of countries that have repealed such laws.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the resolution, then the key points, examples, and the significance of the resolution in addressing religious freedom issues.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced House Resolution 512, a bipartisan effort condemning blasphemy laws and urging over 70 countries to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, such as blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how these laws enable governments to impose religious dogma, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to death sentences for 40 individuals. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, emphasizing its role in combating persecution. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and proposes adding blasphemy-related offenses as criteria for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." Currently, only 10 nations are on this list, though the resolution aims to expand it. Notably, countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada have recently repealed blasphemy laws, signaling progress in religious freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
