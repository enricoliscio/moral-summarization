SUMMARY: Two congressman, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence and restrictions. It cites alarming examples of religious freedom restrictions, such as Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, resulting in individuals on death row or serving life sentences. The resolution has been cheered by religious liberty advocates and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, who state that these laws are often weaponized to target marginalized communities. It upholds civil rights for religious practice and expression, endorsed by international covenants and federal laws. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and encourages nations to repeal these laws, with Ireland, Greece, and Canada as notable examples. This bipartisan effort aims to raise awareness and address the persecution and violence legitimized by blasphemy laws worldwide.
