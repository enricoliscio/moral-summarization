SUMMARY:

A bipartisan resolution has been introduced in the US House of Representatives, condemning "blasphemy" laws that punish religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, calls on over 70 governments to repeal such laws, which inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on individuals or minorities through violence sanctioned by the government. The resolution cites alarming examples, including Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, the detention of nearly a million Uighur Muslims in China, and Pakistan's use of wide-ranging blasphemy laws, which have led to the imprisonment of individuals on death row or serving life sentences. The resolution has received widespread bipartisan support, with the US Commission on International Religious Freedom cheering the move, saying such laws are often weaponized to target marginalized religious communities. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and urges nations to repeal such laws, which legitimize persecution and violence.
