Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They're from different parties, which is a good sign of cooperation. The resolution condemns laws that punish religious dissent, like blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. It mentions specific examples like Russia banning Jehovah's Witnesses, China detaining Uighurs, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws leading to death sentences. 

The author uses words like "condemn," "restrictions," "ban," "detention," "weaponized," "persecution," and "violence." These words carry strong moral implications, so I need to include as many as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I should structure the summary to highlight the bipartisan effort, the problematic laws, the consequences, and the support from organizations like USCIRF. Also, mention the UN's stance and the countries that have repealed such laws. 

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: introduction of the resolution, the laws it condemns, examples, support from USCIRF, UN's role, and the countries taking steps to repeal. 

Let me make sure to include the morally framed words without losing the essence of the article. I'll start with the congressmen's action, then the content of the resolution, the examples, the support, the UN's part, and conclude with the countries that have repealed the laws.

SUMMARY: Two congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution, House Resolution 512, condemning blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws. The resolution calls on over 70 governments to repeal laws that empower governments to impose religious dogma or violence, citing examples like Russia’s ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses, China’s detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, which have led to death sentences. Religious freedom restrictions are rising globally, and the resolution highlights how such laws are weaponized to target marginalized communities. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, urging the release of prisoners held on blasphemy charges. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and could add blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as reasons for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." While some nations, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have repealed blasphemy laws, others, including Russia, Pakistan, and China, remain on the list of concern. END OF SUMMARY.
