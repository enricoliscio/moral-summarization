Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They're calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, like blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution mentions several countries, like Pakistan, China, and Russia, where these laws are used to oppress minorities. It also talks about the UN's stance and the countries that have already repealed such laws.

I should make sure to include the morally charged words like "blasphemy," "heresy," "apostasy," "impose," "violence," "restrictions," "ban," "detention," "weaponized," "persecution," "uphold," "repeal," and "criminalized." The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and include the key points: who introduced the resolution, what it aims to do, the countries involved, the UN's support, and the impact on religious freedom.

I'll start by stating that two congressmen introduced the resolution, then mention the countries they're targeting. I'll include the examples like Pakistan's death row cases and China's detention of Uighurs. Then, I'll note the support from USCIRF and the UN, the current CPC designations, and the countries that have repealed such laws. I'll make sure to highlight the moral issues like oppression and persecution, using the specified words.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution, HR 512, condemning "blasphemy," "heresy," and "apostasy" laws, which they argue "inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth" and enable "imposition of religious dogma" or "violence." The resolution targets over 70 countries, citing examples like Pakistan's death row cases for blasphemy, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses. It calls for the repeal of such laws, which often "weaponize" religious restrictions to "target" marginalized communities, perpetuating "persecution" and "oppression." The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and the United Nations support the resolution, emphasizing the need to "uphold" religious freedom rights. While some countries, like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, have repealed blasphemy laws, others remain on the "countries of particular concern" list for religious freedom violations. The resolution aims to raise awareness and push for "repeal" of these laws, highlighting the moral imperative to protect religious dissent and prevent "criminalization" of faith. END OF SUMMARY.
