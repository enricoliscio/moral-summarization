SUMMARY: 
Two US congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, introduced a bipartisan resolution *condemning* "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws *punishing* religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and *renunciation* of faith. The resolution, House Resolution 512, *recognizes* that such laws *inappropriately position* governments as *arbiters* of religious truth and *empower* officials to *impose* religious dogma, often *targeting* marginalized religious communities. Religious freedom *restrictions* are on the rise globally, according to *alarming* reports, and the resolution *cites* examples such as Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, resulting in *persecution*. The resolution is *cheered* by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which *echoes* the call for the release of prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or *apostasy* charges. The resolution also *upholds* civil rights for religious practice and expression under international law and supports the designation of countries of *particular concern* for religious freedom. This includes nations like Russia, Pakistan, and China, which have been *requested* to be placed on the "nation of particular concern" list due to their draconian laws. The resolution *legitimizes* the *repudiation* of these oppressive laws and *targets* the *marginalized* religious minorities they affect.
END OF SUMMARY.
