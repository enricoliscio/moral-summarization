Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points. The article is about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. One is a Democrat from Maryland, Jamie Raskin, and the other is a Republican, Mark Meadows, who chairs the Freedom Caucus. They're calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws that punish religious dissent, like blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy.

The resolution, HR 512, was introduced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It argues that these laws let governments decide religious truth and enforce it, which is problematic. They mention examples like Russia banning Jehovah's Witnesses, China detaining Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws leading to many on death row or life sentences.

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom supports this, saying these laws target marginalized groups. The resolution aligns with UN human rights articles and suggests adding blasphemy-related issues as grounds for designating countries as "countries of particular concern." Currently, some countries like Pakistan and China are on this list, but others aren't. The resolution also notes positive steps by countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada who have repealed such laws.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main points: who introduced the resolution, what it aims to do, key examples, support from USCIRF, alignment with UN, and the impact on countries' designations. Also, mention the positive actions by some countries. I should keep it concise and clear, making sure all essential elements are included without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin and North Carolina Republican Mark Meadows, have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution highlights how such laws enable governments to enforce religious dogma and violence, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to 40 individuals being on death row or serving life sentences. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating that these laws often target marginalized religious communities. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and proposes adding blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy as grounds for designating countries as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom. Currently, 10 countries, including Pakistan and China, are on this list. The resolution also notes positive steps by countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, which have repealed blasphemy laws. END OF SUMMARY.
