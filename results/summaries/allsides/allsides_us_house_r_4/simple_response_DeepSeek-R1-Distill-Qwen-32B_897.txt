Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about two congressmen introducing a bipartisan resolution against blasphemy laws. They're pushing for countries to repeal these laws because they infringe on religious freedom. 

I need to capture the key points: who introduced the resolution, the purpose, which countries are targeted, and the support it's getting. Also, the moral angle is importantâ€”how these laws are oppressive and target minorities. 

I should mention the bipartisan nature to highlight unity. The examples like Pakistan, Russia, and China are crucial to show the issue's prevalence. Including the support from USCIRF adds credibility. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main elements without getting too detailed. Ending with the positive note about some countries repealing their laws gives a hopeful angle. 

Let me structure it: start with the resolution, its purpose, examples, support, the impact, and the conclusion with countries moving away from such laws. Make sure to keep the moral framing clear throughout.

SUMMARY: Two U.S. congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), have introduced a bipartisan resolution (HR 512) condemning blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws, calling on over 70 countries to repeal such laws. The resolution highlights how these laws enable governments to impose religious dogma or violence, citing examples like Russia's ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, China's detention of Uighur Muslims, and Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which have led to imprisonment or death for individuals. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) supports the resolution, stating that such laws often target marginalized communities. The resolution aligns with UN human rights standards and seeks to expand the list of countries designated as "countries of particular concern" for religious freedom violations to include those enforcing blasphemy laws. While 10 countries are currently on the list, USCIRF has recommended adding 16 more, including Russia, Pakistan, and China. The resolution also notes positive steps by countries like Ireland, Greece, and Canada, which have repealed blasphemy laws. END OF SUMMARY.
