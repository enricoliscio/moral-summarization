SUMMARY: Two US congressmen, Rep. Jamie Raskin and Rep. Mark Meadows, introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning "blasphemy" laws and calling on over 70 governments to repeal laws punishing religious dissent, including blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy. The resolution recognizes that such laws inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious truth and empower them to impose religious dogma through violence. Religious freedom restrictions are on the rise globally, with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan employing these laws to target marginalized religious groups. The resolution is supported by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which aims to raise awareness of the persecution and violence legitimized by blasphemy laws. It also acknowledges nations that have recently repealed blasphemy laws, such as Ireland, Greece, and Canada. The resolution calls for the release of all prisoners held on blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy charges and adds blasphemy, apostasy, and heresy as reasons for nations to be designated as "countries of particular concern for religious freedom." This important resolution highlights the urgent need to protect religious freedom and uphold civil rights for religious practice and expression worldwide.
