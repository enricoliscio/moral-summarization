SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's actions have made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempt to pull the US out of the World Health Organization (WHO) has frayed international bonds and may encourage other nations to follow suit. This could harm the WHO and diminish America's international standing. If a new virus emerges, the US may not receive warnings or support due to its damaged reputation. A second respiratory virus could spread quickly in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are struggling to control COVID-19. The resources used to detect potential viruses have been redirected for COVID-19, making it harder to spot a new virus. However, if people remain vigilant against the current pandemic, they may be guarded against a second respiratory virus. Tests used to diagnose COVID-19 could be tweaked to cover the new pathogen, and existing vaccines could be modified to protect against it.

END OF SUMMARY.
