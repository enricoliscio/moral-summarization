Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about how Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic has made the U.S. more vulnerable. It mentions his attempt to pull out of the WHO, which has frayed international bonds. Words like "failed," "vulnerable," "frayed," "pull," "threat," "disengaging," "harm," "diminish," "mishandled," "bought," "withdrawn," "their," "wearing," and "controlled" are key here. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The article also discusses how the U.S. has mishandled its outbreak, bought up drugs, and withdrawn from alliances, making it less likely to receive help in a new crisis. There's a contrast between countries that have controlled COVID-19 well and those that haven't, like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India. In these struggling countries, a new virus could spread undetected because resources are already stretched thin.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's failures, the impact on international standing, and the vulnerability to a new pandemic. Also, mention the contrast between effective and struggling countries. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of the moral words as possible without making it too long.

Let me start by mentioning Trump's failure and the vulnerability. Then, touch on pulling out of WHO, fraying bonds, and the effects. Include how the U.S. mishandled the outbreak, bought drugs, and withdrew from alliances. Contrast with countries that have controlled COVID-19. Mention the resource strain and difficulty in spotting a new virus.

I think that covers all the key points and includes the necessary moral terms. Now, I'll put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has failed to lead the U.S. effectively during the pandemic, making the country more vulnerable to future crises. His attempt to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, potentially harming global cooperation and diminishing Americaâ€™s international standing. The U.S. has mishandled its outbreak, bought up global drug supplies, and withdrawn from global alliances, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. While a second virus could be contained in countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have controlled COVID-19, it seems less likely in struggling nations like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India. In these places, a new respiratory virus could spread undetected due to exhausted resources, including swabs, workers, and experts, which have been redirected for COVID-19. The U.S. has already failed to marshal adequate resources for the current pandemic, making it even more vulnerable to a second wave. END OF SUMMARY.
