SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempts to withdraw from the World Health Organization have frayed international bonds, which could lead to other nations following suit. This would harm the WHO and further damage America's international standing. A country that has mishandled its own outbreak and withdrawn from global alliances is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. While there is an optimistic scenario where a second virus is rapidly detected and fizzles out due to cautious citizens, this is less likely in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are stretched and struggling. A new virus would be harder to spot, as resources have been redirected for COVID-19, and would further tax the already overwhelmed healthcare system. Trump's actions have put the US in a precarious position, making it more vulnerable to future pandemics.

END OF SUMMARY.
