Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article discusses how Trump's actions have made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. I should highlight his withdrawal from the WHO and the impact on international cooperation. Also, mention the potential consequences like diminished standing and lack of support in a new crisis. I need to include the optimistic scenario if a new virus appears, emphasizing vigilance and testing capabilities. Then, contrast this with the situation in countries like the US, Brazil, etc., where resources are strained. Keep it under 200 words and end with the required tokens. Let me structure it step by step to cover all key points without losing the moral angle.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's failure to effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened the U.S. and its global standing, making it more vulnerable to future health crises. His attempt to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) has strained international cooperation, potentially discouraging other nations from engaging with global health efforts. This could hinder the U.S. from receiving timely warnings or support in a new crisis. While a second virus could be contained if detected early and if people remain vigilant, the U.S. and other struggling nations face challenges due to strained resources and exhausted healthcare workers. Countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have controlled COVID-19, are better positioned to handle a new threat, while the U.S. and others are at greater risk. END OF SUMMARY.
