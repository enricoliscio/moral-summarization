SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempt to pull out of the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, which could lead to other nations following suit. This would further damage America's already damaged international standing, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. The US, which has badly mishandled its own outbreak, is now less prepared to handle a second respiratory virus. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better equipped to handle a new pandemic. A second virus would be harder to spot in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are stretched and struggling. The lack of caution and vigilance in these countries could lead to a new virus spreading rapidly. END OF SUMMARY.
