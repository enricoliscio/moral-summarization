SUMMARY: 

Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempt to pull the US out of the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, causing harm to the organization and diminishing America's already damaged international standing. The US, which has badly mishandled its own outbreak, bought up the world's stock of important drugs, and petulantly withdrawn from global alliances, is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. 

In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to handle a new pandemic. However, in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are stretched and struggling, a new virus could spread undetected, cloaked by the similar symptoms of COVID-19. The resources normally used to detect potential viruses of concern have been redirected for COVID-19, leaving them running out or burning out. 

END OF SUMMARY.
