SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempt to pull the US out of the World Health Organization (WHO) has frayed international bonds, causing harm to the organization and diminishing America's already damaged international standing. The US, which has badly mishandled its own outbreak, bought up the world's stock of important drugs, and petulantly withdrawn from global alliances, is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. The country's failure to adequately marshal resources for COVID-19 has left it unprepared to detect and respond to a new respiratory virus. The same resources, from physical equipment to health-care workers, are either running out or burning out. A second respiratory virus would further tax these resources, making it harder to spot and control. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better equipped to handle a new pandemic.

END OF SUMMARY.
