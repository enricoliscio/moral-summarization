Okay, I need to summarize the given news article, making sure to preserve the moral framing that the author provided. The article talks about how Donald Trump's actions have made the U.S. more vulnerable to another pandemic. I should focus on the key points: Trump pulling out of the WHO, the impact on international cooperation, the U.S.'s damaged standing, and the potential for a second virus to spread undetected. I also need to include the optimistic scenario where vigilance helps prevent another outbreak and the challenges faced by countries like the U.S. due to resource strain. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The article highlights how Donald Trump's leadership has weakened the U.S.'s ability to handle future pandemics. By attempting to withdraw from the World Health Organization, Trump has strained international cooperation, potentially encouraging other nations to disengage from global health efforts. This undermines the U.S.'s already damaged international standing and increases vulnerability to a new crisis. A second virus could spread undetected in countries like the U.S., which has struggled to manage COVID-19, due to strained resources and exhausted healthcare workers. While vigilant measures like social distancing and mask-wearing could help prevent a new outbreak, the optimistic scenario is more achievable in countries that have controlled COVID-19, such as South Korea and Germany. The U.S., however, faces significant challenges in detecting and responding to a new respiratory virus. END OF SUMMARY.
