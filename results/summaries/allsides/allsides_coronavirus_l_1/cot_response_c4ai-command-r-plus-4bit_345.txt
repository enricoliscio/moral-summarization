SUMMARY:
Donald Trump has *failed* to lead the US during the COVID-19 pandemic, making the country more *vulnerable* to another outbreak. His administration has *tried* to pull the US out of the World Health Organization, a move that will *harm* the WHO and *diminish* America's international standing. While other countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany have successfully controlled COVID-19, the US, Brazil, Russia, and India are *stretched* and *struggling*. A second respiratory virus would *tax* the same resources that the US has already *failed* to adequately marshal for COVID-19, potentially *cloaking* its spread. The article discusses the challenges of detecting and responding to a new outbreak, highlighting the importance of vigilance, testing, and vaccination.
