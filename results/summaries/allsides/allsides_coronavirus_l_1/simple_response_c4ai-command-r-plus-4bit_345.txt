SUMMARY: Having bungled the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic, former President Donald Trump has made the country more vulnerable to another global health crisis. His attempts to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, have damaged America's international standing and could hinder its ability to receive warnings or support during a future pandemic. While it's possible that a second respiratory virus could be quickly detected and contained due to increased vigilance and existing diagnostic tests, this optimistic scenario seems less likely in countries like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, which have struggled to control COVID-19. A new virus could spread undetected, cloaked by the focus on COVID-19, and further strain already depleted resources. The moral imperative is clear: nations must learn from their failures during the current pandemic and strengthen their public health systems to protect their citizens and the world from future threats.
END OF SUMMARY.
