SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US vulnerable to another pandemic. His petulant withdrawal from global alliances and attempts to pull out of the World Health Organization have frayed international bonds, damaging America's already vulnerable international standing. The US, which has badly mishandled its own outbreak, is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to handle a new respiratory virus. However, in nations like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are stretched and struggling, a new virus could spread undetected, further taxing already inadequate resources. END OF SUMMARY.
