SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempt to pull the US out of the World Health Organization (WHO) has frayed international bonds, causing harm to the organization and diminishing America's already damaged international standing. This withdrawal has also led to US officials and experts disengaging from international institutions, which may encourage other nations to follow suit. The US, which has badly mishandled its own outbreak and bought up the world's stock of important drugs, is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to handle a new pandemic. The US's failure to adequately marshal resources for COVID-19 has left it ill-equipped to handle a second respiratory virus, making it harder to detect and respond to a new outbreak.

END OF SUMMARY.
