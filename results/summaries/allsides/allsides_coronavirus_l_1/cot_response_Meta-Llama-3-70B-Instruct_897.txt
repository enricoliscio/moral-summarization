SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His decision to pull out of the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, damaging America's already weakened international standing. The US, which has badly mishandled its own outbreak, is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to handle a new respiratory virus. However, in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are stretched and struggling, a new virus could spread undetected, further taxing already depleted resources. The US must be cautious and vigilant to prevent a second pandemic from taking hold. END OF SUMMARY.
