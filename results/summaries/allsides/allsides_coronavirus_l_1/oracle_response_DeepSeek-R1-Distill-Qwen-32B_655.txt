Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about how Trump's handling of the pandemic has made the U.S. vulnerable to another one. He tried to pull out of the WHO, which frayed international bonds. This action might harm the WHO and diminish America's standing. The U.S. mishandled its outbreak, bought up drugs, and withdrew from alliances, making it less likely to get warnings or support in a new crisis. 

The article also mentions that a second virus could be detected if people stay vigilant, but in countries struggling with COVID-19 like the U.S., it might be harder to spot a new virus because resources are already stretched. Tests could be tweaked, and vaccines might be adjusted, but it would take time. The author uses words like failed, vulnerable, frayed, pull, threat, disengaging, harm, diminish, mishandled, bought, withdrawn, their, wearing, controlled.

In the summary, I need to include these words where appropriate. I should structure it to first talk about Trump's failure and the consequences, then mention the possibility of a second virus and the challenges in detecting it. I should keep it concise, under 200 words. 

Let me start by mentioning Trump's failure to lead against the pandemic, making the U.S. vulnerable. Then, his attempt to pull out of the WHO, which frayed international bonds. The effects of disengaging and the threat to the WHO. The U.S. mishandled the outbreak, bought up drugs, withdrew from alliances. Then, the difficulty in detecting a new virus because resources are stretched. Mention the tests and vaccines, but note the challenges in countries struggling with COVID-19. 

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me check the word count as I go. 

Putting it all together, I think the summary provided by the user does a good job. It includes all the key points and the morally framed words. It's concise and under 200 words. I don't see any issues with it, so I can present it as the final answer.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's failure to lead the U.S. effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic has made the country more vulnerable to future crises. His attempt to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization (WHO) has frayed international bonds, potentially disengaging the nation from global health efforts and harming its already diminished international standing. The U.S. has mishandled its own outbreak, bought up global drug stocks, and withdrawn from global alliances, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. A second respiratory virus could spread undetected in countries struggling with COVID-19, as resources like tests and health workers are already stretched thin. While tests could be tweaked to detect new pathogens and vaccines adjusted, the U.S. and other struggling nations may struggle to respond effectively. Countries like South Korea and Germany, which have controlled COVID-19, are better prepared, while the U.S. faces greater risks due to its mishandling of the current pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
