SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US vulnerable to another outbreak. His attempt to pull the US out of the World Health Organization (WHO) has frayed international bonds, causing harm to the global health community. This move will likely diminish America's already damaged international standing, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in the event of a new crisis. The US has failed to adequately marshal resources to combat COVID-19, and a second respiratory virus would further tax these resources. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to handle a new outbreak. The US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are struggling to contain the virus, are more likely to be caught off guard by a new virus. The author warns that the US's failure to prepare for a potential new pandemic is a threat to global health.

END OF SUMMARY.
