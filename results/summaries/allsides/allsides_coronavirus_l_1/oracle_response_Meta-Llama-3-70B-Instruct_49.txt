SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempt to pull the US out of the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, causing harm to the organization and diminishing America's already damaged international standing. This withdrawal has also led to disengagement from international institutions, which may encourage other nations to follow suit. As a result, the US is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. The country's failure to adequately prepare for COVID-19 has depleted resources, making it harder to detect and respond to a new respiratory virus. The US's struggles to control COVID-19, combined with its weakened international standing, make it less likely to effectively respond to a new pandemic. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to respond to a new pandemic.

END OF SUMMARY.
