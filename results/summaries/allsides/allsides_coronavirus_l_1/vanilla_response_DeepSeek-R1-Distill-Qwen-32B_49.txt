Alright, I need to summarize this article about the risks of a second pandemic under Trump's leadership. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Donald Trump failed to handle the first pandemic effectively and made the US more vulnerable to another one. He tried to pull the US out of the WHO, which could harm international cooperation. Experts say this might cause other countries to disengage too, hurting the WHO and US's international standing.

Next, the article mentions that if a new virus emerges, the US might not get warnings or support because of its mishandling of the current pandemic, stockpiling drugs, and leaving global alliances. There's an optimistic scenario where a new virus is detected quickly due to global alertness, but this depends on people staying vigilant with distancing, masks, etc.

It also talks about how COVID-19 tests could be adapted to detect new pathogens, and flu vaccines could be tweaked if needed. Countries like South Korea and Germany have controlled COVID-19 well, making this future more plausible there, but not in countries like the US, Brazil, etc., which are struggling.

The article points out that resources for detecting new viruses have been redirected to COVID-19, making it harder to spot a new virus. The US hasn't managed its resources well for COVID-19, so a second virus would strain them further.

Now, I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's actions weakening international ties, the potential for a new virus to go unnoticed, the optimistic scenario, and the resource strain. I'll make sure to include key points like the WHO withdrawal, resource redirection, and the contrast between well-managed countries and struggling ones.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's failure and its effects on international cooperation. Then mention the potential for a new virus to spread undetected in struggling countries. Highlight the optimistic scenario and the possibility of adapting tests and vaccines. Finally, note the resource strain and the contrast between countries.

I need to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened the U.S. and its international standing, making it more vulnerable to a future crisis. His attempt to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) could reduce global cooperation, harming the WHO and encouraging other nations to disengage. The U.S., which has mishandled its own outbreak and stockpiled drugs, may struggle to receive warnings or support for a new crisis. A second virus could spread undetected in countries like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, which are already overwhelmed. Resources for detecting new pathogens have been redirected to COVID-19, increasing the risk of missing a new outbreak. While tests could be adapted to detect new viruses and flu vaccines tweaked, the U.S. has failed to manage its resources effectively, making a second pandemic more challenging. Countries like South Korea and Germany, which have controlled COVID-19, are better prepared, while others remain vulnerable. END OF SUMMARY.
