Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how Trump's handling of the pandemic has made the U.S. more vulnerable to another outbreak. He tried to pull out of the WHO, which frayed international bonds. The author uses words like "failed," "vulnerable," "frayed," etc.

I need to make sure the summary includes these words. The article also talks about the U.S. mishandling the outbreak, buying up drugs, and withdrawing from alliances, which makes it less likely to get help in a new crisis.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's failures and the resulting vulnerability. Mention the WHO withdrawal, the effects on international standing, and the potential for another virus to spread undetected. Also, include the contrast between countries that handled COVID well and those struggling.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral terms. Check that each sentence flows logically and covers the main ideas without being too verbose.

Finally, I'll make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump has failed to lead the U.S. effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic, making the country more vulnerable to future health crises. His attempt to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization (WHO) has frayed international bonds, diminishing America's global standing. By mishandling the outbreak, buying up global drug supplies, and withdrawing from international alliances, the U.S. risks being unprepared for a new crisis. A second virus could spread undetected, especially in countries like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, which are struggling to control COVID-19. Resources for detecting new viruses have been redirected to COVID-19, leaving nations vulnerable. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have controlled COVID-19, are better prepared. The U.S. must stay vigilant, continue social distancing, and wear masks to guard against a second respiratory virus. However, its failure to adequately marshal resources for COVID-19 leaves it at greater risk. END OF SUMMARY.
