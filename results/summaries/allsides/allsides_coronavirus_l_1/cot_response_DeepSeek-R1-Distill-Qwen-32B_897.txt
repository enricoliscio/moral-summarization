Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a summary preserving those moral words. 

Okay, let me read the article carefully. It's about how Trump's actions have made the U.S. more vulnerable to another pandemic. The morally charged words here would be terms that imply blame, failure, or negative consequences. Words like "failed," "vulnerable," "frayed," "empty," "diminish," "mishandled," "petulantly," "alert," "cautious," "vigilant," "head start," "stretched," "struggling," "cloak," "chance," "tax." These words carry moral judgments about the situation.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these moral words as possible. I should start by highlighting Trump's failure and the consequences, then move to the impact on international standing and resources. Mention the optimistic scenario but note it's less likely in countries like the U.S. due to their current struggles. Finally, touch on the preparedness and resource issues.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without losing the moral framing. Let me structure it step by step: Trump's actions, international disengagement, resource issues, optimistic vs. realistic scenarios, and the conclusion about the U.S. being less prepared.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together.

**STEP 1:**  
* failed  
* vulnerable  
* frayed  
* empty  
* diminish  
* mishandled  
* petulantly  
* alert  
* cautious  
* vigilant  
* head start  
* stretched  
* struggling  
* cloak  
* chance  
* tax  

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump's failure to lead the U.S. effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic has made the nation more vulnerable to future crises. By attempting to withdraw from the World Health Organization, Trump has frayed international bonds, potentially diminishing America's already damaged global standing. The U.S. has mishandled its own outbreak, stockpiled critical drugs, and withdrawn from global alliances, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. While an optimistic scenario exists where a new virus could be contained due to heightened vigilance, this is less likely in countries like the U.S., which are struggling to manage COVID-19. Resources for detecting new viruses have been redirected, and healthcare workers are stretched thin. A second respiratory virus would further tax the same strained resources, highlighting the U.S.'s unpreparedness. END OF SUMMARY.
