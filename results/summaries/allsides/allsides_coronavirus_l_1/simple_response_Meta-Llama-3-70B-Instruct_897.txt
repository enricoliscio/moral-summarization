SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempts to withdraw from the World Health Organization have frayed international bonds and may encourage other nations to follow suit, further diminishing America's international standing. This could lead to a lack of warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. While there is an optimistic scenario where a second virus is rapidly detected and fizzles out due to cautious citizens, the US's struggling response to COVID-19 makes it less likely to effectively respond to a new virus. The country's resources, including healthcare workers and equipment, are already stretched thin and may not be able to detect a new virus in time. This is a moral failure, as the US's actions have consequences not just for its own citizens, but for the global community.

END OF SUMMARY.
