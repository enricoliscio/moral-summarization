SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His decision to pull out of the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, damaging America's already vulnerable international standing. This reckless move will harm the WHO at a time when it is most needed. A country that has badly mishandled its own outbreak and petulantly withdrawn from global alliances is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to tackle a new respiratory virus. However, in nations like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are stretched and struggling, a new virus could spread undetected, further taxing already depleted resources. END OF SUMMARY.
