Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided a specific structure with two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. 

I need to start by understanding what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment, like 'failed,' 'vulnerable,' 'frayed,' etc. I should go through the article and pick out each word that has a moral connotation. 

Looking at the article, the first paragraph talks about Trump failing to lead against a pandemic, making the country vulnerable. So words like 'failed,' 'vulnerable,' 'frayed' come up. I'll list each of these as STEP 1.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, using as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should highlight the main points: Trump's actions weakening the US's position, the impact on international health organizations, the potential for another pandemic, and the strained resources. I should ensure that the moral framing is clear, showing the negative consequences of Trump's policies.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all critical points without being too technical. I'll structure it to first mention Trump's failure, then the withdrawal from WHO, the impact on international standing, the vulnerability to another pandemic, and the strained resources. Finally, I'll contrast this with countries that handled the pandemic well, emphasizing the US's struggling situation.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary concise, making sure it's within the word limit. I'll also ensure that each morally framed word is included where appropriate to maintain the author's original tone and message.

**STEP 1:**  
* failed  
* vulnerable  
* frayed  
* empty  
* disengaging  
* diminish  
* damaged  
* mishandled  
* bought up  
* petulantly  
* withdrawn  
* vigilant  
* guarded  
* alert  
* cloak  
* stretched  
* struggling  
* failed  

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump's failure to lead the U.S. through the COVID-19 pandemic has made the country more vulnerable to future crises. By attempting to withdraw from the World Health Organization, Trump has frayed international bonds, potentially diminishing America's already damaged global standing. The U.S. has mishandled its own outbreak, bought up global drug supplies, and withdrawn from alliances, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. A second virus could spread undetected in countries like the U.S., where resources are stretched and struggling. In contrast, nations like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared. The U.S., however, faces the risk of a new virus emerging unnoticed due to its failed pandemic response and strained resources. END OF SUMMARY.
