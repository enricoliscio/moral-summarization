Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it.

The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. They mentioned that I should list each word with a bullet point under STEP 1. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Looking at the article, it's about how Trump's actions have made the U.S. more vulnerable to another pandemic. The moral framing here is about failure, negligence, and the consequences of poor leadership. Words like "failed," "vulnerable," "frayed," "empty," "damaged," "mishandled," "petulantly," "alert," "vigilant," "head start," "stretched," "struggling," "cloak," "redirected," "failed," and "tax" stand out as morally charged.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these words. I should mention Trump's failure, the impact on international relations, the U.S.'s damaged standing, the mishandling of resources, and the potential for another crisis. I'll also highlight the contrast between countries that handled COVID-19 well and those that didn't, emphasizing the moral implications of the latter.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it by first stating the main issue, then the consequences, and finally the contrasting scenarios. I'll use the identified moral words to convey the severity and the ethical concerns.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the key points with the appropriate moral framing. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. Once done, I'll present the summary after the specified tokens as instructed.

### SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump's failure to lead the U.S. through the COVID-19 pandemic has made the country more vulnerable to future crises. His decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, damaging America's global standing. The U.S. has mishandled its own outbreak, stockpiled drugs, and withdrawn from global alliances, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. A second virus could spread undetected in countries like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, which are struggling to control COVID-19. Resources for detecting new viruses have been redirected to COVID-19, leaving nations vulnerable. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have managed COVID-19 well, are better prepared. The U.S. has failed to marshal adequate resources, making it harder to detect and respond to a new respiratory virus. END OF SUMMARY.
