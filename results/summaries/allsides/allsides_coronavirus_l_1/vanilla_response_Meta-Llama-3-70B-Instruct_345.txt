SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's actions, such as trying to pull the US out of the World Health Organization, have made the country more vulnerable to another pandemic. This move could lead to a decline in international cooperation and damage America's already weakened global standing. If a new respiratory virus emerges, the US may not receive timely warnings or support due to its damaged relationships with other nations. While a vigilant population could theoretically be protected against a second virus, the US's struggles with COVID-19 make it less likely to detect and respond to a new outbreak. Resources, including healthcare workers and equipment, are already stretched thin, making it harder to spot a new virus. In contrast, countries like South Korea and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, may be better equipped to handle a new pandemic.

END OF SUMMARY.
