SUMMARY: Donald Trump's failed leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic has left the United States more vulnerable to a second wave of infections or a new pandemic. His attempts to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) have damaged America's international standing and could hinder its ability to receive warnings or support during a future crisis. While an optimistic scenario involves a vigilant world that quickly detects and contains a new pathogen, the reality in struggling nations like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India paints a different picture. COVID-19 has stretched resources thin, and a second respiratory virus would further tax an already overburdened system. This moral failure of leadership has real consequences for global health and America's reputation.

END OF SUMMARY.
