SUMMARY: Donald Trump has failed to lead the United States through the COVID-19 pandemic, making the country more vulnerable to a second wave or a new outbreak. His administration has frayed international bonds by threatening to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, harming global health efforts when they are most needed and diminishing America's international standing. The U.S. has also mishandled its outbreak response, bought up important drugs, and withdrawn from global alliances. These actions have potential consequences for global cooperation and could impact the country's ability to receive warnings or support during future crises. 

Meanwhile, the ongoing pandemic continues to stretch and struggle in some nations, including the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India. This could provide cover for the spread of a new respiratory virus with similar symptoms, making it harder to detect and control. The same resources needed to detect and respond to potential new viruses of concern are already being redirected for COVID-19 efforts, and healthcare workers and public health experts are running out or burning out. The world remains alert, but a second respiratory virus would further tax the resources that the U.S. has already failed to adequately marshal.
END OF SUMMARY.
