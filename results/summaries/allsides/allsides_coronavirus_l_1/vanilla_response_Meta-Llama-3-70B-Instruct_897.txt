SUMMARY:

The article argues that the US, under Donald Trump's leadership, is more vulnerable to another pandemic due to its mishandling of the current COVID-19 outbreak. The country's international standing has been damaged, and its withdrawal from global alliances may discourage other nations from cooperating. This could lead to a lack of warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. However, if people remain vigilant against the current pandemic, they may also be protected against a second respiratory virus. The same tests used to diagnose COVID-19 could be adapted to detect a new pathogen, and existing vaccines could be tweaked to protect against it. But in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are struggling to control COVID-19, a new virus may spread undetected due to redirected resources and burnout of healthcare workers.

END OF SUMMARY.
