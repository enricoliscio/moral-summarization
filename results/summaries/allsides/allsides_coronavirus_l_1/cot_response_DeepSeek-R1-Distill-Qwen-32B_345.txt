Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses how Trump's actions have made the U.S. more vulnerable to another pandemic. It mentions pulling out of the WHO, which has weakened international cooperation. The author is critical of Trump's leadership, pointing out how this has hurt the U.S.'s global standing.

Next, I should identify the morally framed words. Words like "failed," "frayed," "empty," "mishandled," "petulantly," "alert," "vigilant," "cautious," "alert," "head start," "stretched," "struggling," "cloak," "take off," "taxed," and "adequately" all carry moral connotations. These words highlight the negative consequences of Trump's policies and the U.S.'s poor handling of the pandemic.

Now, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and reflect the author's moral perspective. I'll start by stating how Trump's actions have made the U.S. vulnerable, then mention the withdrawal from the WHO and its effects. I'll note the optimistic scenario if people stay vigilant and the potential for a multiplex test. However, the U.S. is struggling, so a new virus could spread unnoticed. I'll conclude by emphasizing the strained resources and the failure to prepare adequately.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too technical. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article. Let me piece it together, ensuring each sentence captures the moral framing and the main ideas.

**STEP 1:**  
* Failed  
* Frayed  
* Empty  
* Mishandled  
* Petulantly  
* Alert  
* Vigilant  
* Cautious  
* Alert  
* Head start  
* Stretched  
* Struggling  
* Cloak  
* Take off  
* Taxed  
* Adequately  

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump's leadership has left the U.S. more vulnerable to a second pandemic by fraying international bonds, such as attempting to pull out of the WHO, which has diminished America's global standing. The U.S. has mishandled its own outbreak, bought up global drug stocks, and withdrawn from alliances, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. While an optimistic scenario exists where a new virus is detected early due to vigilant behavior, the U.S. is struggling to manage its current pandemic, making it harder to spot a new virus. Resources like swabs, workers, and experts are either running out or burning out, leaving the U.S. ill-prepared for a second respiratory virus. END OF SUMMARY.
