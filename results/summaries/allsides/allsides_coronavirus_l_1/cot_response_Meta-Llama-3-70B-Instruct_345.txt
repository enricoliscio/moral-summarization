SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the US more vulnerable to another pandemic. His attempts to pull out of the World Health Organization have frayed international bonds, further damaging America's already damaged international standing. A country that has badly mishandled its own outbreak and petulantly withdrawn from global alliances is less likely to receive warnings or support if a new crisis emerges. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have successfully controlled COVID-19, are better prepared to handle a new respiratory virus. However, in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia, and India, which are stretched and struggling, a new virus could spread undetected, cloaked by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
