Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about how Donald Trump's actions have made the U.S. more vulnerable to another pandemic. He tried to pull out of the WHO, which has weakened international cooperation. Experts mention that this could have immediate effects, even if the withdrawal isn't legally possible yet. The U.S. mishandling of COVID-19, stockpiling drugs, and leaving global alliances makes it less likely to get support in a new crisis. 

The article also discusses the optimistic scenario where a new virus is detected quickly and doesn't spread because people are vigilant. Tests could be adjusted to detect multiple viruses, and flu vaccines might be tweaked. Countries like South Korea and Germany are better prepared, while the U.S. and others are struggling. Their resources are stretched, making it harder to spot a new virus.

I should structure the summary to cover Trump's actions, the impact on international relations, the potential for another pandemic, and the differing readiness of countries. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all key points.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened the U.S.'s ability to respond to a potential second outbreak. His attempt to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) has strained international cooperation, further damaging America's global standing. The U.S. has mishandled its own outbreak, stockpiled drugs, and withdrawn from global alliances, making it less likely to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. A new virus could spread undetected in countries like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, where resources are stretched. However, a new pathogen might be detected early in vigilant countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany. Tests could be adjusted to detect multiple viruses, and flu vaccines might be tweaked to protect against a new strain, though this would take time. The U.S. has failed to adequately marshal resources for COVID-19, making it even more vulnerable to a second respiratory virus. END OF SUMMARY.
