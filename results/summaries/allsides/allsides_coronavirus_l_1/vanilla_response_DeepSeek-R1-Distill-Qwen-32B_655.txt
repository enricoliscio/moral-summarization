Okay, I need to summarize this article about the risk of a second pandemic under Trump's leadership. The user provided the article, so I should read through it carefully.

The article talks about how Trump's actions, like trying to leave the WHO, have weakened international cooperation. That makes the US more vulnerable. I should note that. Also, the article mentions that without proper international ties, the US might not get warnings or support in a new crisis.

Then, there's an optimistic scenario where a new virus is detected early because people are vigilant. But that's more likely in countries that handled COVID well, not the US. The US is struggling, so a new virus could spread unnoticed.

The article also discusses how current COVID tests could be adapted for a new virus, but the US lacks the resources. Testing equipment and healthcare workers are stretched thin, so a second virus would be hard to spot.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention Trump's actions, the impact on international standing, the optimistic vs. pessimistic scenarios, and the resource limitations.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's failure, then his actions, the consequences, the optimistic possibility, and the challenges in the US. Make sure it's concise and covers all key points.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened the U.S.'s ability to respond to a potential second outbreak. By threatening to withdraw from the World Health Organization, Trump has strained international cooperation, reducing the U.S.'s global influence and its ability to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. A second virus could spread undetected in countries struggling with COVID-19, like the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and India, due to exhausted resources and overwhelmed healthcare systems. While existing COVID-19 tests could potentially detect a new pathogen, the U.S. lacks the infrastructure and personnel to effectively monitor and respond. A vigilant public could theoretically limit the spread of a new virus, but the U.S.'s current state of preparedness makes this unlikely. END OF SUMMARY.
