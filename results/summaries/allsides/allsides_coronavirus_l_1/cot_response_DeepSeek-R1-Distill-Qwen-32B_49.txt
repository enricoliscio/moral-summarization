Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the text. Then, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to spot words with moral connotations. Words like "failed," "vulnerable," "frayed," "empty," "mishandled," "petulantly," "alert," "vigilant," "careful," "head start," "struggling," "cloak," "chance," "tax." These words carry moral judgments about actions or states.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes these words. The article talks about Trump's actions weakening the US's position, making it vulnerable to another pandemic. It mentions the withdrawal from WHO, which is seen negatively. The summary should highlight how these actions have negative consequences, like diminished standing and less support in a new crisis. Also, it should note the contrast between countries that handled COVID well and those that didn't, affecting their ability to detect new viruses.

I'll structure the summary to start with Trump's failure, mention the withdrawal from WHO, the effects on international standing, the mishandling of the outbreak, and the potential for a new virus to spread unnoticed. I'll include the optimistic scenario but note it's harder in countries like the US. I'll end by mentioning the taxed resources, using the word "tax."

Let me make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without exceeding 200 words. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms.

**STEP 1:**  
* failed  
* vulnerable  
* frayed  
* empty  
* mishandled  
* petulantly  
* alert  
* vigilant  
* careful  
* head start  
* struggling  
* cloak  
* chance  
* tax  

**SUMMARY:**  
Donald Trump's failure to lead the U.S. effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic has made the country more vulnerable to future crises. His attempt to withdraw from the World Health Organization has frayed international bonds, potentially diminishing America's global standing and leaving it less prepared for a new outbreak. The U.S. has mishandled its own pandemic response, bought up critical drugs, and withdrawn from global alliances, making it harder to receive warnings or support in a new crisis. While an alert world could theoretically detect and contain a new virus, the U.S. and other struggling nations like Brazil, Russia, and India are particularly vulnerable. Their stretched resources, including swabs, healthcare workers, and public health experts, are already taxed by COVID-19, making it harder to detect a new respiratory virus. END OF SUMMARY.
