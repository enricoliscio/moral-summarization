SUMMARY: Having failed to lead the best-prepared nation in the world against the COVID-19 pandemic, former President Donald Trump has made the United States more vulnerable to other public health threats. His administration's attempts to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) have frayed international bonds and harmed America's global standing. This could diminish the country's ability to receive warnings or support during future crises. 

While it is possible that a second respiratory virus could be controlled through vigilant adherence to public health measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing, the U.S. has already struggled to effectively marshal resources for COVID-19. A new virus would strain these resources further and could spread undetected, especially in countries like the U.S. that have mishandled their outbreak responses. 

The article discusses the potential challenges of detecting and responding to a new respiratory virus, highlighting the importance of international cooperation and responsible leadership in safeguarding public health.
