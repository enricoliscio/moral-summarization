Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about how Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic has made the U.S. more vulnerable to another one. It mentions his attempt to pull out of the WHO, which has weakened international cooperation. The author is critical of Trump's actions, highlighting how this could harm the U.S. and global health efforts.

I should note the key points: Trump's failure to lead effectively, the impact on international relations, the potential for another pandemic, and the lack of preparedness in the U.S. compared to other countries. Also, the moral angle is about the consequences of poor leadership and the importance of international cooperation.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main ideas: Trump's actions weakening the U.S., the impact on global health, the possibility of another virus, and the contrast between prepared and unprepared countries.

I should make sure to include the moral implications, like how the U.S. mishandling sets a bad example and endangers global health. Also, mention the technical aspects like testing and vaccine development, but keep it concise.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's failure, moving to the consequences, and ending with the potential outcomes depending on the country's preparedness.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the moral and practical consequences of Donald Trump's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has made the U.S. more vulnerable to future health crises. Trump's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) has weakened international cooperation, harming global health efforts and diminishing America's international standing. This failure to lead has discouraged other nations from collaborating, potentially hindering early detection and containment of new pathogens. The U.S., already struggling with its own pandemic response, risks being unprepared for a second respiratory virus due to exhausted resources and overwhelmed healthcare systems. In contrast, countries like South Korea, New Zealand, and Germany, which have managed COVID-19 effectively, are better positioned to handle a new crisis. The article underscores the importance of vigilance, international cooperation, and resource allocation in preventing future pandemics. Trump's actions have set a dangerous precedent, highlighting the moral responsibility of leadership to prioritize global health and preparedness. END OF SUMMARY.
