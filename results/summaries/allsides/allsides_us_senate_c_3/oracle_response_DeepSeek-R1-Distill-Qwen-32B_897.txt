Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral language involved.

The article is about the U.S. government shutdown, the longest in history, caused by a budget standoff, particularly over funding for the border wall. The Senate is set to vote on two bills: one offering $5.7 billion for the wall and other concessions, and another short-term measure to reopen the government. There's a lot of political tension, with accusations of complicity, holding the government hostage, and playing politics.

I should identify the morally charged words the author used: ending, standoff, shutdown, threatened, end, put, reopen, complicity, chaos, suffering, holding, hostage, push, looking, out, offer, open, putting, playing, done, protection, brought, aid, attack, illegal, destroy, ushered, closing.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without making it too long. I'll focus on the main actions and the moral implications each side presents. I'll mention the Senate's votes, the bills, the threats of veto, the accusations of complicity, the suffering caused by the shutdown, and the differing approaches from House Democrats and centrists.

I should structure the summary to show the ongoing standoff, the attempts to end it, the moral accusations, and the consequences of the shutdown. I'll make sure to include words like "shutdown," "standoff," "complicity," "hostage," "chaos," "suffering," "offer," "reopen," and "destroy" to reflect the moral framing.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly. I'll start with the Senate's upcoming vote, then the content of the bills, the threats, the accusations, and the consequences. I'll conclude with the differing approaches and the impact on asylum policies.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary moral terms. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. government shutdown, now in its 32nd day, is the longest in history, caused by a budget standoff over border wall funding. The Senate will vote on two bills: one offering $5.7 billion for the wall and other concessions, and another short-term measure to reopen the government until Feb. 8. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of complicity in the shutdown. President Trump threatened to veto the short-term measure, and House Democrats proposed a spending bill without wall funding, which is unlikely to pass the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise, offering a vote on a border wall next month if the government reopens. Trump accused Democrats of playing politics, insisting the wall is essential for national security. The Senate bill includes $5.7 billion for the wall, three years of protection for young immigrants, and disaster aid, but critics label it a "Trojan Horse" for destroying asylum protections. House Democratsâ€™ bill focuses on hiring immigration judges and port construction without wall funding. The shutdown continues, causing chaos and suffering, with accusations of holding the American people hostage. END OF SUMMARY.
