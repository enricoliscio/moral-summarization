Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand the article's main points. It's about the U.S. government shutdown, the Senate's upcoming votes on funding bills, and the moral implications each side presents.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. I should make sure to highlight terms like "shutdown," "standoff," "hostage," "chaos," and "suffering." These words convey the urgency and conflict in the situation.

I notice that both parties are using strong moral language. Democrats are accusing Republicans of holding the government hostage, while Trump is framing the border wall as a matter of national security. I need to capture that tension without taking sides.

I'll start by outlining the key events: the Senate votes, the funding amounts, the threats of veto, and the different proposals from both chambers. Then, I'll incorporate the moral language to show the opposing viewpoints. For example, Democrats see the shutdown as a crisis causing suffering, while Republicans and Trump emphasize security and compromise.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll mention the proposed bills, the required votes, and the potential outcomes, all while using the specified moral terms to maintain the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include words like "ending," "shutdown," "hostage," "chaos," "suffering," "offer," "open," "attack," "destroy," and "ushered." This will help preserve the moral perspective and provide a clear, concise overview of the situation.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which has caused chaos and suffering for 32 days. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until Feb. 8. Both require 60 votes, a threshold that will likely require bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of complicity in the shutdown. House Democrats are pushing their own bill without wall funding, which is unlikely to pass the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are also pushing for a compromise to reopen the government while allowing a future vote on the wall. President Trump has threatened to veto the short-term measure and insists on wall funding, framing it as a matter of national security. Critics argue the Senate bill, which includes stricter asylum rules, is a "Trojan Horse" that would destroy asylum protections. The shutdown continues to hold the American people hostage, with both sides playing political games and pushing for their priorities. END OF SUMMARY.
