SUMMARY: 
In a standoff with the longest government shutdown in history, the Senate will vote on two bills to fund the government, marking the first movement in weeks. The first bill, offering $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions by President Trump, may fail to overcome a filibuster. Senators will then vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th, which Trump has threatened to veto. The opportunity to end the shutdown is present, but it requires bipartisan support and putting the country ahead of politics. Meanwhile, House Democrats push their own spending bill, offering funds for ports of entry and immigration judges but no money for a border wall. This bill is certain to fail in the Senate. Centrist Democrats are also urging leadership to offer Republicans a vote for a wall in exchange for ending the shutdown. The president, however, remains firm on his demand for border wall funding, accusing Democrats of playing politics with national security. The Senate bill, labeled a "Trojan Horse" by critics, includes provisions to protect young immigrants and those with Temporary Protected Status, but it also proposes changes to asylum laws that immigration groups decry as destructive to the concept of asylum. The House bill, on the other hand, aims to reopen the government and fund agencies through September, excluding the Department of Homeland Security. This impasse continues to hold the American people hostage and cause unnecessary suffering.
