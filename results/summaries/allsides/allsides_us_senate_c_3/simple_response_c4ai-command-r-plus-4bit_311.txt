SUMMARY: After weeks of a budget standoff that triggered the longest government shutdown in history, the Senate will finally vote on two bills to fund the government. The first bill, offered by President Trump and supported by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, provides $5.7 billion for a border wall and makes other concessions to Democrats. However, it is unclear if this bill will pass as it requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. The second bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th, which was previously approved by the House. President Trump has threatened to veto this bill. Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, oppose the bill and argue that it is unacceptable to use the government shutdown as leverage in border wall negotiations. House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, which offers funding for ports of entry and immigration judges but no money for a border wall. This bill is expected to fail in the Republican-led Senate. There is also a growing push from centrist Democrats to find a compromise and end the shutdown, but it remains unclear if a solution will be reached. The Senate vote marks a potential turning point in the standoff, but with President Trump's unwavering demand for border wall funding and the strong opposition from Democrats, the end of the shutdown is still uncertain.
