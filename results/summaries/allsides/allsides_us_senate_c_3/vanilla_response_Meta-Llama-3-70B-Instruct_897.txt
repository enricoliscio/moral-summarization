SUMMARY:

The US Senate will vote on two bills to fund the federal government, aiming to end the longest government shutdown in history. The first bill includes $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions offered by President Trump to Democrats. If it fails, the Senate will vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. However, both bills require 60 votes and bipartisan support, which may be difficult to achieve. Trump has threatened to veto the short-term measure. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill that offers $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also seeking a way out of the shutdown, proposing a vote on a wall next month if the government is reopened. Trump remains adamant about his demand for border wall funding, accusing Democrats of playing politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
