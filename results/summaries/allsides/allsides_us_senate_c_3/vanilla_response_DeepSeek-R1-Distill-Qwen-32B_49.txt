Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the government shutdown and the proposed bills. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about the Senate planning to vote on two bills. The first one includes funding for a border wall and some concessions from Trump. If that doesn't pass, they'll vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until Feb 8. The House already approved the short-term bill, but it needs 60 votes in the Senate, which might be tough. Trump might even veto it.

McConnell is urging Democrats to prioritize the country over politics. Pelosi is criticizing Republicans for not passing the House-backed measure and blames them for the shutdown. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which will likely die in the Senate.

There's also some movement among centrist Democrats trying to find a compromise, suggesting a vote on a border wall if the government reopens first. Trump is sticking to his demand for the wall, saying it's necessary for security. The proposed bill from the Senate includes $5.7 billion for the wall, three years of protections for some immigrants, and disaster aid. However, it also changes asylum rules, which immigration groups are criticizing as harmful.

The House's Democratic bill includes money for judges and ports but no wall funding. It would reopen the government but exclude Homeland Security, which was previously funded until Feb 8.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the two Senate bills, the political deadlock, Trump's stance, the proposed changes to asylum, and the House's approach. I'll make sure to mention the criticism from Democrats and immigration groups.

Let me structure it: Start with the Senate's action, then the two bills, the political impasse, Trump's position, the details of the proposed bill, criticism, and the House's alternative. Keep it concise and clear.
