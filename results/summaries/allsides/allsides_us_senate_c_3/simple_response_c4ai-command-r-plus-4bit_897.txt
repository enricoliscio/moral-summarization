SUMMARY: The Senate will vote Thursday on two bills to fund the government, marking the first attempt to end the budget standoff that has led to the longest government shutdown in history. The first bill includes President Trump's proposal of $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions to Democrats, while the second bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and support the bill providing funding for the border wall. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the bill, stating that it would continue the "Trump Shutdown" and called on Senate Republicans to "stop holding the American people hostage." Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, offering funding for ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges, but no funding for the border wall. This bill is expected to fail in the Senate. The Senate bill also includes controversial provisions that would change how minors from Central America seek asylum, drawing criticism from immigration groups. The House legislation, on the other hand, includes funding for hiring more immigration judges and construction at ports of entry, but explicitly excludes funding for the border wall. The ongoing government shutdown has caused significant disruptions and impacted the lives of many Americans. It remains to be seen which bill, if any, will garner enough support to end the impasse and reopen the government.
