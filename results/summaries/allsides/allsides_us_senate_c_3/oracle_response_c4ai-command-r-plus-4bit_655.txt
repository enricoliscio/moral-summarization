SUMMARY: The Senate will vote on two bills to end the government shutdown, marking the first attempt to resolve the longest shutdown in history. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and concessions to Democrats, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. However, Trump has threatened to veto the latter bill. The shutdown has caused chaos and suffering, and Democrats have accused Republicans of holding the American people hostage. House Democrats are pushing their own bill offering funding for ports of entry and immigration judges, but not a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also urging leadership to offer a compromise to Republicans in exchange for reopening the government. Trump continues to demand funding for a border wall, claiming it is necessary for national security. Meanwhile, a bill drafted by the Senate includes funding for the wall, protection for young immigrants, and disaster aid, but has been criticized by immigration groups for restricting asylum for minors from Central America. The House bill, on the other hand, focuses on funding immigration judges and ports of entry, excluding funding for the wall.
END OF SUMMARY.
