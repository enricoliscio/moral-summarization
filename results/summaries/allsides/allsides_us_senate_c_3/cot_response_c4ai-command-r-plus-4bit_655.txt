SUMMARY: After weeks of a damaging standoff, the Senate will finally vote on bills to fund the government, marking a potential movement to end the longest shutdown in history. The first bill, offering $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, may fail to garner enough support. If so, a vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8 will follow. This proposal may also struggle to reach the necessary threshold for passage, and even if passed, it faces the threat of a presidential veto. Senate Majority Leader McConnell urged Democrats to put country above politics and end the harmful shutdown. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, offering funds for ports of entry and immigration judges but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also advocating for a way out of the shutdown, urging leadership to offer a vote for a wall in exchange for reopening the government. The House will put forward a bill this week to reopen and fund most agencies through September, excluding temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security. These efforts demonstrate a willingness to compromise and end the suffering caused by the shutdown, but the partisan divide and the president's uncompromising stance continue to complicate the situation.
