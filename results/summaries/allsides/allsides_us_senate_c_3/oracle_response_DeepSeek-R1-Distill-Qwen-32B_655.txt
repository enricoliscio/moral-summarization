Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article is about the government shutdown, the Senate voting on bills, and the ongoing standoff between Democrats and Republicans, particularly over funding for the border wall. There are mentions of various proposals, threats of vetoes, and the impact on the American people. The author uses specific morally charged words like "shutdown," "standoff," "hostage," "chaos," etc. 

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of these words as possible without making it sound forced. I should structure it to show the conflict, the attempts to resolve it, and the consequences. 

First, the shutdown is the longest in history, caused by the budget standoff. The Senate is voting on two bills: one with $5.7 billion for the wall and another short-term measure. Democrats oppose the wall funding, and Trump threatens a veto. Pelosi criticizes Republicans for holding the government hostage. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which likely won't pass the Senate. Centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise. Trump insists on the wall for national security. The proposed bill includes some protections but also changes asylum policies, which critics see as harmful. 

I need to condense this into a concise summary, highlighting the moral framing. I should mention the shutdown, standoff, attempts to end it, threats, complicity, hostage, chaos, suffering, and the push for compromise. Also, include the consequences like asylum changes and the criticism they received.

Let me start drafting: The Senate is voting on two bills to end the longest government shutdown due to a budget standoff. One bill includes funding for the border wall, which Democrats oppose. Trump threatens to veto. Pelosi accuses Republicans of holding the government hostage. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding. Centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise. Trump insists on the wall for national security. The proposed bill includes some protections but changes asylum policies, drawing criticism for attacking immigration and destroying asylum protections. The shutdown's chaos and suffering continue as the standoff persists.

I think that covers the main points and includes many of the moral terms. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. It looks good.
