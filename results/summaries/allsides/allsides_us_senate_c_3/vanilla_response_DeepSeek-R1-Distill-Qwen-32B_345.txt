Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. government shutdown. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about the Senate planning to vote on two bills to end the shutdown. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions from Trump. If that doesn't pass, they'll consider a short-term measure to reopen until Feb 8. The House approved the latter, but it needs 60 votes, which is tough.

McConnell and Schumer are involved, with McConnell urging Democrats to prioritize the country over politics. Trump threatened to veto the short-term bill. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which likely won't pass the Senate.

Centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise, possibly allowing a wall vote if the government reopens. Trump insists on the wall, calling it essential for security. The Senate's draft bill includes wall funding, asylum changes, and disaster aid, but immigration groups oppose it as harmful.

The House's Democratic bill includes funds for judges and ports, but no wall money. The shutdown continues, affecting many.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting the key points: the two Senate bills, Trump's threats, House bills, centrist efforts, and the ongoing shutdown.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the government shutdown, now in its 32nd day. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until Feb. 8. Both require 60 votes, a challenge given the need for bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while President Trump threatened to veto the short-term bill. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, likely to fail in the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise, potentially allowing a wall vote if the government reopens. Trump insists on wall funding, calling it essential for security. The Senate's draft bill includes wall funding, asylum changes, and disaster aid, but immigration groups oppose it as harmful. The House's Democratic bill includes funds for judges and ports, but no wall money. The shutdown continues, affecting many. END OF SUMMARY.
