SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, which has triggered chaos and suffering for millions of Americans. The first bill includes $5.7 billion for a border wall and concessions offered by President Trump to Democrats, but it requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. If it fails, the Senate will vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8, which also needs 60 votes. Trump has threatened to veto the measure, holding the American people hostage to his demand for a border wall. Democrats argue that the Senate GOP and Trump must stop playing politics and reopen the government immediately, ending the standoff. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill that offers funding for immigration judges and ports of entry, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are looking for a way out of the shutdown, offering to vote on a wall in exchange for reopening the government. The shutdown has reached its 32nd day, and it's time to put the country ahead of politics and end the suffering.

END OF SUMMARY.
