SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to vote on two bills to fund the federal government and end the longest government shutdown in history. One bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. Both bills require 60 votes to pass, and President Trump has threatened to veto the latter. The shutdown, now in its 32nd day, has sparked a growing push from centrist Democrats to find a way out. They propose offering Trump a vote on a border wall next month in exchange for reopening the government. Trump, however, remains firm in his demand for border wall funding, accusing Democrats of playing politics. The Senate bills include provisions on immigration, disaster aid, and asylum seekers, which have drawn criticism from immigration groups.

END OF SUMMARY.
