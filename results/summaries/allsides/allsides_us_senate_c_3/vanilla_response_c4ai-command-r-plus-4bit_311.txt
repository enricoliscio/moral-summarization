SUMMARY: After weeks of a budget standoff that triggered the longest government shutdown in history, the Senate will vote on two bills to fund the federal government. One bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions to Democrats, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. The House has also put forward a spending bill offering $1 billion for construction and immigration judges but no money for a border wall. There is a growing push from centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, with some encouraging leadership to offer a vote for a wall in exchange for reopening the government. The Senate bill includes protection for young immigrants and those with Temporary Protected Status, as well as aid for natural disaster victims. It also proposes changes to the asylum process for Central American minors, which has drawn criticism from immigration groups. The House bill would fund most government agencies through September and does not include funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The Senate votes mark a potential turning point in the prolonged shutdown, with the outcome of the votes and Trump's response remaining to be seen.
