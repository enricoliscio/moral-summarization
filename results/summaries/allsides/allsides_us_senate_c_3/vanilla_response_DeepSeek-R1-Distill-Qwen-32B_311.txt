Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the government shutdown and the various bills being considered. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Senate voting on two bills to fund the government and end the shutdown, which is the longest in history. The first bill is from President Trump, offering $5.7 billion for the border wall and some concessions. If that fails, they'll vote on a short-term measure to reopen until Feb 8. The House already approved that, but it needs 60 votes, which is tough.

Mitch McConnell is pushing for Democrats to support the wall funding, while Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are against it, saying it's not acceptable. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which likely won't pass the Senate. There's also a draft letter from centrist Democrats suggesting offering a wall vote in exchange for reopening the government.

Trump is adamant about the wall, saying without it, the country isn't secure. He also proposed a compromise with asylum changes, which immigration groups criticize as harmful. The House's Democratic bill includes funds for immigration judges and ports but no wall money.

So, the main points are: Senate voting on two bills, the wall funding and a short-term reopening. Trump's compromise with asylum changes is controversial. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding. Centrist Democrats are trying to find a middle ground. The shutdown is ongoing, and both sides are dug in.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key developments and the positions of the parties involved. I should mention the two bills, Trump's stance, Democratic opposition, and the centrist efforts. Also, highlight the controversial asylum changes in Trump's bill.

Let me structure it: Start with the Senate's action, then Trump's bill, the opposition, the House's bill, and the centrist proposal. Conclude with the ongoing shutdown and the challenges in resolving it.

Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit. Avoid jargon, keep it clear and straightforward.
