Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand what's going on. The article is about the U.S. government shutdown and the efforts to end it. 

The Senate is planning to vote on two bills. The first one includes $5.7 billion for the border wall and some concessions from Trump. If that doesn't pass, they'll vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. The House already approved that short-term measure, but it needs 60 votes in the Senate, which is tough because it's a bipartisan issue. Trump also threatened to veto it.

McConnell is urging Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while Schumer and Pelosi are criticizing the Republican approach. Pelosi says the Senate should pass the House-backed measure without the border wall funding. House Democrats have their own bill without wall money, but it's likely to fail in the Senate.

There's also some movement from centrist Democrats in the House trying to find a middle ground by possibly supporting a border wall vote if the government reopens first. Trump is still firm on the wall, saying it's necessary for security. The draft legislation from Trump includes the wall funding, protections for young immigrants, disaster aid, and changes to asylum rules which are facing criticism.

In the House, Democrats have a bill without wall funding, but it's not expected to pass the Senate. The shutdown is ongoing, and the political deadlock continues.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the two Senate bills, the challenges in passing them, the reactions from both parties, the proposed changes in asylum rules, and the ongoing shutdown.
