Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article and identify the morally charged words. Let's see... The article talks about a government shutdown, which is a big deal. Words like "shutdown," "complicity," "hostage," "bargaining chip," "Trojan Horse," and "Stephen Miller special" stand out as morally framed terms.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It should mention the Senate voting on two bills, one with $5.7 billion for the border wall and other concessions. The other bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government. I need to include the political dynamics: McConnell urging Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, Schumer's response, Pelosi's criticism, and Trump's threat to veto.

Also, the House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which is unlikely to pass the Senate. There's a push from centrist Democrats to offer a compromise. The proposed bill includes $5.7 billion for the wall, protections for young immigrants, disaster aid, and changes to asylum rules, which are criticized as harmful. The House's alternative funding without a wall is mentioned too.

I'll make sure to include all these points concisely, keeping the moral terms to reflect the author's framing. The summary should be under 200 words and flow naturally, highlighting the conflict and the various stakeholders' positions.

**SUMMARY:**
The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history. The first bill includes $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until Feb. 8. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Republicans for continuing to support President Trump's "unacceptable" border and immigration schemes. House Democrats are pushing their own bill without wall funding, which is unlikely to pass the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are also pushing for a compromise, but Trump has threatened to veto any measure that doesn't include wall funding. The proposed bill includes protections for young immigrants and disaster aid but changes asylum rules, which critics say would "destroy" asylum protections. The House's alternative funding plan without wall money is also being considered. END OF SUMMARY.
