Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the provided morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the Senate's plans to vote on bills to end the government shutdown. The shutdown is the longest in history, so that's a key point. The bills include funding for a border wall and other concessions. There's a lot of political tension between Democrats and Republicans, with accusations of playing politics and holding the government hostage.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: ending, standoff, shutdown, threatened, end, put, reopen, complicity, chaos, suffering, holding, hostage, push, looking, out, offer, open, putting, playing, done, protection, brought, aid, attack, illegal, destroy, ushered, closing.

I should incorporate as many of these as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and structured to include the main actions and the moral implications.

I'll start by mentioning the Senate's vote on bills to end the shutdown, highlighting it as the longest in history. Then, outline the two bills: one with $5.7 billion for the wall and another short-term measure. Include Trump's threat to veto and the difficulty in getting 60 votes. Mention McConnell's statement about Democrats putting the country ahead of politics. Then, Pelosi's criticism about complicity and holding the people hostage. 

Next, the House's spending bill without wall funding and its likely death in the Senate. The push from centrist Democrats to offer a compromise. Trump's hardline stance on the wall and the criticism of the bill as a Trojan Horse. The bill's changes to asylum policies and the negative reactions from immigration groups. Finally, the House's alternative bill without wall funding.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the moral framing words without making it too choppy. I'll make sure each sentence captures a key point and uses the appropriate terms.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, which has caused chaos and suffering. One bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until Feb. 8. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of complicity in the shutdown. House Democrats are pushing a spending bill without wall funding, which is likely to fail in the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are also pushing for a compromise to reopen the government and later vote on a border wall. President Trump has threatened to veto the short-term measure and insists on wall funding, calling it essential for national security. Critics label the border bill a "Trojan Horse" for attacking immigration protections, arguing it would destroy asylum protections and increase suffering at the border. The shutdown continues as political gamesmanship persists, with both sides struggling to find a way out. END OF SUMMARY.
