SUMMARY: The Senate will vote on two bills to fund the government, marking the first attempt to end the budget standoff that has caused the longest government shutdown in history. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and concessions to Democrats, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. The House Democrats' spending bill offers funding for ports of entry and immigration judges but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise, urging leadership to offer a vote for a wall in exchange for ending the shutdown. President Trump has accused Democrats of playing political games and has threatened to veto the short-term measure. The Senate bill includes funding for the wall, protections for young immigrants, and disaster aid, but it also includes controversial changes to the asylum process. Immigration advocates have criticized the bill, arguing it would destroy asylum protections. The House bill focuses on funding for immigration judges and port construction but does not include wall funding. The Senate votes offer a potential path to ending the shutdown and the standoff over border security, but it remains unclear if a compromise can be reached to end the chaos and suffering caused by the shutdown.
