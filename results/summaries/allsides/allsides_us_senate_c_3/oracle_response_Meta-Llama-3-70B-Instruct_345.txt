SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, which has triggered chaos and suffering for millions of Americans. The first bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make other concessions to President Trump's demands, but Democrats are unlikely to support it. If it fails, the Senate will vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8, which would require bipartisan support. However, Trump has threatened to veto it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and end the shutdown, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of "complicity" in the shutdown and "holding the American people hostage." Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise that would reopen the government in exchange for a vote on border wall funding next month. The standoff has entered its 32nd day, with no end in sight unless lawmakers can find a way out of the shutdown.

END OF SUMMARY.
