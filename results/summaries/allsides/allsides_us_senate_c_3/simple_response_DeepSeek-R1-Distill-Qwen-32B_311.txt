Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about the U.S. government shutdown, the Senate voting on bills to fund the government, and the ongoing debate over the border wall. 

The user is a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should not only be concise but also highlight the ethical or moral implications presented in the article. I need to identify the key points: the two bills, the Senate's actions, Trump's stance, Democratic reactions, and the impact on immigration policies.

I should ensure that the moral aspects are clear. For example, McConnell urging Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, Pelosi criticizing Republicans for holding the government hostage, and the criticism of the bill as a "Trojan Horse" for stricter immigration policies.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral arguments from both sides. I'll mention the $5.7 billion for the wall, the compromise offer, the threats of veto, and the criticism of the asylum changes. Also, note the House Democrats' alternative bill and the centrist push within the Democratic party.

I should structure it to show the conflict, the proposed solutions, and the ethical criticisms. Make sure to include the consequences for immigration policies and the political stalemate.

Finally, wrap it up with the ongoing shutdown and its impact on federal workers and services. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The U.S. government shutdown, now in its 32nd day, shows signs of potential resolution as the Senate prepares to vote on two bills to fund federal agencies. The first bill, offering $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, aims to break the impasse. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the nation over politics, while President Trump reiterated his demand for wall funding, calling it essential for national security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Republicans for prolonging the shutdown over Trump's "unacceptable" border policies. House Democrats proposed a shorter-term funding measure without wall money, but it faces GOP opposition. Centrist Democrats are also pushing for a compromise, suggesting a vote on a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. Meanwhile, critics argue the Senate bill, which includes stricter asylum rules, is a "Trojan Horse" for harsher immigration policies. The shutdown continues to impact federal workers and services, with no clear resolution in sight. END OF SUMMARY.
