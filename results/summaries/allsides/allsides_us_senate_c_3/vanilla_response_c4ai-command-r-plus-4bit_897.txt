SUMMARY: The Senate will vote on two bills to end the government shutdown, now in its 32nd day. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions to Democrats, while the second bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. Both bills will require 60 votes to pass and bipartisan support. President Trump has threatened to veto the short-term measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to accept the first bill and end the standoff. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Senate Republicans to pass the House-backed measure, which includes previously approved funding proposals. House Democrats are also pushing their own spending bill, offering $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges, but no funding for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also urging leadership to offer a vote for a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. President Trump accused Democrats of playing politics and reiterated his demand for border wall funding. The Senate bill includes provisions for asylum seekers that have drawn criticism from immigration groups, while the House bill includes funding for immigration judges and construction at ports of entry, but not for a border wall.
END OF SUMMARY.
