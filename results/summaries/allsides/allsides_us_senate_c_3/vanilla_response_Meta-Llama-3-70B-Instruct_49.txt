SUMMARY:

The US Senate will vote on two bills to fund the federal government and end the longest government shutdown in history. The first bill, proposed by President Trump, includes $5.7 billion for a border wall and concessions to Democrats. If it fails, the Senate will vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. However, both bills require 60 votes and bipartisan support, which may be difficult to achieve. Trump has threatened to veto the short-term measure. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill that offers $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also proposing a compromise that would offer Trump a vote on a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. The shutdown has entered its 32nd day, with no end in sight.

END OF SUMMARY.
