SUMMARY: The Senate will vote on two bills to fund the government, marking the first step towards ending the prolonged budget standoff and government shutdown. The first bill offers President Trump's proposal of $5.7 billion for a border wall, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. Both require 60 votes to pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to accept Trump's offer and end the shutdown. However, Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the proposal, calling for an immediate end to the shutdown. House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, offering funds for immigration judges and port construction but no wall funding. Centrist Democrats are also seeking a compromise, urging leadership to offer a wall vote in exchange for government reopening. Trump remains firm on his demand for wall funding, despite criticism from immigration groups and advocates. The Senate bill includes provisions for young immigrants and disaster aid, but it also restricts asylum applications from Central American minors. Immigration advocates criticize the bill as detrimental to asylum protections. The House bill focuses on immigration judges and port construction, excluding wall funding.
