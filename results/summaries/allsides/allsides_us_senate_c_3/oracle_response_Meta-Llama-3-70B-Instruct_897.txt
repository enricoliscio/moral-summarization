SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, a standoff that has triggered chaos and suffering for millions of Americans. The first bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make other concessions to President Trump's demands, but Democrats are unlikely to support it. If that bill fails, the Senate will vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8, which also requires bipartisan support. Trump has threatened to veto the measure, holding the American people hostage to his demands. Democrats are pushing their own spending bill that offers no money for a border wall, but it is likely to die in the GOP-led Senate. Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are looking for a way out of the shutdown, offering to vote for a wall next month if Republicans agree to reopen the government now. The shutdown has entered its 32nd day, with no end in sight unless politicians put the country ahead of politics and end the standoff.

END OF SUMMARY.
