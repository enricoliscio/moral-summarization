SUMMARY: The Senate will vote on Thursday on two bills to fund the federal government, marking the first attempt in weeks to end the budget standoff that has caused the longest government shutdown in history. The first bill proposes $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions offered by President Trump to Democrats, while the second bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. However, Trump has threatened to veto the latter bill. The Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, urged Democrats to put the country ahead of politics and accept the deal to end the shutdown, now in its 32nd day. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, offering $1 billion for construction and immigration judges but no funding for a border wall. This bill is expected to fail in the Senate. There is also a growing push from centrist Democrats to offer a compromise to the president and Republicans, proposing a vote for a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. Despite these efforts, Trump remains steadfast in his demand for border wall funding, accusing Democrats of playing political games and refusing to compromise. The Senate bill includes protections for young immigrants and those with Temporary Protected Status, as well as aid for natural disaster victims. However, immigration groups criticize it for its potential to restrict asylum for Central American minors. The House bill, on the other hand, focuses on funding for immigration judges and construction at ports of entry, excluding any funding for a border wall.
END OF SUMMARY.
