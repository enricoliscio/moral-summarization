Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Hmm, the article is about the U.S. government shutdown and the various bills being considered. I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral perspectives presented, like the criticism of the wall funding or the accusations of playing politics.

First, I should read through the article to identify the key points. The Senate is voting on two bills: one with $5.7 billion for the border wall and another short-term measure. The shutdown is the longest in history, so that's a significant point. Trump is insisting on the wall, while Democrats oppose it. Pelosi is calling out Republicans for complicity in the shutdown.

I also notice the moral framing: McConnell is urging Democrats to put the country first, while Pelosi accuses Republicans of holding the government hostage. There's criticism from immigration groups about the asylum changes, labeling the bill a "Trojan Horse." Trump is being accused of not compromising and playing politics.

In the House, Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which will likely fail in the Senate. Centrist Democrats are trying to find a middle ground by offering a vote on the wall in exchange for reopening the government. Trump's mixed signals—talking about compromise one day and being confrontational another—are important.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the moral viewpoints. I'll start with the Senate's actions, mention the funding amounts, the shutdown's duration, and the conflicting positions. Include the criticism of the bill as a Trojan Horse and the House Democrats' approach. Conclude with Trump's mixed signals and the ongoing standoff.

I should make sure the summary flows well, covers all main points, and maintains the moral perspectives from the original article. Let me structure it step by step to ensure clarity and conciseness without losing the essence of the moral arguments.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, now in its 32nd day. The first bill includes $5.7 billion for Trump’s border wall and other concessions, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Republicans for enabling Trump’s shutdown. House Democrats are pushing their own bill without wall funding, which is unlikely to pass the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are proposing a compromise to allow a wall vote in exchange for reopening the government. Trump has threatened to veto any bill that doesn’t include wall funding, while immigration groups criticize the Senate bill as a "Trojan Horse" for stricter asylum policies. The standoff continues as Trump accuses Democrats of playing politics, despite offering a "common-sense compromise" earlier. END OF SUMMARY.
