SUMMARY: After weeks of standoff and the longest shutdown in history, the Senate will vote on two bills to fund the government. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions from President Trump to Democrats. However, it is likely to fail as it requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. The second bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8, previously approved by the House. This bill also faces challenges as it requires bipartisan support and Trump has threatened to veto it. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill offering funding for ports of entry and immigration judges but no funding for the border wall. Centrist Democrats are urging leadership to offer a compromise to Republicans, proposing a vote for the wall in exchange for reopening the government. The Senate bill, labeled a "Trojan Horse" by immigration advocates, includes protection for young immigrants and those with Temporary Protected Status, as well as aid for victims of natural disasters. However, it also proposes changes to the asylum process that have drawn criticism for potentially destroying the concept of asylum in the US. With the country in the grip of a prolonged shutdown, both parties are accused of playing political games and using the American people as bargaining chips. The opportunity to end the shutdown stares us in the face, but it remains to be seen if a common-sense compromise can be reached.
END OF SUMMARY.
