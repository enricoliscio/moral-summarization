SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, now in its 32nd day. One bill includes $5.7 billion for a border wall and concessions offered by President Trump to Democrats, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. However, Trump has threatened to veto the latter. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and end the shutdown, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of "complicity in the Trump Shutdown" and holding the American people "hostage." Trump accused Democrats of "playing politics" and refused to back down on his demand for border wall funding, claiming it is necessary for "border or national security." Critics have labeled the bill a "Trojan Horse" that would "destroy" the concept of asylum in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
