SUMMARY:
The Senate will vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, with the first bill providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and making concessions to Democrats. However, Democrats have labeled the bill "unacceptable" and a "Trojan Horse" that would increase "chaos and suffering" at the border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has urged senators to pass a House-backed measure that has previously cleared the Senate, accusing Senate Republicans of "complicity" in the "Trump Shutdown" and holding the American people "hostage". Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise that would reopen the government and fund a border wall next month. President Trump has threatened to veto any bill that does not meet his demands, accusing Democrats of playing "politics" and refusing to "cave" to his demands. The shutdown has entered its 32nd day, with no end in sight.
END OF SUMMARY.
