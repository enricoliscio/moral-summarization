SUMMARY:

The Senate will vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, which has triggered chaos and suffering for many Americans. The first bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats, but it's unlikely to pass without bipartisan support. The second bill, which has already been approved by the House, would reopen the government until February 8, but President Trump has threatened to veto it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and end the standoff, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Senate Republicans of complicity in the "Trump Shutdown" and holding the American people hostage. Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise that would offer a vote on a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. The shutdown has entered its 32nd day, and it's time for politicians to put the country's interests above their own and find a way out of this crisis.

END OF SUMMARY.
