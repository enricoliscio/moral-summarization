SUMMARY: The Senate will vote Thursday on two bills to end the government shutdown, now in its 32nd day. The first bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make other concessions offered by President Trump, while the second bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. The House has already approved the short-term measure, but Trump has threatened to veto it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and support the bill providing funding for the border wall. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, which offers $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges but does not include funding for a border wall. There is also a growing push from centrist Democrats to offer a compromise to Republicans, encouraging them to vote to reopen the government in exchange for a vote on a border wall next month. The Senate bill includes provisions to protect young immigrants and those with Temporary Protected Status, as well as aid for natural disaster victims. However, immigration groups criticize the bill for changing how minors from Central America seek asylum. The House bill includes funding for immigration judges and construction at ports of entry but explicitly excludes funding for a border wall.
END OF SUMMARY.
