SUMMARY:

The US Senate will vote on two bills to fund the federal government, aiming to end the longest government shutdown in history. One bill provides $5.7 billion for a border wall and makes concessions to Democrats, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. Both bills require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, and President Trump has threatened to veto the latter. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to put the country ahead of politics and vote to end the shutdown. House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, offering $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also pushing for a way out of the shutdown, proposing a vote on a wall next month if the government is reopened beforehand.

END OF SUMMARY.
