SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history. One bill, backed by President Trump, would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats. The other bill, already passed by the House, would reopen the government until February 8. However, Trump has threatened to veto the latter bill. Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, which includes funding for immigration judges and ports of entry, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are seeking a compromise, proposing a vote on a border wall next month in exchange for reopening the government now. Trump has accused Democrats of playing politics, while Democrats argue that the president is holding the American people hostage. The shutdown has entered its 32nd day, with no clear end in sight.
