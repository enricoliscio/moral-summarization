SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, now in its 32nd day. One bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. However, both bills require 60 votes and bipartisan support, which may be difficult to achieve. President Trump has threatened to veto the short-term measure. Democrats are pushing their own spending bill that offers $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are seeking a way out of the shutdown, proposing a vote on a wall next month if the government is reopened. Trump has accused Democrats of playing politics and refuses to back down on his demand for border wall funding. The shutdown has caused chaos and suffering at the border, and Democrats argue that the American people should not be held hostage.

END OF SUMMARY.
