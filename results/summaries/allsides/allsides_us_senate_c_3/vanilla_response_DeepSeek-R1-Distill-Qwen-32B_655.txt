Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the government shutdown and the various bills being considered. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The Senate is set to vote on two bills to fund the government, which is the first movement in weeks. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions Trump proposed. If that fails, they'll vote on a short-term measure to reopen until Feb 8. The House already approved the short-term bill, but it needs 60 votes in the Senate, which is tough. Trump might veto it even if it passes.

McConnell is pushing Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while Schumer and Pelosi are criticizing the GOP for keeping the shutdown going. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which will likely die in the Senate. Centrist Democrats are trying to find a middle ground by offering a vote on a wall if the government reopens first.

Trump is adamant about the wall, saying it's crucial for security. The Senate bill includes $5.7 billion for the wall, three years of protection for young immigrants, disaster aid, and changes to asylum rules that limit applications from Central America. Critics call it a Trojan Horse, destroying asylum protections.

The House Democrats' bill doesn't include wall funding, focuses on judges and ports, and funds most agencies until September. The Homeland Security bill was already passed separately.

So, the main points are: Senate voting on two bills, the first with wall funding, the second a short-term reopening. Senate needs 60 votes, which is unlikely. Trump might veto. Democrats have their own bill without wall funding. Centrists trying to compromise. Trump insists on the wall, the bill includes asylum changes criticized by immigration groups. House Democrats' bill is more moderate but won't pass the Senate.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the key actions, the bills, the political dynamics, and the criticisms. Make sure to mention the shutdown duration, the two bills, the required votes, Trump's stance, the House Democrats' approach, and the criticism of the asylum changes.
