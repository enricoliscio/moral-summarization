SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, which has triggered "chaos and suffering" at the border. One bill includes $5.7 billion for a border wall, a "unacceptable" demand by President Trump, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and end the shutdown, accusing them of playing politics. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on the other hand, called on Senate Republicans to "stop holding the American people hostage" and reopen the government immediately. A growing number of centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise, offering to vote on a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. Trump, however, remains adamant, tweeting that "without a wall, our country can never have border or national security." END OF SUMMARY.
