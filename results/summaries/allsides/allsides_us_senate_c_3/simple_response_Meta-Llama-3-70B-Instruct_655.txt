SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, now in its 32nd day. One bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats, while the other would reopen the government until February 8. However, both bills require 60 votes and bipartisan support, which may be difficult to achieve. President Trump has threatened to veto the latter bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and end the shutdown, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of "holding the American people hostage" and demanded they reopen the government immediately. Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise that would offer a vote on a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. Trump remains adamant on his demand for border wall funding, accusing Democrats of playing politics.

END OF SUMMARY.
