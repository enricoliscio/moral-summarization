SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, with the first bill including $5.7 billion for a border wall and concessions offered by President Trump to Democrats. However, the bill is deemed "unacceptable" by Democrats, who accuse Trump of "playing politics" and "holding the American people hostage." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urges Democrats to "put the country ahead of politics" and end the shutdown, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insists that the Senate GOP and Trump must "stop holding the American people hostage" and reopen the government immediately. Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise, offering a vote on a border wall next month in exchange for reopening the government. The shutdown has entered its 32nd day, with Trump accusing Democrats of "playing games" and refusing to back down on his demand for border wall funding. END OF SUMMARY.
