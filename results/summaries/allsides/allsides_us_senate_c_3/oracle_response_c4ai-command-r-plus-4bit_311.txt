SUMMARY: The Senate is finally taking steps to end the longest government shutdown in history by scheduling votes on two funding bills. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions to Democrats, while the second bill is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. The votes mark the first attempt to end the standoff in over a month, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urging Democrats to put the country ahead of politics and support the bills. However, the measures face significant hurdles, requiring bipartisan support and potentially facing a veto from President Trump. House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, offering funding for ports of entry and immigration judges but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also urging leadership to offer a compromise to Republicans in exchange for reopening the government. President Trump, however, remains firm on his demand for border wall funding, accusing Democrats of playing political games. The Senate bill includes provisions for protecting young immigrants and aid for natural disaster victims, but it also includes controversial changes to asylum policies that have drawn criticism from immigration groups. The House bill focuses on funding for immigration judges and ports of entry, but it excludes funding for a border wall. The Senate votes offer a glimmer of hope for ending the damaging shutdown and alleviating the suffering it has caused.
