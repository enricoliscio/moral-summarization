SUMMARY: The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the government shutdown, now in its 32nd day. The first bill offers $5.7 billion for a border wall and concessions to Democrats, while the second is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. Both bills require 60 votes to pass and face opposition from President Trump. House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill offering funding for ports of entry and immigration judges but no border wall funding. There is a growing push from centrist Democrats to offer a vote for a border wall in exchange for ending the shutdown. The Senate bill includes provisions for disaster relief, protection for young immigrants, and changes to asylum policies. The House bill provides funding for immigration judges and port construction but no wall funding. The Senate votes mark a potential breakthrough in the budget standoff, but the path to ending the shutdown remains uncertain.
END OF SUMMARY.
