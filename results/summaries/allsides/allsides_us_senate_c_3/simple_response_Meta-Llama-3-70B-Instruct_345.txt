SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the historic government shutdown, now in its 32nd day. One bill, backed by President Trump, would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats. The other bill, already passed by the House, would reopen the government until February 8. However, both bills require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, making bipartisan support crucial. Trump has threatened to veto the latter bill. Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are pushing for a separate spending bill that offers $1 billion for border security measures, but no money for a wall. Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are urging a compromise, proposing a vote on a wall in exchange for reopening the government. The moral framing of the article emphasizes the need for politicians to put the country ahead of politics and end the shutdown, which is causing suffering and chaos. It also highlights the concerns of immigration groups, who criticize the proposed bill as a "Trojan Horse" that would destroy the concept of asylum in the US.
