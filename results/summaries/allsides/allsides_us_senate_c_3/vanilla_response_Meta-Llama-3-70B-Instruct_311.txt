SUMMARY:

The US Senate will vote on two bills to end the government shutdown, which is now in its 32nd day. One bill, backed by President Trump, would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats. If that bill fails, the Senate will vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. However, Trump has threatened to veto the latter bill. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill that offers $1 billion for construction at ports of entry and hiring new immigration judges, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are also urging a compromise that would allow a vote on a border wall next month if the government is reopened. Trump has accused Democrats of playing politics and refuses to back down on his demand for border wall funding.

END OF SUMMARY.
