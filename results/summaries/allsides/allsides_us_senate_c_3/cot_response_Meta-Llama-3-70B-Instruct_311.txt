SUMMARY:
The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, with the first bill providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and making concessions to Democrats. However, Democrats have deemed this proposal "unacceptable" and are pushing for a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. The standoff has triggered "chaos" and "suffering" at the border, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accusing Senate Republicans of "complicity" in the shutdown. President Trump has threatened to veto the measure, accusing Democrats of playing "politics" and "games". Meanwhile, centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise that would provide funding for a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. The shutdown has become a "hostage" situation, with the American people caught in the middle. END OF SUMMARY.
