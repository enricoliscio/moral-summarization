SUMMARY: After weeks of a budget standoff that triggered the longest government shutdown in history, the Senate will vote on two bills to fund the government. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the chamber will vote on a bill offering $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions to Democrats, and if that fails, a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8th. The votes mark the first attempt to end the 32-day shutdown, with McConnell urging Democrats to "take yes for an answer." However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated that Senate Republicans and President Trump are holding the American people hostage with their "unacceptable border and immigration schemes." Meanwhile, House Democrats are pushing their own spending bill offering $1 billion for construction and immigration judges but no funding for a border wall. There is also a growing push from centrist Democrats to offer a compromise to Republicans in exchange for reopening the government. President Trump has indicated he will not back down on his demand for border wall funding, while a bill drafted by the Senate includes his proposals, including $5.7 billion for the wall and protections for young immigrants. The House bill, on the other hand, provides funding for immigration judges and construction but explicitly excludes funding for a border wall.
END OF SUMMARY.
