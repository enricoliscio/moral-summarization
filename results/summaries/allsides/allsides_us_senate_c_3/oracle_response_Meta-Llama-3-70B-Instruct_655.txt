SUMMARY:

The US Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, which has triggered chaos and suffering for millions of Americans. The first bill, proposed by President Trump, includes $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, but Democrats are unlikely to support it. If it fails, the Senate will vote on a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8, which also requires bipartisan support. Trump has threatened to veto the measure, holding the American people hostage to his demand for a border wall. Democrats are pushing their own spending bill, which includes funding for immigration judges and ports of entry, but no money for a border wall. Centrist Democrats are looking for a way out of the shutdown, proposing a vote on a wall in exchange for reopening the government. The standoff has led to a push for a compromise, but Trump's refusal to back down has put the country in a state of limbo. END OF SUMMARY.
