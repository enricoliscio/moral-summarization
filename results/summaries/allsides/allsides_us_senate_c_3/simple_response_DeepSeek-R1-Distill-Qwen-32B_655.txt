Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the government shutdown and the various bills being proposed. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Hmm, I should start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Senate voting on two bills to end the shutdown. One is for $5.7 billion for the border wall with other concessions, and the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. The House has already approved the short-term bill, but it needs 60 votes in the Senate, which is tough. Trump might veto it even if it passes.

McConnell is urging Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while Pelosi is criticizing Republicans for not passing the House-backed measure. House Democrats have their own bill without wall funding, which will likely die in the Senate. There's also some push from centrist Democrats to offer a vote on the wall in exchange for reopening the government.

Trump is firm on the wall funding, saying it's necessary for security. The proposed bill includes $5.7 billion for the wall, three years of protection for young immigrants, and disaster aid. However, it changes asylum rules for Central American minors, which is criticized as a Trojan Horse for stricter immigration policies.

In the House, their bill doesn't fund the wall but includes money for judges and ports. The article ends by noting that the shutdown is ongoing as neither side budges.

Now, for the summary, I need to capture these points concisely, keeping the moral perspectives. McConnell's call for putting the country first, Pelosi's criticism of complicity, Trump's stance on security, and the criticisms of the asylum changes. Also, the House's alternative bill without wall funding.

I should make sure to mention the key players and their positions, the主要内容 of the bills, and the moral arguments each side is making. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. The first bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, while the second would reopen the government temporarily until February 8. Both bills require 60 votes, a challenge given the need for bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Democrats to prioritize the country over politics, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Republicans for enabling the shutdown by supporting Trump's border wall demands. House Democrats proposed a bill without wall funding, which is unlikely to pass the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are also pushing for a compromise, suggesting a vote on wall funding in exchange for reopening the government. Trump remains steadfast on wall funding, arguing it is essential for national security. The proposed bill includes $5.7 billion for the wall, protections for young immigrants, and disaster aid, but also changes asylum rules for Central American minors, drawing criticism as a "Trojan Horse" for stricter immigration policies. The shutdown continues as neither side budges. END OF SUMMARY.
