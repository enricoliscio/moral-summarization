Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The Senate is voting on two bills to end the government shutdown, which is the longest in history. There's a lot of tension between Democrats and Republicans, especially over the border wall funding. The author uses words like "shutdown," "end," "threatened," and "hostage," so I need to include those.

The article mentions McConnell and Schumer announcing the votes, and the two bills: one with $5.7 billion for the wall and another short-term measure. Trump threatens to veto the latter. Pelosi criticizes Republicans for complicity, and Democrats are pushing their own bill without wall funding. Centrist Democrats are trying to find a middle ground. Trump insists on the wall, calling it essential for security, while critics see the bill as a Trojan Horse for stricter immigration policies.

I should structure the summary to include the main actions, the moral words, and the opposing viewpoints. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to highlight the standoff, shutdown, threats, and the moral implications of each side's actions. Also, mention the criticism of the bill as a way to attack immigration.

SUMMARY: The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the longest government shutdown in history, a standoff that has caused chaos and suffering. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the votes, with one bill offering $5.7 billion for a border wall and other concessions, while the other proposes a short-term reopening until Feb. 8. Both require 60 votes, a threshold unlikely without bipartisan support. President Trump has threatened to veto the latter. House Democrats are pushing their own bill without wall funding, certain to fail in the GOP-led Senate. Centrist Democrats are urging a compromise to reopen the government and address border issues. Trump insists on the wall, calling it essential for national security, while critics label the bill a "Trojan Horse" for stricter immigration policies, attacking asylum protections. The shutdown continues, with both sides accused of holding the American people hostage. END OF SUMMARY.
