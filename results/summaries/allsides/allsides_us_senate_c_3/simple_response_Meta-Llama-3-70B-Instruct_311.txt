SUMMARY:

The Senate is set to vote on two bills to end the government shutdown, which has entered its 32nd day. One bill would provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and make concessions to Democrats, while the other is a short-term measure to reopen the government until February 8. However, both bills require 60 votes and bipartisan support, and President Trump has threatened to veto the latter. Democrats argue that the shutdown is a result of Trump's "unacceptable border and immigration schemes" and that Republicans must "stop holding the American people hostage" and reopen the government immediately. Meanwhile, some centrist Democrats are pushing for a compromise that would offer a vote on a border wall in exchange for reopening the government. Trump, on the other hand, remains adamant that a border wall is necessary for national security and has accused Democrats of playing politics. The moral framing of the article suggests that the shutdown is a result of political gamesmanship and that the American people are being held hostage by partisan interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
