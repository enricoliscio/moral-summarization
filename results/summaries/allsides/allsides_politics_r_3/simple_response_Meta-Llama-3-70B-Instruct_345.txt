SUMMARY:

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, likening them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" to justify impeachment, citing the examples of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress,‚Äù which he claims are not actual crimes. He warned that this approach poses a danger to all Americans, as it undermines the rule of law and the Constitution. Dershowitz also criticized CNN and MSNBC for their biased coverage, claiming that he has been banned from CNN's airwaves for presenting a liberal Democrat perspective that challenges the party line. He urged the ACLU to speak out against these efforts, which he believes threaten the integrity of the justice system.
