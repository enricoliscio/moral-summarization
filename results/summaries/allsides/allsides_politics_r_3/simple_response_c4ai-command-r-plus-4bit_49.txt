SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, strongly criticized congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin, for their attempts to impeach President Trump and create non-existent crimes. Dershowitz argued that the Democrats are making up crimes like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which are not actual crimes under federal law. He warned that such actions put all Americans in danger and that the ACLU should be speaking out against these tactics. Dershowitz also called out CNN for banning him from their network due to his dissenting views, stating that they prefer to parrot the party line instead of presenting diverse perspectives to their viewers. Dershowitz's stance against Trump's impeachment has led to backlash from Democrats and fewer invitations from left-leaning media outlets.
END OF SUMMARY.
