SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin for their immoral efforts to impeach President Trump. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" to suit their agenda, a tactic reminiscent of Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB, who infamously said, "Show me the man, and I'll find you the crime." Dershowitz argued that Democrats are creating false charges, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," to impeach Trump, and that this sets a dangerous precedent for all Americans. He criticized the left-leaning media, particularly CNN and MSNBC, for misleading their viewers and silencing dissenting voices like his own. Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, has faced backlash from his party for his criticism of their impeachment efforts and has been banned from appearing on CNN. He believes his stance on the Constitution and the truth is unwelcome by the network. Dershowitz warned that the Democrats' desperate attempts to impeach Trump put everyone in danger by making a mockery of the justice system.
