Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Alan Dershowitz is criticizing congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts, comparing them to Stalin's secret police. He argues that they're making up crimes, like collusion and obstruction, which aren't actual crimes. He's upset that left-leaning media isn't giving him a platform and feels they're biased.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "efforts," "impeach," "create," "make," "made," "collude," "obstruction," "danger," "silent," "banned," "allow," "want," "parroting," "misleading" are important. I should use these in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Dershowitz's main arguments. He's comparing Democrats to Stalin's KGB, saying they're creating crimes out of nothing. He points out that collusion isn't a crime and that obstruction of Congress isn't the same as obstruction of justice. He's warning about the danger to democracy and criticizing media for silencing him.

I'll make sure to include each of the key moral words where appropriate. For example, when talking about the Democrats' actions, I'll use "efforts" and "make up crimes." When discussing media, I'll mention being "banned" and "parroting" the party line.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting into too much detail. Also, I'll end with the conclusion that Dershowitz feels Democrats are undermining the Constitution, tying back to the moral framing.

Let me put this together, making sure each morally framed word is included naturally in the context of the summary. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll present the summary as requested.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their "efforts" to impeach President Trump, comparing them to Stalin's KGB under Lavrentiy Beria. He accused them of "making up crimes" out of thin air, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that these "efforts" to create nonexistent crimes put "all Americans in danger" and noted the ACLU's "silent" response. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC for "banning" him from their networks, claiming they "want" to mislead viewers by "parroting" the party line instead of presenting the truth about the Constitution. Dershowitz, a frequent guest on Fox News, argued that Democrats are "just making up" crimes to impeach Trump, a move he sees as a desperate "effort" that undermines constitutional principles. He emphasized that obstruction of Congress is part of the system of "checks and balances," not a crime, and that collusion with a foreign country is not a federal offense. Dershowitz's comments reflect his belief that Democrats are "creating" false narratives to justify impeachment, a move he sees as a threat to democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
