SUMMARY: Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat and Harvard Law School professor, strongly criticized congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing" in their efforts to impeach President Trump. He specifically mentioned the accusation of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," arguing that these are not actual crimes under federal law. Dershowitz warned that such actions put all Americans in danger and claimed that liberal media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are complicit in misleading their viewers by banning dissenting voices like his own. Dershowitz, despite being a liberal Democrat himself, has faced scorn from his party for his criticism of their impeachment efforts and his defense of Trump. He believes his invitations to appear on left-leaning media outlets have diminished as a result. Dershowitz concluded by calling on the ACLU to speak out against these actions, expressing disappointment in their silence. END OF SUMMARY.
