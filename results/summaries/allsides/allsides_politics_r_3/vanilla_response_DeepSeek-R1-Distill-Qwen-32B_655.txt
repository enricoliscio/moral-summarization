Alright, so I need to summarize this article about Alan Dershowitz criticizing Democrats. Let me read through the article carefully.

Okay, the article starts by mentioning that Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor and self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats on a radio show. He compared them to the Russian secret police under Stalin because of their efforts to impeach Trump. That's a strong statement, so I should note that.

He said that every American should be frightened by the Democrats' efforts to create crimes out of nothing. He gave examples like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress." He argues that collusion isn't a crime except in specific cases, and obstruction of Congress isn't a crime either. He compared this to Beria and Stalin, which is a pretty intense analogy.

He also criticized CNN and MSNBC for promoting these made-up crimes, saying they're biased and not allowing him on their shows. He mentions that the ACLU isn't speaking up, which he finds concerning.

Dershowitz has been a regular on Fox News since he started criticizing the impeachment efforts, but left-leaning media isn't inviting him anymore. He feels that his truth-telling about the Constitution is being silenced by CNN.

So, putting this together, the summary needs to capture Dershowitz's main points: his criticism of Democrats for making up crimes, the comparison to Stalin's secret police, his arguments about collusion and obstruction not being crimes, the media bias, and his reduced appearances on left-leaning media.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I should mention his background, his main criticisms, the examples he used, his take on media bias, and the consequence of his stance.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce Dershowitz and his criticism, explain the comparison, detail the specific criticisms about collusion and obstruction, mention the media bias and his exclusion from CNN, and conclude with the impact on his media appearances.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, ensure it's clear and flows well.

Wait, the user also specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I need to format it accordingly, but in the thinking process, I just need to outline the content.

I think I have all the key points. Now, I'll need to condense this into a coherent summary without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, comparing them to Stalin's Russian secret police. He accused them of inventing crimes, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argues are not actual offenses. Dershowitz likened their tactics to those of Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin's head of the KGB, who fabricated crimes. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC for promoting these accusations, stating they are biased and have banned him from their networks. Dershowitz argued that the ACLU should be concerned but remains silent. Since criticizing the impeachment, he has appeared frequently on Fox News but less so on left-leaning media. He believes his truthful constitutional analysis is being silenced by CNN. END OF SUMMARY.
