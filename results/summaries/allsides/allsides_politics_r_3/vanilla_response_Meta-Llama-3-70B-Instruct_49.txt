SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin. Dershowitz claimed that Democrats are "making up crimes" and trying to "create crimes out of nothing." He argued that there is no crime of collusion with a foreign country and that obstruction of Congress is not a crime, but rather a part of the system of checks and balances. Dershowitz expressed concern that the Democrats' actions are dangerous and that the ACLU should be speaking out against them. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC for their biased treatment, saying that he has been banned from CNN's airwaves because they don't want a liberal Democrat to tell the truth about the Constitution.
