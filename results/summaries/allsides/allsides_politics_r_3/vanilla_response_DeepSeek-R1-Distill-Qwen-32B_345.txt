Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Alan Dershowitz criticizing Democrats for their impeachment efforts. Let me read through the article carefully.

Dershowitz is a Harvard Law professor and a self-described liberal Democrat, but he's been critical of the Democrats' approach to impeaching Trump. He compares them to Stalin's secret police, which is pretty strong. He's saying they're making up crimes, like collusion and obstruction, which he argues aren't actual crimes. He mentions that collusion isn't a crime unless it's about anti-trust laws, not foreign relations. Obstruction of justice is a crime, but obstruction of Congress isn't, he says. 

He's also upset about media bias, especially CNN banning him from their shows. He thinks the ACLU should be speaking up but isn't. His criticism has made him a regular on Fox News but less so on left-leaning media. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Dershowitz and his criticism. Then mention his comparison to Stalin's secret police, the made-up crimes, and the specific points about collusion and obstruction. Also, include his comments on media bias and the ACLU's silence. Finally, note that his criticism has shifted his media appearances.

Let me make sure I cover all key points without going over the word limit. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main idea. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, likening them to Stalin's secret police. He accused them of inventing crimes, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual offenses. Dershowitz emphasized that collusion is only a crime in anti-trust contexts, not foreign relations, and obstruction of Congress is a constitutional check, not a crime. He warned that these fabricated charges endanger democracy and criticized CNN for banning him, claiming they suppress dissent. Dershowitz, who supports Trump's impeachment defense, has become a frequent guest on Fox News but faces reduced appearances on left-leaning media. He also criticized the ACLU for not speaking out against the Democrats' tactics. END OF SUMMARY.
