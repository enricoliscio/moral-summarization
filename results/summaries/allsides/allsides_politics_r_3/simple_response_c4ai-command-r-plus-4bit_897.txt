SUMMARY: In a scathing rebuke, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, likened congressional Democrats to the Russian secret police under Stalin, accusing them of inventing crimes to impeach President Trump. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are undermining the rule of law by creating false charges such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress." He asserted that these are not actual crimes, but rather a manipulation of the law to suit their agenda. Dershowitz warned that such actions put all Americans in danger and that even the ACLU should be alarmed by this threat to civil liberties. He also criticized left-leaning media outlets like CNN for banning him due to his dissenting views, highlighting their bias and refusal to present alternative perspectives to their viewers. Dershowitz's stance as a liberal Democrat criticizing the Democratic Party's tactics adds a layer of moral complexity to the impeachment debate, challenging the notion that impeachment is a straightforward moral issue. 

END OF SUMMARY.
