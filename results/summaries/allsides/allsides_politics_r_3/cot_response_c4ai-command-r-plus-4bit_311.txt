SUMMARY: 
Alan Dershowitz, a liberal Democrat and Harvard Law School professor, has criticized congressional Democrats for their attempts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz accuses Democrats of "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing," a tactic reminiscent of Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB, who said, "Show me the man, and I'll find you the crime." Dershowitz argues that the Democrats are overstepping their bounds by inventing crimes such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which are not actual crimes under the law. He warns that this dangerous precedent puts all Americans in danger and should be condemned by civil liberties organizations like the ACLU. Dershowitz, despite his political affiliation, has been shunned by left-leaning media outlets like CNN for his dissent from the "party line." He concludes that these outlets are "misleading" their viewers by only presenting one side of the argument.
