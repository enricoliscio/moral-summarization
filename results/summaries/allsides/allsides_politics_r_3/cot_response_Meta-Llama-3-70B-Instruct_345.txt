SUMMARY:
Harvard Law School professor and self-described liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under the murderous dictator Josef Stalin for their efforts to impeach President Trump. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and are "desperate" in their efforts to impeach Trump, which is a "danger" to all Americans. He criticized CNN and MSNBC for their biased treatment, saying they are "misleading" their viewers. Dershowitz, who has been scorned by Democrats for his criticism of their impeachment efforts, argued that the ACLU should be "up in arms" over the Democrats' actions, but they are "silent". He concluded that the Democrats' efforts are a threat to the Constitution and that every American should be "frightened" by their actions. END OF SUMMARY.
