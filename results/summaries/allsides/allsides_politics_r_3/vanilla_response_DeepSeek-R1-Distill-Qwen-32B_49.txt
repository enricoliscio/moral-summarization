Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor and a self-described liberal Democrat, criticizing congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump. He compares them to Stalin's secret police, which is a strong statement. 

He mentions that Democrats are creating crimes out of nothing, using examples like collusion and obstruction of Congress. He argues that these aren't actual crimes as defined in the statutes. He also points out that obstruction of Congress isn't a crime but part of the checks and balances system. 

Dershowitz warns that this approach is dangerous and that the ACLU isn't speaking up, which he finds concerning. He's been appearing more on Fox News lately and feels CNN has banned him because they don't want a liberal Democrat presenting the truth about the Constitution. 

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points concisely. I should mention his criticism, the comparison to Stalin, the specific examples of made-up crimes, his concern about danger to democracy, the ACLU's silence, and his media situation. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, harshly criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, likening them to Stalin's Russian secret police. He accused them of "making up crimes" to justify impeachment, citing examples like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual crimes under federal statutes. Dershowitz warned that this approach threatens democracy and called on the ACLU to speak out, though they remain silent. He also criticized CNN for banning him from their network, claiming they prefer to parrot the party line rather than present constitutional truths. Dershowitz, who has been a frequent guest on Fox News, has faced diminished invitations from left-leaning media due to his criticism of the impeachment process. END OF SUMMARY.
