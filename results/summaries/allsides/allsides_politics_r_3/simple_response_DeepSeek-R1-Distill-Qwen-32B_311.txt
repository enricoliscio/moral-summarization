Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Alan Dershowitz criticizing Democrats for impeachment. He compares them to Stalin's secret police, which is a strong moral statement. I should highlight his main points: the Democrats are making up crimes, like collusion and obstruction, which aren't actual crimes. He mentions the ACLU's silence, implying they should be concerned. Also, he's been excluded from left-leaning media, which he sees as censorship. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key moral arguments and the comparison to Stalin. Make sure to include that he's a liberal Democrat who's now criticized by his party. Keep the language clear and concise, maintaining the original moral tone.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, harshly criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, likening them to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin. He accused them of "making up crimes" to justify impeachment, citing examples like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that this approach threatens democracy, comparing it to the tactics of Stalin's KGB chief, Lavrentiy Beria. He also criticized media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for promoting these unfounded charges, claiming they are biased and silencing dissenting voices. Dershowitz, who supports Trump's defense, has faced backlash from Democrats and left-leaning media, with CNN banning him from their shows. He argued that the ACLU should be concerned about this erosion of constitutional principles but has remained silent. Dershowitz's comments reflect a moral critique of the Democrats' tactics, warning of the dangers of political overreach and the manipulation of the law for partisan gain. END OF SUMMARY.
