SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, strongly criticized congressional Democrats, drawing comparisons to the Russian secret police under Stalin due to their efforts to impeach President Trump and create crimes out of nothing. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are making up crimes like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which are not actual crimes under federal law. He warned that this means all Americans are in danger, as crimes are being invented to suit political agendas. Dershowitz also criticized left-leaning media outlets like CNN for banning him and not allowing a liberal Democrat to present a different perspective to their viewers. He accused them of parroting the party line and misleading their audience. Dershowitz's stance against Trump's impeachment has led to scorn from Democrats and fewer invitations from left-leaning media, despite his longstanding liberal Democrat identity.
