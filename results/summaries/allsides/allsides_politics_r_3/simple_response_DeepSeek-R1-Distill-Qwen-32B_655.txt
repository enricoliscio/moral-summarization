Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. The article is about Alan Dershowitz criticizing congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against Trump. He compares them to Stalin's secret police, which is a strong moral statement. 

First, I should identify the key points. Dershowitz is a Harvard professor and a self-described liberal Democrat, which adds context to his criticism. He's comparing the Democrats to the KGB under Stalin, which is a serious accusation implying they're making up crimes. He mentions specific points like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," arguing these aren't actual crimes as defined. 

He also talks about the media, particularly CNN and MSNBC, saying they're creating crimes out of nothing. He feels the ACLU should be concerned but isn't. His main argument is that Democrats are fabricating charges, which endangers everyone. 

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: who Dershowitz is, his comparison to Stalin's regime, his arguments about the non-existence of the crimes, the media's role, and the implication that this threatens democracy. Also, note his shift in media appearances due to his stance.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral framing he's using, which is about the dangers of creating false charges and undermining democratic principles.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, likening them to Stalin-era Russian secret police. He accused them of fabricating crimes, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not defined in federal law. Dershowitz warned that this approach threatens democracy and called out media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for promoting these accusations. He also criticized the ACLU for not speaking out against these practices. Dershowitz, who supports Trump's impeachment defense, has faced reduced media appearances on left-leaning platforms, which he attributes to bias. His comments highlight concerns about constitutional overreach and the dangers of creating crimes to justify political actions. END OF SUMMARY.
