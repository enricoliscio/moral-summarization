SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their "efforts" to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing," citing the example of accusing someone of a crime for naming the whistleblower in the Ukrainian situation, despite there being no such crime in federal criminal statutes. He criticized Democrats for "making up" crimes such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he claimed are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that this "danger" means "we are all in danger." He also accused the ACLU of being "silent" on the matter and criticized CNN for their "biased treatment," saying they have "banned" him from their airwaves and only want to feature people who "parrot the party line" and "mislead" their viewers.

END OF SUMMARY.
