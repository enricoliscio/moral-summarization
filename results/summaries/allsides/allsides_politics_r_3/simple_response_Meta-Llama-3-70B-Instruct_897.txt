SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and creating a dangerous precedent where anyone can be accused of a crime without evidence. He cited examples of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he claims are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that this approach puts all Americans in danger and criticized the ACLU for remaining silent. He also accused CNN and MSNBC of biased reporting, claiming that he has been banned from CNN's airwaves for presenting a liberal Democrat perspective that contradicts the party line. Dershowitz's criticism of Democrats' impeachment efforts has led to him being ostracized by his own party.
