SUMMARY: Alan Dershowitz, a liberal Democrat and Harvard Law School professor, has slammed congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz accuses Democrats of making up crimes and creating a frightening situation for all Americans. He claims they are desperate to impeach Trump and are willing to twist the law to do so. Dershowitz argues that the Democrats are misleading the public and the ACLU should speak up, but they remain silent. He himself has been scorned and banned by left-leaning media outlets for criticizing their biased treatment and parroting the party line. Dershowitz concludes that the Democrats are undermining the Constitution and the checks and balances it establishes. END OF SUMMARY.
