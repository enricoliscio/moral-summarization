SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, has slammed congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin for their dangerous efforts to impeach President Trump and make up crimes. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which are not actual crimes under US federal law. He warned that this means all Americans are in danger, as the Democrats are creating crimes out of nothing. Dershowitz criticized the left-leaning media, particularly CNN and MSNBC, for misleading their viewers and banning him from their airwaves because he, as a liberal Democrat, is telling the truth about the Constitution. Dershowitz's criticism highlights the divisive nature of the impeachment process and the potential threat it poses to the checks and balances of the US Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
