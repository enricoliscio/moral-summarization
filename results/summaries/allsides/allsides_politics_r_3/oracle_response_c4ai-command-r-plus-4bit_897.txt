SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin for their immoral efforts to impeach President Trump. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing" to suit their political agenda. He specifically criticized the claims of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," stating that these are not actual crimes and that Democrats are misleading the public. Dershowitz warned that such actions put all Americans in danger and that the ACLU should speak up against these immoral attempts to undermine the Constitution. Dershowitz, a liberal Democrat himself, has faced backlash and censorship from left-leaning media outlets for his criticism of the impeachment efforts. He accused CNN of banning him from their network to prevent their viewers from hearing a liberal Democrat defend Trump's constitutional rights. Dershowitz concluded that the media is "parroting the party line" and misleading their audience. END OF SUMMARY.
