SUMMARY:
Harvard Law School professor and self-described liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats, comparing their impeachment efforts to the Russian secret police under the "murderous" dictator Josef Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "frightening" Americans by trying to "create crimes out of nothing." He criticized CNN and MSNBC for their "biased" treatment, saying they are "misleading" their viewers by parroting the party line. Dershowitz, a longtime liberal Democrat, has been "scorned" by Democrats for criticizing their impeachment efforts. He argued that the ACLU should be "up in arms" about the Democrats' actions, but they are "silent." Dershowitz concluded that the Democrats' desperate efforts to impeach President Trump mean "we are all in danger." END OF SUMMARY.
