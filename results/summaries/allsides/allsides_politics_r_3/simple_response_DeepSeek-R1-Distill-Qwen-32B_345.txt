Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor and a self-described liberal Democrat, criticizing congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against Trump. He compares them to the Russian secret police under Stalin, which is a strong moral statement. He's saying that Democrats are creating crimes out of nothing, similar to how Beria made up crimes for Stalin.

He mentions that CNN and MSNBC are suggesting that naming the whistleblower is a crime, but he couldn't find such a statute. He argues that terms like collusion and obstruction of Congress aren't actual crimes, except for obstruction of justice. He believes Democrats are making up crimes to impeach Trump, which puts everyone in danger.

Dershowitz is a Democrat but is now criticized by his party for his stance. He's been on Fox News but not on left-leaning media. He accuses CNN of banning him to avoid the truth about the Constitution.

So, the summary needs to capture that Dershowitz is a liberal Democrat criticizing his party, comparing them to Stalin's secret police, arguing they're inventing crimes, and that this is a danger to everyone. Also, note his media treatment.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: his criticism, the moral comparison, the invented crimes, the danger, and his media situation.

I should make sure to include that he's a liberal Democrat who's now being scorned by his party, and that he's arguing against the impeachment process, claiming it's unconstitutional and dangerous.

Alright, putting it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, harshly criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, likening them to the Russian secret police under Stalin. He accused them of inventing crimes, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual offenses. Dershowitz warned that this approach threatens constitutional principles and endangers all Americans. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC for promoting the idea that naming the whistleblower in the Ukraine case would be a crime, which he claimed lacks legal basis. Dershowitz, who supports Trump's impeachment defense, has faced backlash from Democrats and been banned from CNN, which he claims is an attempt to suppress dissenting views. He argued that the ACLU should oppose these actions but remains silent. His comments highlight his growing alienation from his party and his focus on constitutional integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
