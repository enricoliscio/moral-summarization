SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz criticized congressional Democrats for their handling of the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, drawing a comparison to the tactics of the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are inventing crimes to fit their narrative, a practice reminiscent of Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB under Stalin, who infamously stated he could find a crime to charge anyone with. Dershowitz specifically addressed the accusations of collusion and obstruction of Congress, stating that neither accusation holds legal weight. He warned that the Democrats' actions threaten the freedoms of all Americans and expressed disappointment in the silence of the ACLU. Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, has faced backlash from his party for his criticism of the impeachment efforts and has been banned from appearing on CNN. He accused the network of silencing his perspective as a liberal Democrat who defends the Constitution. Dershowitz concluded by expressing concern over the misleading nature of left-leaning media coverage.
