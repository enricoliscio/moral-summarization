SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats on Sunday, comparing their impeachment efforts against President Trump to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" to justify impeachment, citing the examples of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he claims are not actual crimes. He warned that this approach puts all Americans in danger and that the ACLU should be speaking out against it. Dershowitz, who has been critical of impeachment efforts, has been ostracized by Democrats and left-leaning media outlets, including CNN, which he claims has banned him from their airwaves. He accused CNN of biased reporting and misleading their viewers by only featuring guests who parrot the party line.
