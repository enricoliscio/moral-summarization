SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their attempts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing," undermining the rule of law and endangering the freedoms of all Americans. He cited the absence of criminal statutes regarding collusion with a foreign country and the misuse of the term "obstruction of Congress," arguing that non-compliance with congressional subpoenas is a legitimate exercise of executive privilege and checks and balances. Dershowitz warned that the Democrats' actions mean "we are all in danger," expressing disappointment in the silence of the ACLU. He also criticized CNN for banning him due to his defense of constitutional principles, while allowing partisan commentators to mislead their viewers. Dershowitz's stance has led to his ostracism by Democrats and favored status among right-leaning media outlets.
