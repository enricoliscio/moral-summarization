SUMMARY:
Harvard Law School professor and self-described liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats, comparing their efforts to impeach President Trump to the Russian secret police under the "murderous" dictator Josef Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes out of nothing" and "desperate" to impeach Trump, which is "frightening" for all Americans. He criticized CNN and MSNBC for saying that naming the whistleblower would be a "crime", which he couldn't find in federal criminal statutes. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" and being "biased" in their treatment of Trump. He lamented that the ACLU is "silent" on the matter, and that CNN has "banned" him from their airwaves for telling the "truth" about the Constitution. Dershowitz warned that if Democrats continue to "make up crimes", we are all in "danger". END OF SUMMARY.
