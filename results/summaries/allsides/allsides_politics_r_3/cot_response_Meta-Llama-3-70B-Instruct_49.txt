SUMMARY:
Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin's "murderous" regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes out of nothing" and are "desperate" in their attempts to impeach Trump. He criticized CNN and MSNBC for their "biased" treatment, saying they are "misleading" their viewers by parroting the party line. Dershowitz warned that every American should be "frightened" by the Democrats' efforts, as they are "in danger" of losing their rights. He also lamented that the ACLU is "silent" on the issue, and that he has been "scorned" by Democrats for his criticism of their impeachment efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
