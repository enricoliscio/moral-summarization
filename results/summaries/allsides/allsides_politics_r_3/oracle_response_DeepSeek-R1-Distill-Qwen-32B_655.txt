Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard professor and self-described liberal Democrat, criticizes congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against Trump. He compares them to Stalin's secret police, which is a strong moral statement. He accuses them of creating crimes out of nothing, using terms like "create," "make," and "made." 

He mentions specific accusations like collusion and obstruction, pointing out that these aren't actual crimes. He also talks about the danger this poses to everyone, which is another moral frame. He criticizes CNN and MSNBC for biased treatment, using words like "banned," "allow," and "parroting." 

I need to make sure the summary includes these words and maintains the critical tone towards Democrats. I'll structure the summary to highlight Dershowitz's accusations, the moral implications, and his criticism of media bias. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all key points. 

I'll start by introducing Dershowitz and his criticism, then list the moral terms as he uses them. I'll mention the specific accusations, the danger, and the media bias. Finally, I'll note his diminishing appearances on left-leaning media. 

I should avoid any markdown and keep the summary clear and within the word limit. Making sure the moral framing is preserved is crucial, so I'll use the exact words provided as much as possible without making the summary too verbose.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to Stalin's secret police. He accused them of creating crimes out of nothing, such as collusion and obstruction, which he argued are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that this "making up of crimes" puts everyone in danger and criticized the ACLU for remaining silent. He also lambasted CNN and MSNBC for biased treatment, claiming they banned him from their networks for speaking the truth about the Constitution. Instead, these outlets rely on parroting the party line, misleading viewers. Dershowitz, who has appeared regularly on Fox News, lamented the lack of invitations from left-leaning media, emphasizing the moral peril of Democrats' impeachment efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
