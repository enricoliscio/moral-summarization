SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-proclaimed liberal Democrat, strongly criticized congressional Democrats, likening their efforts to impeach President Trump to the tactics of the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress" in their desperate attempts to impeach the president. He argued that these efforts are a threat to all Americans and undermine our constitutional checks and balances. Dershowitz, despite his political affiliation, has faced scorn from Democrats and left-leaning media for his stance against impeachment. He specifically called out CNN for banning him from their network, alleging that they are silencing his perspective to mislead their viewers and push a partisan narrative. Dershowitz warned that the Democrats' willingness to create crimes out of thin air puts everyone in danger and that organizations like the ACLU should be speaking up. He concluded that the Democrats are abandoning their principles and engaging in dangerous and misleading behavior.
