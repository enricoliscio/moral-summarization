SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their "efforts" to impeach President Trump, likening them to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing." He criticized their claims of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," stating that these are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that this "danger" is a threat to all Americans, as it sets a precedent for making up crimes. He also accused the ACLU of being "silent" on the issue. Dershowitz, who has been critical of impeachment efforts, has been "banned" from CNN and other left-leaning media outlets, which he claims are "misleading" their viewers by only presenting one side of the argument.

END OF SUMMARY.
