SUMMARY: Renowned Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats, drawing parallels between their actions and the infamous KGB under Stalin. Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized their attempts to impeach President Trump, accusing them of "making up crimes" to suit their agenda. He cited the absence of criminal statutes in the Ukrainian situation and rebuked left-leaning media for propagating false narratives. Dershowitz likened their behavior to that of Lavrentiy Beria, who infamously stated, "Show me the man, and I'll find you the crime." He asserted that Democrats are fabricating charges, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," neither of which are actual crimes under applicable statutes. Dershowitz warned that such actions endanger all Americans and that organizations like the ACLU should be speaking out against these injustices. He also decried CNN's ban on his appearances, suggesting they are silencing a liberal Democrat who offers a different perspective that challenges their biased narrative. Dershowitz's stance has led to his ostracization by Democrats and left-leaning media, highlighting the moral implications of their actions and the threat they pose to democratic values. 

END OF SUMMARY.
