SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and creating a dangerous precedent where anyone can be accused of a crime without evidence. He cited the examples of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which are not actual crimes, and warned that this approach puts everyone in danger. Dershowitz also criticized CNN and MSNBC for their biased reporting, saying they are misleading their viewers by parroting the party line. He claimed that CNN has banned him from their airwaves because they don't want a liberal Democrat to tell the truth about the Constitution. Dershowitz's comments highlight the dangers of political opportunism and the importance of upholding the rule of law.
