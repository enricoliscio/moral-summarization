SUMMARY: Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor and liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their attempts to impeach President Trump, drawing comparisons to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are creating crimes out of nothing and making them up as they go along in their efforts to impeach Trump. He specifically refuted the existence of crimes such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," stating that obstruction of justice is a crime but obstruction of Congress is part of the system of checks and balances. Dershowitz warned that such actions put all Americans in danger and criticized the ACLU for their silence on the matter. He also called out CNN for banning him from their network, alleging that they do not want a liberal Democrat presenting a different viewpoint to their viewers. Dershowitz's stance against Trump's impeachment has led to backlash from Democrats and fewer invitations from left-leaning media outlets.
END OF SUMMARY.
