SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, strongly criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" by trying to create criminal offenses out of thin air, citing the example of the whistleblower's identity being potentially leaked. He noted that there is no federal crime for naming the whistleblower, and that Democrats are attempting to criminalize actions that are not illegal. Dershowitz also criticized the media, particularly CNN and MSNBC, for parroting the Democratic party line and misleading their viewers. He lamented that the ACLU is silent on the matter, and that as a result, all Americans should be "frightened" by the Democrats' actions. Dershowitz's criticism has led to him being ostracized by Democrats and left-leaning media outlets.
