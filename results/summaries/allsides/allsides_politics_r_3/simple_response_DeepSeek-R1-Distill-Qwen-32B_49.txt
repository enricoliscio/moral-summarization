Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. The article is about Alan Dershowitz criticizing congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump. He compares them to the Russian secret police under Stalin, which is a strong moral statement. I should make sure that the summary includes this comparison and his argument that the Democrats are inventing crimes.

I'll start by identifying the main points: Dershowitz's comparison, his argument about the lack of specific crimes, his mention of CNN and MSNBC's coverage, and his criticism of the ACLU's silence. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key moral arguments without going into too much detail.

I should also mention that Dershowitz, despite being a liberal Democrat, is now facing criticism from his party for his stance. This adds context to his position. I'll structure the summary to first introduce his criticism, then explain his arguments about the invented crimes, reference the media's role, and conclude with the impact on his media appearances.

I need to ensure that the moral framing, like the Stalin comparison and the concern for constitutional integrity, is clearly conveyed. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language straightforward, making sure each sentence flows logically to the next.

Let me piece this together, ensuring each main point is covered succinctly. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once the summary is drafted, I'll review it to make sure it captures the essence of the article and the moral perspective presented by Dershowitz.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin. He accused them of inventing crimes, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual offenses. Dershowitz claimed that the Democrats' actions threaten constitutional integrity and warned that this could endanger all Americans. He also criticized media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for biased coverage, stating they refuse to air his views, which he believes are truthful and constitutional. Despite his liberal leanings, Dershowitz has faced scorn from Democrats for his criticism of their impeachment strategy, leading to reduced appearances on left-leaning media. He expressed concern that the ACLU, a civil liberties group, has remained silent on the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
