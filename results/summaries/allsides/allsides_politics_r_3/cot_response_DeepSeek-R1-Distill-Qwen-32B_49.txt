Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the query. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words in the article, then write a concise summary using those words.

Looking at the article, Alan Dershowitz is criticizing Democrats for their impeachment efforts against Trump. He compares them to the Russian secret police under Stalin, which is a strong moral statement. Words like "slammed," "frightened," "create crimes out of nothing," "murderous dictator," "KGB," "making up crimes," "desperate," "danger," "checks and balances," "truth," "Constitution," "banned," "parroting," and "misleading" all carry moral connotations. These words frame the Democrats' actions as unethical and dangerous.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these words to maintain the moral tone. I'll start by stating Dershowitz's criticism, then his comparison to Stalin, followed by his arguments about the lack of real crimes and the constitutional checks. I'll also mention his frustration with media bias, specifically CNN banning him. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

I should structure it by first introducing Dershowitz and his main criticism, then delve into his specific points about the crimes and constitutional issues, and conclude with his media criticism. That should cover all the key points and maintain the moral perspective he's using.

**SUMMARY:**  
Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin. He accused them of "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing," likening their actions to the unethical practices of Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin's KGB chief. Dershowitz argued that the Democrats' claims of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress" lack legal basis, as there is no crime of collusion with a foreign country and obstruction of Congress is part of the constitutional system of checks and balances. He warned that this approach puts all Americans in danger and criticized the ACLU for remaining silent. Dershowitz also accused CNN of banning him from their airwaves for not parroting the party line, claiming they are misleading viewers by avoiding the truth about the Constitution. His criticism has led to reduced appearances on left-leaning media, while he remains a regular guest on Fox News.
