Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I'll read the article to understand the context. Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor and a self-described liberal Democrat, is criticizing congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump. He compares them to Stalin's secret police, which is a strong moral statement. He's arguing that Democrats are making up crimes to impeach Trump, which he sees as dangerous.

Now, the user wants me to identify all single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "slammed," "murderous," "frightened," "create crimes," "nothing," "making up crimes," "desperate," "danger," "silent," "biased," "misleading," "truth," and "checks and balances." These words are used to convey moral judgment or evaluation.

Next, I need to summarize the article, preserving as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by introducing Dershowitz and his criticism, then mention the comparison to Stalin. I'll include his points about making up crimes, the specific examples like collusion and obstruction, and his concern about the danger to democracy. I'll also note his criticism of CNN and his reduced appearances on left-leaning media.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral points without being too verbose. I'll check that all the identified moral words are included where appropriate. Finally, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think I've covered all the steps. Let me put it all together now.

**SUMMARY:**  
Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, comparing them to Stalin's secret police. He accused them of "making up crimes" to justify impeachment, citing examples like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that this approach threatens democracy and called on the ACLU to speak out, though they remain silent. He also criticized CNN for banning him from their airwaves, claiming they prefer to "parrot the party line" rather than discuss the Constitution. Dershowitz, who now frequently appears on Fox News, argues that the Democrats' actions are desperate and dangerous, undermining constitutional checks and balances. END OF SUMMARY.
