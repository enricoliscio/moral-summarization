SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz criticized congressional Democrats for their handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, drawing comparisons to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" and creating a dangerous precedent that threatens the freedoms of all Americans. He argued that there is no crime of collusion or obstruction of Congress as Democrats have claimed, and that the Democrats are abusing their power. Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, has been criticized by his own party for his defense of Trump and has been banned from appearing on CNN. He believes his viewpoints are being censored because they contradict the network's narrative. Dershowitz warned that the Democrats' actions could lead to a dangerous erosion of civil liberties and that all Americans should be concerned.
