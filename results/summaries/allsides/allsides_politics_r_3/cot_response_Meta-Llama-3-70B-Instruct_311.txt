SUMMARY:
Harvard Law School professor and self-described liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats, comparing them to the Russian secret police under the "murderous" dictator Josef Stalin for their efforts to impeach President Trump. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "desperate" to impeach Trump, which is a "danger" to all Americans. He criticized Democrats for trying to "create crimes out of nothing" and for their "biased" treatment of the issue. Dershowitz also lambasted CNN for banning him from their airwaves, saying they don't want a liberal Democrat to tell their viewers the "truth" about the Constitution. He warned that the ACLU should be "up in arms" about the Democrats' actions, but they are "silent". END OF SUMMARY.
