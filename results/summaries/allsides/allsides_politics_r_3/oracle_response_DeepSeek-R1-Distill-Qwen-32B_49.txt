Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral implications.

The article discusses Alan Dershowitz's criticism of congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump. He compares them to the Russian secret police under Stalin, which is a strong moral statement. He accuses them of creating crimes out of nothing, using terms like "create," "make," and "made." He mentions specific accusations like collusion and obstruction, which are key points in the impeachment process.

I should note that Dershowitz is a liberal Democrat but is being scorned by his party for his criticism. He's appeared on Fox News but not on left-leaning media, which adds to the moral framing about bias and silencing opposing views. He accuses CNN of banning him, using words like "banned" and "allow," which are part of the moral language.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the specified words as possible. I need to ensure that words like "efforts," "impeach," "create," "make," "collude," "obstruction," "danger," "silent," "treatment," "banned," "allow," "want," "parroting," and "misleading" are included.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Dershowitz's comparison, then his arguments about the Democrats creating crimes, the specific accusations, and his criticism of media bias. I'll make sure to highlight the moral implications he's emphasizing, such as danger to constitutional principles and the silencing of dissent.

Let me draft a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words, and include the specified moral terms. I'll ensure it flows logically, starting with the comparison, then the accusations, and ending with the media treatment and the ACLU's silence.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin. He accused them of creating crimes out of nothing, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that these "made-up" charges put the nation in danger, as they undermine constitutional principles. He also criticized CNN and MSNBC for their biased treatment, claiming they have banned him from their airwaves to avoid presenting opposing views. Dershowitz argued that the Democrats' actions, including their "parroting" of the party line, are misleading the public and silencing dissent. Despite his liberal leanings, Dershowitz has faced scorn from Democrats for his criticism of their impeachment efforts. END OF SUMMARY.
