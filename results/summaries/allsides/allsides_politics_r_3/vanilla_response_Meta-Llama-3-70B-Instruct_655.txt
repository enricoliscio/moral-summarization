SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and claimed that there is no crime of collusion or obstruction of Congress. He stated that the ACLU should be concerned about this development, but they are silent. Dershowitz, who has been critical of impeachment efforts, has been shunned by left-leaning media corporations, including CNN, which has banned him from their airwaves. He accused CNN of only featuring guests who parrot the party line and mislead their viewers. Dershowitz warned that every American should be "frightened" by the Democrats' efforts to "create crimes out of nothing."
