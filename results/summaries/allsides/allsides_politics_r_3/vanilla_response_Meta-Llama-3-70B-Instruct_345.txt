SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump. He compared their actions to those of the Russian secret police under Josef Stalin, saying they are "making up crimes" to justify impeachment. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are misinterpreting the law, citing examples such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which are not actual crimes. He claimed that the ACLU should be speaking out against these actions, but they are silent. Dershowitz has faced backlash from Democrats for his criticism of their impeachment efforts and has been banned from CNN's airwaves. He accused the network of only featuring guests who parrot the party line and mislead viewers.
