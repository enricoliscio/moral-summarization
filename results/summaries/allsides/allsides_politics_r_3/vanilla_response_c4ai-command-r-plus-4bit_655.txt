SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz criticized congressional Democrats for their handling of the impeachment process against President Trump, drawing a comparison to the tactics of the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz accused Democrats of inventing crimes and abusing their power, specifically mentioning the accusations of collusion and obstruction of Congress. He expressed concern that this sets a dangerous precedent and puts all Americans at risk. Dershowitz also criticized left-leaning media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for their biased coverage and suppression of dissenting voices, including his own. He argued that they are misleading their viewers by presenting a one-sided narrative. Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, has faced backlash from his party for his defense of Trump and his criticism of the impeachment process.
