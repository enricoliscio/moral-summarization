SUMMARY:
Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, strongly criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, drawing parallels to the ruthless tactics of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's secret police. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" and creating a chilling atmosphere where people live in *danger*. He cited the absence of criminal statutes to support his argument, invoking the infamous quote by Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin's KGB chief, about finding a crime to fit the desired target. Dershowitz expressed dismay at the *misleading* nature of left-leaning media, claiming that CNN had *banned* him for his contrarian views on impeachment. Dershowitz, despite his political affiliation, has become a vocal critic of the Democrats' impeachment crusade, arguing that they are overreaching and undermining the Constitution's checks and balances. He believes that their attempts to criminalize actions like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress" are baseless and pose a threat to all Americans. Dershowitz's stance has earned him scorn from Democrats but a regular spot on Fox News. END OF SUMMARY.
