SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, strongly criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump. Dershowitz likened their actions to those of the Russian secret police under Stalin, accusing them of "making up crimes" to justify impeachment. He argued that the Democrats' claims of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress" are not actual crimes, and that their attempts to create new crimes out of thin air are a threat to democracy. Dershowitz expressed concern that the ACLU has remained silent on the issue, and accused CNN and MSNBC of biased reporting, saying they have banned him from their airwaves for presenting a liberal Democrat perspective that challenges the party line. Dershowitz warned that if Democrats are allowed to "make up crimes," it poses a danger to all Americans.
