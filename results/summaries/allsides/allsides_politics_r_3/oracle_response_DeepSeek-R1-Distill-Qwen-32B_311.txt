Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor and self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump. He compared them to Stalin's secret police, which is a strong moral statement. The author used words like "efforts," "impeach," "create," "make," "collude," "obstruction," "danger," and others that carry moral weight.

Dershowitz argues that Democrats are creating crimes out of nothing, like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he claims aren't actual crimes. He mentions that the ACLU is silent, implying they should be concerned about this misuse of power. He also criticizes CNN for banning him, suggesting they're parroting the party line and misleading viewers.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of these morally charged words as possible. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to reflect Dershowitz's strong criticism and the moral implications he's highlighting.

Let me outline the key points:
1. Dershowitz criticizes Democrats' impeachment efforts.
2. Compares them to Stalin's secret police.
3. Accuses them of creating crimes like collusion and obstruction.
4. Points out that these aren't actual crimes.
5. Mentions ACLU's silence.
6. Criticizes CNN for not allowing him on their network.
7. Accuses CNN of parroting the party line and misleading.

Now, I'll craft the summary, making sure to include the moral words and maintain the tone of the original article.
