SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor and self-described liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz slammed congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, likening them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing" in their desperate effort to impeach Trump. He criticized their claims of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," stating that these are not actual crimes. Dershowitz warned that this approach puts everyone in danger, as it allows for the arbitrary creation of crimes. He also accused the ACLU of being silent on the matter. Dershowitz, who has been critical of Democrats' impeachment efforts, claimed that CNN has banned him from their airwaves because they don't want a liberal Democrat to tell the truth about the Constitution. Instead, they have people parroting the party line, misleading their viewers.
