SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, likening them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing" in their desperate effort to impeach Trump. He criticized the media, particularly CNN and MSNBC, for saying that naming the whistleblower in the Ukrainian situation would be a crime, despite finding no such crime in federal criminal statutes. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "just making crimes up" and warned that this poses a danger to all Americans. He also lambasted CNN for their biased treatment, saying they have banned him from their airwaves because they don't want a liberal Democrat to tell the truth about the Constitution. Dershowitz concluded that the ACLU should be up in arms, but they are silent, and that Democrats are misleading their viewers by parroting the party line.
