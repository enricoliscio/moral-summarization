SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, slammed congressional Democrats for their "efforts" to impeach President Trump, likening them to the Russian secret police under Stalin's regime. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing," citing the example of claiming that naming the whistleblower in the Ukrainian situation would be a crime. He criticized the media, particularly CNN and MSNBC, for "saying" that this would be a crime, despite there being no such statute. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "obstruction" and "collusion" with the media, claiming they are "just making crimes up" in a desperate "effort" to impeach Trump. He warned that this poses a "danger" to all Americans and criticized the ACLU for being "silent" on the matter. Dershowitz also lambasted CNN for their "biased treatment," saying they have "banned" him from their airwaves because they don't "want" a liberal Democrat to tell the truth about the Constitution.
