Okay, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Alan Dershowitz is criticizing Democrats for their impeachment efforts, comparing them to Stalin's secret police. He's saying they're making up crimes, like collusion and obstruction, which aren't actual crimes. He's worried this sets a dangerous precedent and criticizes CNN for not letting him on their shows. 

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used: efforts, impeach, create, saying, make, making, made, collude, obstruction, effort, danger, up, silent, treatment, banned, allow, want, parroting, misleading. I should include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I'll start by introducing Dershowitz and his comparison to Stalin. Then, mention his points about the Democrats creating crimes out of nothing, specifically collusion and obstruction. I should note that he found no such crimes in the statutes. Then, talk about his concern for danger and the ACLU's silence. Finally, mention his criticism of CNN for banning him and their biased treatment.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a key point. Let me make sure to include all the important terms without making it too wordy.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their efforts to impeach President Trump, comparing them to Stalin's secret police for "making up crimes." He argued that the Democrats' claims of "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress" lack legal basis, with no crime of collusion with a foreign country and obstruction of Congress being part of constitutional checks and balances. Dershowitz warned that creating crimes out of nothing puts everyone in danger, yet the ACLU remains silent. He also accused CNN of banning him from their airwaves, claiming they prefer parroting the party line over presenting the truth about the Constitution. Dershowitz, who has been a regular on Fox News, lamented the biased treatment by left-leaning media, which he claims misleads viewers. END OF SUMMARY.
