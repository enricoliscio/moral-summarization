SUMMARY: In a recent interview, prominent liberal Democrat and Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz criticized congressional Democrats for their handling of the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, drawing comparisons to the Stalin-era Russian secret police. Dershowitz accused Democrats of inventing crimes to fit their political agenda, a tactic reminiscent of Lavrentiy Beria, who infamously stated, "Show me the man and I'll find you the crime." Dershowitz argued that the Democrats are abusing their power by creating false charges, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," to impeach the president. He warned that such actions endanger the freedoms of all Americans and should be condemned by civil liberties organizations like the ACLU. Dershowitz also criticized left-leaning media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for contributing to the spread of misinformation and suppressing dissenting voices, such as his own, that challenge the narrative they wish to promote. Dershowitz's stance against the impeachment of President Trump has led to backlash from his fellow Democrats and a shift in his media appearances, with more invitations from conservative outlets and fewer from liberal ones.
