Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Alan Dershowitz's comments on the Democrats' impeachment efforts. They provided the article and specific instructions on how to format the summary. I need to make sure I capture the main points without going over 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the gist. Dershowitz is comparing the Democrats to Stalin's secret police, which is a strong statement. He's criticizing their impeachment process, saying they're making up crimes. He mentions collusion and obstruction, pointing out that these aren't actual crimes as the Democrats present them. 

He also talks about media bias, specifically CNN banning him from their shows. His support for Trump has made him less welcome on left-leaning media, but he's still on Fox News. 

I need to structure the summary to include his main arguments: the comparison to Stalin, the invented crimes, the specific points about collusion and obstruction, and the media bias. I should keep it concise, making sure each point is clear but brief. 

I'll start with his identity and the comparison, then move to the specifics of the crimes, and end with the media situation. I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft. 

Hmm, I think that's all the key points. I should avoid any unnecessary details and stick to the main arguments. Okay, let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, comparing them to Stalin's Russian secret police. Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" to justify impeachment, citing examples like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual crimes. He emphasized that obstruction of Congress is a constitutional right, not a crime, and that the Democrats' approach threatens constitutional checks and balances. Dershowitz also criticized CNN and MSNBC for biased reporting, claiming they refuse to air his views, as they prefer to "parrot the party line." He expressed concern that the ACLU, which should oppose such overreach, remains silent. Dershowitz, who supports Trump, has been a frequent guest on Fox News but has faced diminishing invitations from left-leaning media. He warned that the Democrats' tactics could endanger American freedoms. END OF SUMMARY.
