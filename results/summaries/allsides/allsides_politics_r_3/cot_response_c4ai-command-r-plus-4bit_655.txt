SUMMARY:
Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, has strongly criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, even comparing them to the Russian secret police under murderous Stalin. Dershowitz argues that Democrats are "making up crimes" and "creating crimes out of nothing," a tactic reminiscent of Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB under Stalin. Dershowitz specifically refutes the alleged crimes of collusion and obstruction of Congress, stating that they do not exist in federal criminal statutes. He warns that such actions put all Americans in danger and that the ACLU should be speaking out. Dershowitz, despite his political affiliation, has been scorned by Democrats and banned from CNN for his criticism. He accuses the network of misleading its viewers by silencing dissenting voices like his, a liberal Democrat who defends the President's constitutional rights. Dershowitz's stance has led to his regular appearances on Fox News but a decrease in invitations from left-leaning media outlets.
