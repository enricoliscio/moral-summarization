Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor and self-described liberal Democrat, criticizing congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against Trump. He's comparing them to Stalin's secret police, which is pretty strong. 

Hmm, I need to capture the main points. Dershowitz is on a radio show, talking about how Democrats are making up crimes, like collusion and obstruction. He points out that collusion isn't a crime unless it's related to anti-trust laws. Obstruction of Congress isn't a crime either, it's part of checks and balances. 

He also mentions the media, specifically CNN and MSNBC, saying they're creating crimes out of thin air. He feels the ACLU isn't speaking up, which is concerning. Dershowitz, despite being a Democrat, is now more on Fox News and not appearing on left-leaning media. He accuses CNN of banning him to avoid telling the truth about the Constitution.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating who Dershowitz is and his main criticism. Then, outline his arguments about the made-up crimes, the media's role, and his current media situation. Keep it clear and to the point, making sure to include all key elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their impeachment efforts against President Trump, likening them to Stalin-era Russian secret police. On a radio show, Dershowitz accused Democrats of "making up crimes" to justify impeachment, citing examples like "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which he argued are not actual crimes. He compared this to Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin's KGB head, who would fabricate crimes. Dershowitz also criticized media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for promoting these claims, stating that there is no legal basis for such charges. He warned that this approach threatens constitutional principles and checks and balances. Despite his liberal leanings, Dershowitz has faced backlash from Democrats and is now frequently featured on conservative media like Fox News, while left-leaning outlets, including CNN, have banned him from their airwaves. He accused CNN of suppressing dissenting views to avoid challenging the party line. END OF SUMMARY.
