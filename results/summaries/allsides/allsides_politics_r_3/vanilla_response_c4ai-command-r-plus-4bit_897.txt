SUMMARY: Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor and liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats for their handling of the impeachment process against President Trump. Dershowitz compared the Democrats' efforts to the tactics of the Russian secret police under Stalin, accusing them of creating crimes out of nothing to suit their agenda. He argued that the Democrats are making up crimes, such as "collusion" and "obstruction of Congress," which are not actual crimes under federal law. Dershowitz warned that this approach is dangerous and puts all Americans at risk of arbitrary prosecution. He also criticized left-leaning media outlets like CNN and MSNBC for promoting these false narratives and banning dissenting voices, like himself, from their platforms. Dershowitz, despite being a Democrat himself, has been criticized by his party for his opposition to the impeachment of President Trump. He concluded that the Democrats' actions undermine the Constitution and the checks and balances it establishes.
