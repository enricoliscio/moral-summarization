SUMMARY:

Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat, criticized congressional Democrats on Sunday, comparing their impeachment efforts against President Trump to the Russian secret police under Stalin. Dershowitz argued that Democrats are "making up crimes" and creating a dangerous precedent. He cited examples of alleged crimes, such as collusion and obstruction of Congress, which he claims are not actual crimes. Dershowitz also criticized CNN and MSNBC for biased reporting, saying they are "parroting the party line" and misleading viewers. He claimed that CNN has banned him from their airwaves because they don't want a liberal Democrat to tell the truth about the Constitution. Dershowitz warned that the Democrats' actions are a threat to all Americans and that the ACLU should be speaking out against these efforts.
