SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and claims that the former vice president sought to shield his son from a Ukrainian-led investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power to boost Trump's political prospects and operating a Russian disinformation front. Johnson denies these allegations, calling himself a "nonpartisan guy" who is concerned about the integrity of the democratic process. He claims his investigation has uncovered information showing the Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the Obama team. Democrats argue that Johnson's probe is politically motivated and intended to influence the election. Johnson plans to release reports on his investigations in the summer and fall, which could thrust the issues back into the spotlight as Election Day nears.

END OF SUMMARY.
