SUMMARY:
Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, as well as claims of Russian disinformation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power and misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, which Johnson denies, claiming to be a "nonpartisan guy" concerned about the truth and democracy. Johnson's investigation has uncovered information that shows the incoming Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the outgoing Obama team, and he aims to reform the presidential transition process to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. Democrats, however, see Johnson's efforts as a misuse of his position, accusing him of running errands for the Republican National Committee. Johnson remains unfazed, calling himself a "straight shooter" who is "tenacious" and "dedicated" to getting to the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
