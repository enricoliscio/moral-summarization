SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the former vice president sought to shield his son from a Ukrainian-led investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power, misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, and operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security. Johnson insists he's a nonpartisan guy, concerned about democracy and the truth, and that his investigation aims to ensure a peaceful transition of power. However, Democrats contend that Johnson's efforts are a misuse of his position, meant to relitigate the Russia investigation and hurt Joe Biden's campaign. They argue that Johnson's priorities are out of order, as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings of unarmed African Americans. Johnson remains unfazed, claiming that Democrats are afraid of the truth and that his investigation will reveal corruption in the presidential transition process.
