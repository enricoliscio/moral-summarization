SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is leading investigations into alleged corruption involving the Obama administration and the Bidens, despite criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Johnson defends his actions as nonpartisan and necessary to ensure a peaceful transition of power, while Democrats accuse him of abusing his power and boosting Trump's political prospects. Johnson plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, which Democrats worry will thrust the issues into the spotlight during the election season. He contends that his investigations are honest efforts to find the truth and that Democrats are afraid of the truth coming out. The investigations have caused partisan tensions and intense disputes in the Senate, with some Republicans also worried about the perception that their priorities are not in order during a time of national crises. Johnson, however, remains unfazed by the criticism and maintains that he is tenacious and dedicated to getting information.
