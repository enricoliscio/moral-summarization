SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the former vice president sought to shield his son from a Ukrainian-led investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power and misusing the Senate's oversight resources to boost Trump's political prospects, jeopardizing U.S. election security. Johnson insists he's a nonpartisan guy, but privately, Senate Republicans are worried that the efforts to relitigate the Russia investigation could backfire. Johnson's probe has uncovered information that shows the incoming Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the outgoing Obama team, and he portrays his investigation as an honest effort to find the truth and reform the presidential transition process to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Democrats contend that Johnson is operating a Russian disinformation front, and his comments have been seized upon by the Trump campaign to attack Joe Biden. Johnson's actions are seen as a misuse of his position, and his investigations are gripping the Senate, amidst concerns about unemployment, police killings, and unrest.
