Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Senator Ron Johnson's investigations into Hunter Biden and the 2016 election, with both parties accusing each other of misconduct. 

The author uses words like "shield," "abusing," "misusing," "jeopardizes," etc., which carry moral implications. I need to include these words in the summary. 

I'll start by identifying the key elements: Johnson's investigations, the accusations from both sides, the political climate with the pandemic and unrest, and the moral framing. 

I should structure the summary to include Johnson's claims, the Democrats' accusations, the context of the pandemic and police brutality, and the moral terms. I'll make sure each sentence includes the necessary moral words without making it too long. 

I'll also need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but comprehensive. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered and the moral terms are preserved.

SUMMARY: Senator Ron Johnson is investigating Hunter Biden and the 2016 election, facing accusations of "abusing" power and "misusing" Senate resources to aid Trump. Democrats claim his actions "jeopardize" election security and "operating" as a Russian disinformation front. Johnson denies partisanship, claiming his work is "nonpartisan" and aimed at "ensuring" a peaceful transition of power. However, Republicans worry his efforts could "backfire" amid the pandemic, high "unemployment," and "killings" of African Americans by police. Democrats argue his investigations are timed to influence the election, with Schatz calling it a "misuse" of his position. Johnson dismisses criticism, insisting he is "dedicated" to uncovering the truth and accuses Democrats of fearing the "truth." His probe into the Obama administration's "unmasking" of Flynn's name and its ties to Biden have intensified political tensions. The situation highlights the "gripping" nature of ongoing investigations into Trump's political rivals, with Democrats accusing him of "corrupting" the transition process. Johnson remains "tenacious," questioning why Democrats are "afraid" of the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
