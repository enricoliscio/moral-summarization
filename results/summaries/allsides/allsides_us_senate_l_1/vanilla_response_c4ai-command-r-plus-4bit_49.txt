SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is facing criticism from Democrats for his investigations into alleged corruption involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and alleged wrongdoing by the Obama administration during the 2016 presidential transition. Johnson defends his actions as nonpartisan and necessary to ensure a peaceful transition of power, while Democrats accuse him of abusing his power and boosting President Trump's political prospects. Republicans are also reportedly worried that the investigations could backfire amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, economic crisis, and unrest over police brutality. Johnson maintains that he is seeking the truth and that Democrats are afraid of the findings. He plans to release reports on his investigations in the summer and fall, raising concerns among Democrats that the issues will be politicized ahead of the election.
