SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and claims that the Obama administration "sabotaged" the Trump transition team. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power to boost Trump's political prospects and operating a Russian disinformation front. Johnson denies these allegations, calling himself a "nonpartisan guy" who is concerned about the democracy and wants to uncover the truth. He plans to release reports on his investigations in the summer and fall, which could impact the election. Democrats argue that Johnson's efforts are a misuse of his position and an attempt to distract from the country's current crises, including the coronavirus pandemic and police brutality.
