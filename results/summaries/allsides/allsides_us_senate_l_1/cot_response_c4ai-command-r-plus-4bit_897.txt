SUMMARY:
Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is currently investigating two corruption allegations involving President Trump's political enemies. The first allegation concerns Trump's dealings with Russia during the 2016 election campaign, while the second involves Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and his role on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Johnson insists that he is a nonpartisan actor, dedicated to uncovering the truth and ensuring a peaceful transition of power. He claims that his investigations are honest efforts to reform the presidential transition process and that he is simply a "straight shooter". However, Democrats have accused Johnson of abusing his power, misusing Senate resources, and operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes election security. They contend that Johnson is boosting Trump's political prospects and that his investigations are partisan attempts to relitigate the Russia inquiry and smear Joe Biden. Despite partisan tensions and harsh criticism, Johnson remains unfazed, defending himself against accusations of doing Trump's bidding. He maintains that he is concerned about corruption during the transition and is tenacious in his pursuit of information. Johnson asks his Democratic colleagues: "What part of the truth are you worried about?".
