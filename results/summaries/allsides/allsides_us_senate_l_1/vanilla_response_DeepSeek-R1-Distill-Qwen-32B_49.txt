Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Ron Johnson, a Republican senator, investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. Trump and Republicans claim that Joe Biden tried to protect his son from an investigation, but Biden denies this. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power to help Trump and even suggest he's involved in Russian disinformation. Johnson, however, claims he's nonpartisan and is just trying to find the truth to ensure a peaceful transition of power.

The article also mentions that Republicans are worried these investigations might backfire, especially during the pandemic and social unrest. Democrats argue that Johnson's reports will resurface these issues before the election, and they see his actions as misusing his position. Johnson dismisses their fears, saying Democrats are afraid of the truth.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Johnson's investigations, the allegations from both sides, the concerns about timing, and the political implications. Make sure to keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.
