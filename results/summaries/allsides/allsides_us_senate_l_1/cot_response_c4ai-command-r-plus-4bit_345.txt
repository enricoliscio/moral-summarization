SUMMARY:
Ron Johnson, the Republican chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is currently investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Johnson is accused by Democrats of abusing his power and misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, as well as spreading Russian disinformation that jeopardizes election security. Johnson denies these claims, insisting he is a "nonpartisan" and "straight shooter" dedicated to uncovering the truth about alleged corruption during the presidential transition. He believes the Obama administration sabotaged the incoming Trump team, and defends his investigations as necessary for ensuring peaceful transitions of power. Democrats argue that Johnson's probes are partisan and a misuse of his position, especially during a time of national crisis with the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings. Johnson dismisses criticism, claiming Democrats are simply "afraid of the truth." Johnson's investigations into Trump's political enemies have sparked partisan tensions and harsh disputes in the Senate, with Democrats accusing him of doing the bidding of the Republican National Committee. Johnson insists he is tenacious and dedicated to getting information, asking Democrats: "What part of the truth are you worried about?".
