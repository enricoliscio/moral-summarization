SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and claims that the former vice president sought to shield his son from a Ukrainian-led investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power and misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects. Johnson denies these allegations, claiming he is a "nonpartisan guy" concerned about the democracy and the presidential transition process. He plans to release reports on his investigations in the summer and fall, which could impact the election. Democrats argue that Johnson's investigations are a misuse of his position and an attempt to relitigate the Russia investigation and 2016 election. Johnson believes Democrats are "afraid of the truth" and wants to uncover information that shows the incoming Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the outgoing Obama team.

END OF SUMMARY.
