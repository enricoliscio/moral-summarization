SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is facing criticism from Democrats for his investigations into alleged corruption by the Obama administration and Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Johnson defends his actions as nonpartisan and necessary to ensure a peaceful transition of power, while Democrats accuse him of abusing his power and boosting President Trump's political prospects. Republicans are also worried that the investigations could backfire amid the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings. Johnson remains unfazed by the criticism, insisting that he is seeking the truth and that Democrats are afraid of the findings. He plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, which Democrats argue will thrust the issues into the spotlight during the election season. The interactions between Johnson and his critics highlight the partisan tensions and the ongoing grip of investigations on the Senate.
