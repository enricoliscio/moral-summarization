SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and claims of Russian disinformation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power to boost Trump's political prospects, but Johnson insists he's nonpartisan and concerned about democracy. Johnson's probe has uncovered information that shows the incoming Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the outgoing Obama team. He plans to release reports in the summer and fall, which could impact the election. Democrats argue that Johnson's investigations are politically motivated and a misuse of his position, particularly during the pandemic and unrest over police killings. Johnson dismisses the criticism, saying he's dedicated to getting the truth and reforming the presidential transition process.

END OF SUMMARY.
