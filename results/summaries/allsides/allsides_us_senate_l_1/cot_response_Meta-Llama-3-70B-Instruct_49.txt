SUMMARY:
Senator Ron Johnson is leading investigations into corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden and the 2016 Russia investigation, which Democrats claim is an abuse of power and a misuse of Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects. Johnson insists he is a nonpartisan guy, concerned about the truth and the corruption that jeopardizes U.S. election security. He claims his investigation has uncovered information that shows the incoming Trump administration was sabotaged by the outgoing Obama team. Democrats argue that Johnson's efforts are a misuse of his position and that he is running errands for the Republican National Committee. Johnson defends himself, saying that Democrats are afraid of the truth and that he is dedicated to getting the information and revealing the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
