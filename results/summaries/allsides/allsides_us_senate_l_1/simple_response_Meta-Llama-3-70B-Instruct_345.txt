SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the Obama administration "sabotaged" the incoming Trump administration during the presidential transition. Johnson denies accusations of abusing his power and misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, insisting he is a "nonpartisan guy" seeking the truth. Democrats, however, accuse Johnson of operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security and prioritizing partisan investigations over pressing national issues like the coronavirus pandemic and police brutality. Johnson's probe has uncovered information that he claims shows the transition was "corrupted," and he plans to release reports in the summer and fall, which Democrats argue will thrust the issues back into the spotlight as Election Day nears.

END OF SUMMARY.
