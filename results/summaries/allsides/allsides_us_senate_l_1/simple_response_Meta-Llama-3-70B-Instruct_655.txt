SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is leading investigations into corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and the Obama administration's handling of the 2016 election. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power to boost Trump's political prospects and operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security. However, Johnson claims to be a "nonpartisan guy" who is simply seeking the truth and reforming the presidential transition process. Democrats argue that Johnson's investigations are politically motivated and intended to influence the upcoming election. They point to his comments about Joe Biden's son and the release of reports on his investigations, which they claim will thrust the issues back into the spotlight as Election Day nears. Johnson, on the other hand, insists that Democrats are "afraid of the truth" and that his investigations are necessary to ensure a peaceful transition of power.
