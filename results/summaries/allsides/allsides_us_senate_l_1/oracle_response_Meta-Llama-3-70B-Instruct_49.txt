SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the former vice president sought to shield his son from a Ukrainian-led investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power, misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, and operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security. Johnson insists he's a "nonpartisan guy" concerned about democracy and the presidential transition process. However, his investigation has been criticized for prioritizing political gain over addressing the country's pressing issues, such as the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and police killings of unarmed African Americans. Democrats argue that Johnson's probe is a misuse of his position, and that he's running errands for the Republican National Committee. Johnson, on the other hand, claims that Democrats are afraid of the truth and that his investigation aims to ensure a peaceful transition of power and prevent corruption.
