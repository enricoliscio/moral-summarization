SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden and relitigating the Russia investigation, sparking accusations of abusing his power and operating a Russian disinformation front. Democrats claim Johnson is misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, but Johnson insists he's nonpartisan and concerned about democracy. He believes the incoming Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the outgoing Obama team and wants to reform the presidential transition process. Democrats argue that Johnson's investigation is a political ploy to damage Joe Biden's presidential campaign, and that his priorities are misguided as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and police brutality. Johnson dismisses the criticism, saying Democrats are "afraid of the truth" and that he's dedicated to uncovering information.

END OF SUMMARY.
