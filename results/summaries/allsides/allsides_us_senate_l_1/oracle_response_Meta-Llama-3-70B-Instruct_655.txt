SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the former vice president sought to shield his son from a Ukrainian-led investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power, misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, and operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security. Johnson insists he's nonpartisan, but Democrats argue his efforts are a misuse of his position, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings of unarmed African Americans. Johnson claims his investigation has uncovered information showing the Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the Obama team, and he's determined to get to the truth, even if it means relitigating the Russia investigation and 2016 events. Democrats contend Johnson's efforts are a corruption of the democratic process, and his investigations are gripping the Senate.
