Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Sen. Ron Johnson investigating Hunter Biden and the 2016 election, with Democrats accusing him of abusing power and Republicans worried about the timing during a pandemic and racial unrest.

The author uses words like "shield," "abusing," "misusing," etc., so I need to include those in the summary. I'll structure the summary to highlight the key accusations and Johnson's defense, making sure to keep the moral tone intact. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Sen. Ron Johnson is investigating Hunter Biden's role at Burisma and the 2016 election, with Democrats accusing him of abusing power and misusing Senate resources to benefit Trump. They claim his actions jeopardize U.S. election security and distract from pressing issues like unemployment, police killings, and the pandemic. Johnson defends his work as nonpartisan, aiming to ensure a peaceful transition of power and uncover corruption. However, Democrats argue his investigations are politically motivated, with reports timed to influence the election. They criticize his misuse of position, while Johnson dismisses their fears, insisting he is dedicated to the truth. The moral framing highlights concerns about shielding, corruption, and the misuse of resources, as well as the broader context of unemployment, police brutality, and the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
