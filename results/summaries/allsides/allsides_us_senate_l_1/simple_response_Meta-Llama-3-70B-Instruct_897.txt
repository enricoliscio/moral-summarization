SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is leading investigations into corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden and the Russia investigation, which Democrats claim is an abuse of power to boost Trump's political prospects. Johnson insists he's nonpartisan and concerned about the integrity of democracy, but Democrats argue he's operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security. Johnson's investigation has uncovered information that shows the incoming Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the outgoing Obama team, and he plans to release reports in the summer and fall, which could impact the election. Democrats accuse Johnson of misusing his position to relitigate the Russia investigation and distract from pressing issues like the coronavirus pandemic and police brutality. Johnson, however, claims he's simply seeking the truth and reforming the presidential transition process.

END OF SUMMARY.
