SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is conducting investigations into alleged corruption involving the Obama administration and the Biden family, despite criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Johnson defends his inquiries as nonpartisan efforts to uncover the truth and ensure a peaceful transition of power, but Democrats accuse him of abusing his power and boosting Trump's political prospects. Johnson plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, raising concerns among Republicans that relitigating the Russia investigation could backfire. Johnson contends that Democrats are afraid of the truth and that his investigations are necessary to expose corruption during the presidential transition. He dismisses partisan tensions and insists he is a straight shooter who calls things as he sees them. The interactions between Johnson and Democratic Senator Brian Schatz illustrate the partisan divide and the ongoing grip of these investigations on the Senate.
