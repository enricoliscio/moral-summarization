SUMMARY:
Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is leading investigations into corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and the Russia probe. Johnson denies accusations of abusing his power or misusing Senate resources, instead portraying himself as a "nonpartisan" and "straight shooter." He believes the Trump administration was "sabotaged" during the transition period and aims to reform the process. Democrats argue that Johnson is running errands for the Republican National Committee and that his investigations are a misuse of his position. They also accuse him of being afraid of the truth and trying to relitigate the Russia investigation to boost Trump's reelection bid. Johnson, however, remains unfazed by the criticism and defends his dedication to uncovering the truth. He plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, potentially impacting the election. The article highlights the partisan tensions and concerns about the timing of these investigations amid the coronavirus pandemic, economic crisis, and protests against police brutality. Johnson, however, dismisses these concerns and insists on his commitment to getting to the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
