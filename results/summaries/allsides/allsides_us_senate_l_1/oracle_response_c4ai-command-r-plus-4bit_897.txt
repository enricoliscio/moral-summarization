SUMMARY: Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is facing criticism from Democrats for allegedly abusing his power and misusing Senate resources to boost President Trump's political prospects. Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, and his role in the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Johnson denies the allegations and insists he is a "nonpartisan" and "straight shooter" who is dedicated to getting to the truth and ensuring a peaceful transition of power. Democrats, however, argue that Johnson is running errands for the Republican National Committee and that his investigations are a misuse of his position, especially during a time of national crisis with the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings. They also contend that Johnson is afraid of the truth and is trying to shield Trump from scrutiny. Johnson, on the other hand, believes that the transition was corrupted and that his investigations are necessary to uncover the truth. He plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, which Democrats worry will thrust these issues back into the spotlight during the election season.
END OF SUMMARY.
