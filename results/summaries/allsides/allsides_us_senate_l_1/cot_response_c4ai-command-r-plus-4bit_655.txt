SUMMARY:
Amid the coronavirus pandemic, economic crisis, and nationwide protests against police brutality, Senate Republicans are concerned about the perception of their priorities as Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, pursues investigations into alleged corruption by the Obama administration and Joe Biden. Johnson defends his actions as nonpartisan, claiming he is seeking the truth about the "corrupted" transition process and "sabotage" of the incoming Trump administration. Democrats accuse Johnson of *abusing* his power and *misusing* Senate resources to boost Trump's reelection bid and spread Russian *disinformation*, which *jeopardizes* US election security. Johnson insists he is *tenacious* and *dedicated* to uncovering the truth, asking Democrats, "What are you afraid of?". The investigations have caused partisan tensions and harsh disputes, with Democrats claiming Johnson is running errands for the Republican National Committee and *misusing* his position. Johnson dismisses these accusations as collegial Senate interactions while standing firm on his investigations.
