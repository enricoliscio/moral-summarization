Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Ron Johnson investigating Hunter Biden and the transition between Obama and Trump administrations. 

So, Johnson is a Republican senator leading these investigations. Democrats accuse him of misusing his position to help Trump and even of Russian ties. Johnson denies this, calling himself nonpartisan. 

The article mentions that Republicans are worried these investigations might backfire, especially with the current issues like COVID and racial unrest. Johnson insists he's unbiased and is doing this for the good of democracy. 

Democrats argue that his timing is suspicious, releasing reports near the election, and that he's targeting Biden. They see it as a misuse of power. Johnson counters by saying Democrats are scared of the truth. 

I need to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should mention Johnson's investigations, the accusations from Democrats, his denial, Republican concerns, and the context of the pandemic and protests. Also, note the clash between Johnson and Democrats, his dismissal of their fears, and the political stakes involved.

Let me structure this: start with Johnson's role, the investigations, Democratic accusations, Republican worries, Johnson's defense, and the broader context. Keep it clear and within the word limit.
