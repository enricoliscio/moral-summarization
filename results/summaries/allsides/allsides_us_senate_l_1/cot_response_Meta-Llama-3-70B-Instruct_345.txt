SUMMARY:
Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, as well as the Russia investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power and misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, jeopardizing U.S. election security. Johnson claims he is a "nonpartisan guy" who is concerned about the truth and the sabotage of the presidential transition process. He believes his investigation is an honest effort to reform the process and ensure a peaceful transition of power. Democrats, however, contend that Johnson's efforts are a misuse of his position and that he is running errands for the Republican National Committee. Johnson dismisses their concerns, saying they are simply "afraid of the truth" and that he is tenacious and dedicated to getting the information. END OF SUMMARY.
