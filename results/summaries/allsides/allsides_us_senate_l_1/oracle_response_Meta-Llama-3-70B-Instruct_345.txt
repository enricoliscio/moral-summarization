SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the former vice president sought to shield his son from a Ukrainian-led investigation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power, misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, and operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security. Johnson insists he's a "nonpartisan guy" who wants to ensure a peaceful transition of power, but Democrats contend he's doing the opposite. They're worried that his efforts will backfire, especially as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings of unarmed African Americans. Johnson's investigation has uncovered information that shows the incoming Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the outgoing Obama team, and he plans to release reports in the summer and fall, which could thrust the issues back into the spotlight as Election Day nears. Democrats argue that Johnson is misusing his position and running errands for the Republican National Committee, while Johnson claims they're afraid of the truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
