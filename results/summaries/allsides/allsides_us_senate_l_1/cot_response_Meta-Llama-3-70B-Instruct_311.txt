SUMMARY:
Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, as well as claims of Russian disinformation. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power and misusing Senate resources to boost Trump's political prospects, jeopardizing U.S. election security. Johnson insists he is a "nonpartisan guy" who is "concerned about this democracy" and wants to uncover the "truth". He claims his investigation has uncovered information showing the Trump administration was "sabotaged" by the Obama team. Democrats argue that Johnson's probe is a partisan effort to harm Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Johnson's actions have sparked concerns among Republicans, who worry that his efforts may backfire and distract from pressing issues like the coronavirus pandemic and police killings of unarmed African Americans. Johnson remains "tenacious" and "dedicated" to his investigation, asking Democrats what they are "afraid of" in the "truth" he hopes to reveal. END OF SUMMARY.
