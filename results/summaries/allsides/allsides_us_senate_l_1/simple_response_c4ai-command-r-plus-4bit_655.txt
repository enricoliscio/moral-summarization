SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is facing criticism from Democrats for his investigations into alleged corruption involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and the Obama administration's handling of the 2016 presidential transition. Johnson defends his actions as nonpartisan and necessary to ensure a peaceful transition of power, while Democrats accuse him of abusing his power and boosting President Trump's political prospects. Republicans are also worried that the investigations could backfire amid the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings. Johnson remains unfazed by the criticism and contends that Democrats are afraid of the truth. He plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, which Democrats argue will thrust the issues into the spotlight during the election season. The interaction between Johnson and Democratic Senator Brian Schatz highlights the partisan tensions surrounding these investigations, with Schatz accusing Johnson of misusing his position to run errands for the Republican National Committee. Johnson, however, dismisses these concerns and maintains that he is tenaciously dedicated to seeking the truth.
