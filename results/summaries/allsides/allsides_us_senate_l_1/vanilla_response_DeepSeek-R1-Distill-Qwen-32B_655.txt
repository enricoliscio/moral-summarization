Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Senator Ron Johnson and his investigations into Hunter Biden and the 2016 election. 

Johnson is a Republican Senator from Wisconsin. He's looking into Hunter Biden's role with Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. Democrats are accusing him of abusing his power to help Trump politically. Johnson says he's nonpartisan and just wants to find the truth. 

There's tension because Democrats think he's misusing resources, especially during a pandemic and racial unrest. Johnson claims his investigation shows the Obama administration sabotaged Trump's transition. He's releasing reports before the election, which Democrats see as a political move. 

He also released a list of Obama officials who unmasked Flynn's name, which the Trump campaign used against Biden. Democrats are upset, calling it a misuse of his position. Johnson dismisses their fears, saying Democrats are afraid of the truth. 

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. Focus on Johnson's investigations, the accusations from Democrats, his stance, and the political implications. Make sure to mention the key points: Burisma, Obama-Trump transition, Democrats' accusations, and the election timing.
