SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations against Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the Obama administration "sabotaged" the Trump transition. Johnson denies accusations of partisanship, saying he's a "straight shooter" seeking truth and reform. However, Democrats accuse him of abusing his power to boost Trump's political prospects and jeopardizing election security. They argue that Johnson's investigations are a misuse of his position, especially during a pandemic and social unrest. Johnson's probe has uncovered information that he claims shows the transition was "corrupted," and he plans to release reports in the summer and fall, which could impact the election. Democrats contend that Johnson is running errands for the Republican National Committee and is afraid to confront the truth. The investigation has created intense partisan tensions, with Johnson insisting he's not doing anyone's bidding and Democrats accusing him of operating a Russian disinformation front.
