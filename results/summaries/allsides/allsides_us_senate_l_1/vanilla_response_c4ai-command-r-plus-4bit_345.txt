SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is leading investigations into corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and alleged misconduct by the Obama administration during the 2016 presidential transition. Johnson claims these probes are nonpartisan efforts to uncover the truth and ensure a peaceful transition of power, but Democrats accuse him of abusing his power to boost President Trump's reelection bid. Republicans are reportedly worried that the investigations could backfire amid the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide protests against police brutality. Johnson defends his actions, arguing that Democrats are afraid of the truth, while Democrats criticize him for running errands for the Republican National Committee and misusing his position. Johnson plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, likely bringing the issues to the forefront of the election.
