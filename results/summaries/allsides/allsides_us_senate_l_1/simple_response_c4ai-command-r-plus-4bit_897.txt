SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is facing criticism from Democrats for his investigations into alleged corruption involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and the Obama administration's handling of the 2016 presidential transition. Johnson defends his actions as nonpartisan and claims he is seeking the truth to ensure a peaceful transition of power, but Democrats accuse him of abusing his power and boosting President Trump's political prospects. They point to his plans to release reports on the investigations during the election season and his past comments suggesting Joe Biden has not adequately addressed his son's business dealings. Johnson dismisses these concerns and contends that Democrats are afraid of the truth, insisting that his investigations are necessary to expose corruption during the presidential transition. Despite partisan tensions and criticism, Johnson remains committed to his investigations and challenges Democrats to explain their opposition to seeking the truth.
