SUMMARY:

Senator Ron Johnson is investigating corruption allegations involving Hunter Biden, son of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and claims that the Obama administration "sabotaged" the Trump transition. Democrats accuse Johnson of abusing his power to boost Trump's political prospects and operating a Russian disinformation front that jeopardizes U.S. election security. Johnson insists he's a "nonpartisan guy" who's only concerned about the truth and reforming the presidential transition process. However, Republicans are privately worried that the efforts to relitigate the Russia investigation and the events of 2016 could backfire, especially as the country deals with the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, and unrest over police killings. Democrats contend that Johnson's investigation is a political ploy to harm Joe Biden's campaign, and that he's releasing reports strategically to influence the election.

END OF SUMMARY.
