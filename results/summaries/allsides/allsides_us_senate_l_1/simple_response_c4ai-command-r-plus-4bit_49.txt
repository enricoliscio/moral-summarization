SUMMARY: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Ron Johnson is facing criticism from Democrats for his investigations into alleged corruption involving Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and the Obama administration's handling of the 2016 presidential transition. Johnson defends his actions as nonpartisan and claims he is seeking the truth to ensure a peaceful transition of power. However, Democrats accuse him of abusing his power and boosting President Trump's political prospects. They argue that Johnson's investigations are a misuse of his position and a distraction from more pressing issues such as the coronavirus pandemic and police brutality. Johnson maintains that he is tenacious and dedicated to getting information, while Democrats are afraid of the truth. The investigations have caused partisan tensions and harsh disputes in the Senate, with Republicans also expressing concern about the potential backlash. Johnson plans to release reports on his investigations this summer and fall, keeping the issues in the spotlight during the election season.
