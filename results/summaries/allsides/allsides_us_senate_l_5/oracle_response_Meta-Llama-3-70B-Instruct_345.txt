SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to ensure women don't face pay discrimination were blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences weren't based on gender. It would also allow women to sue for damages if they believed they were discriminated against. Democrats argued that women earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, while Republicans countered that the bill was politically inspired and would put a "tremendous burden" on employers through lawsuits. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead" of American women and families. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the issue. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "We will be back... for equal pay, for equal rights."
