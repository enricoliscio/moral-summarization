SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to pass a bill ensuring women don't face pay discrimination were blocked by Republicans, who claim the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, which aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove pay differences are related to job performance, not gender, and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats argue the bill would combat the pay gap, where women earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. Republicans, however, claim the bill is politically motivated and would lead to costly lawsuits. President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, emphasizing the importance of equal pay and equal rights. The moral framing of this issue is clear: standing up for women's rights and fair pay is a moral imperative, while blocking progress on this issue is a dereliction of duty.
