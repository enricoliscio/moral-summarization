Okay, I need to summarize the given news article. The user wants a concise summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." The article is about a bill related to pay discrimination, with Democrats and Republicans having opposing views.

First, I should identify the main points. The bill aims to close the gender pay gap, requiring employers to prove pay differences are job-related, allowing employees to discuss salaries, and enabling lawsuits for discrimination. Democrats argue it's necessary, while Republicans claim it's politically motivated, benefits trial lawyers, and burdens employers. The vote failed 52-0, with only Democrats supporting it. Obama criticized Republicans, and Reid accused them of ignoring the issue. Some Republicans, like Heller, proposed alternatives but were criticized as insufficient. Moderate Republicans also opposed the bill. The bill's sponsor, Mikulski, vows to bring it back.

I need to condense this into a coherent summary, ensuring all key points are included without exceeding 200 words. I'll structure it to first introduce the bill, then the opposing arguments, the vote outcome, and the future intentions.

Mike Enzi, argued the bill would burden employers with lawsuits and offered alternatives, but Democrats dismissed them as insufficient. Moderate Republicans like Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it excessive. Despite the defeat, the bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce it until it passes. END OF SUMMARY.
