Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the underlying values and perspectives presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a bill aimed at closing the gender pay gap, proposed by Democrats. Republicans are opposing it, arguing it benefits trial lawyers and burdens employers. The article also mentions political strategies and the reactions from both sides.

I need to capture the moral arguments from both parties. Democrats emphasize fairness and protecting women's rights, highlighting the pay gap. Republicans counter by saying the bill is politically motivated and could harm businesses, not truly benefit women.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the bill's purpose, the voting outcome, the arguments from both sides, and the future intentions of the Democrats. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll be concise but ensure all important aspects are covered.

I'll start by stating the bill's intent, then the opposition, the vote result, the political implications, and the ongoing commitment from Democrats. I'll make sure to include quotes or paraphrased statements that reflect the moral stances, like Obama's criticism and McConnell's view on trial lawyers.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning the Democrats' determination to bring the bill back, highlighting the ongoing debate. This should give a balanced summary that reflects the moral framing as presented in the original article.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at closing the gender pay gap and preventing discrimination was blocked in the Senate by Republicans, who argued it was politically motivated and would benefit trial lawyers over employers. The bill, which required employers to prove pay disparities were based on job performance and allowed women to sue for discrimination, fell short of the needed 60 votes, receiving only 52. President Obama criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused them of ignoring the issue. Democrats emphasized the bill's intent to address the pay gap, where women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. Republicans, however, claimed the bill would lead to costly lawsuits and harm businesses, with Sen. Mike Enzi calling it a "trial lawyers bonanza." Despite opposition, Democratic sponsor Sen. Barbara Mikulski vowed to reintroduce the bill until it passes. The debate highlighted partisan divisions over women's rights and workplace fairness. END OF SUMMARY.
