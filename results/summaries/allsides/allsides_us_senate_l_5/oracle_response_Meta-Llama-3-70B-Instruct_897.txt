SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to ensure women don't face pay discrimination were blocked by Republicans, who claim the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, which aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove pay differences are related to job performance, not gender, and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats accused Republicans of putting "partisan politics ahead" of American women and families, and of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the issue. Republicans argued the bill was the "wrong way" of dealing with the issue, and would lead to "huge class-action suits" that would burden employers. Despite the setback, Democrats vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, fighting for "equal pay" and "equal rights". The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, promised "we will be back" until the bill becomes law. END OF SUMMARY.
