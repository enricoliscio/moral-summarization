SUMMARY:

Democrats' election-year measure to ensure women don't face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, which needed 60 votes, got only 52, with no Republican support. The measure aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences weren't based on gender and allowing women to sue for damages. Democrats accused Republicans of putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Republicans argued they opposed pay discrimination but disagreed with the Democrats' bill, which they claimed was written without their input. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes. President Obama criticized Republicans for blocking the bill, saying they put "partisan politics ahead of American women and families."
