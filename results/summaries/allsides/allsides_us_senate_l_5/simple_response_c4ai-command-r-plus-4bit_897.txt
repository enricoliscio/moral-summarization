SUMMARY: An election-year bill aimed at ensuring women are not subjected to pay discrimination and closing loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act was blocked by Republicans, who argued that it would enrich trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill would require employers to justify pay differences based on performance rather than gender and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats framed the issue as a moral imperative to ensure equal pay for equal work, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accusing Republicans of ignoring the issue. Republicans countered that the bill was politically motivated and would burden employers with class-action lawsuits, with little benefit to women. Despite the defeat, the bill's sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for its passage. END OF SUMMARY.
