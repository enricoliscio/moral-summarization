SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to ensure women don't face pay discrimination were blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, aimed at closing loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove pay differences are related to job performance, not gender, and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats accused Republicans of putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families" and "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men. Republicans argued the bill would lead to "huge class-action suits" and "put a tremendous burden on employers through lawsuits." Democrats vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, with Sen. Barbara Mikulski saying "We will be back... for equal pay, for equal rights." The bill's supporters see it as a necessary step to combat pay discrimination, while opponents view it as an "overreach" that would benefit trial lawyers rather than women.
