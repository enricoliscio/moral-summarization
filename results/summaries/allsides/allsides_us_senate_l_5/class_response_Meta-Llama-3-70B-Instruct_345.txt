SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to ensure equal pay for women were blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The measure, designed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove pay differences are not based on gender and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats argued that the bill would prevent discrimination and ensure equal rights, while Republicans countered that it was a politically motivated "trial lawyers bonanza bill" that would put a "tremendous burden" on employers through lawsuits. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead" of American women and families, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused them of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the issue. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "We will be back" to fight for equal pay and equal rights.
