SUMMARY: An election-year bill designed to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work was blocked by Republicans who argued that the bill would primarily benefit trial lawyers, not women. Democrats countered that the bill would close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act and help combat gender-based pay discrimination. The bill's sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for the bill until it passes. This moral issue of fairness and justice for women in the workplace remains unresolved, with Democrats portraying Republicans as insensitive to women's issues and Republicans portraying Democrats as politically motivated and beholden to trial lawyers.

END OF SUMMARY.
