Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about a bill related to pay discrimination against women. Democrats are pushing for it, while Republicans are against it. The bill was blocked in the Senate because it didn't get enough votes. President Obama criticized Republicans, and there's some political maneuvering involved.

The bill aims to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act. It would require employers to prove pay differences are based on job performance, not gender, and prevent them from stopping employees from sharing salary info. It also allows women to sue for damages if they feel discriminated against.

Democrats think this will help women, who earn 77 cents for every dollar men make. They expected to gain politically with this move. Republicans argue it's politically motivated and benefits trial lawyers, not women. They believe it's too harsh on employers and allows too many lawsuits.

Some Republicans, like Dean Heller, suggested alternative bills, but Democrats dismissed them. Moderate Republicans, like Olympia Snowe, also opposed the bill, saying it goes too far. The bill's sponsor, Barbara Mikulski, vows to bring it back until it passes.

So, the summary should include the key points: the bill's purpose, the vote outcome, the arguments from both sides, and the sponsor's commitment. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main arguments and outcomes without getting too detailed.

I'll start by stating the bill's purpose, then the vote result, followed by the Democrats' stance and the Republicans' counterarguments. Finally, mention the sponsor's determination to reintroduce the bill.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination was blocked in the Senate, with only 52 votes in favor, none from Republicans. The measure, which would require employers to prove pay disparities are job-performance related and allow women to sue for discrimination, was criticized by Republicans as politically motivated and harmful to employers. Democrats argued it would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act and help reduce the gender pay gap, where women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, accused the bill of benefiting trial lawyers and enabling excessive lawsuits. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it an overreach. Despite the setback, the bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce it until it passes. END OF SUMMARY.
