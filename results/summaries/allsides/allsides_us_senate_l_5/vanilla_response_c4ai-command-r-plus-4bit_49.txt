SUMMARY: An election-year bill aimed at ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work was blocked by Republicans in the Senate, with the motion failing to receive the necessary 60 votes. The bill, supported by Democrats and President Obama, was designed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act and address the longstanding issue of the gender pay gap, with women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. Democrats argued that the bill would prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information and allow women to sue for damages in cases of discrimination. However, Republicans criticized the bill as politically motivated and claimed it would primarily benefit trial lawyers at the expense of employers. Despite the defeat, the bill's sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay and rights for women.
