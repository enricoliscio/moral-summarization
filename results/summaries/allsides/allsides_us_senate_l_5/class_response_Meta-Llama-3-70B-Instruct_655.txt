SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to ensure equal pay for women were blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, designed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove pay differences are related to job performance, not gender, and allow women to sue for damages. Republicans, accused of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the issue, argued the bill was politically inspired and would lead to "huge class-action suits" that would "put a tremendous burden on employers." Democrats countered that the bill would prevent "discrimination" and ensure women are not "forbidden" from sharing salary information. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "we are not giving up for equal pay, for equal rights."
