SUMMARY: Democrats and Republicans face off over a bill to ensure women don't face pay discrimination. The bill was blocked by Republicans who argued that it would reward trial lawyers, despite Democrats' claims that it would close loops in the Equal Pay Act and prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information. The bill's sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, stating that Democrats are not giving up on equal pay and equal rights. Republicans remained largely silent about the issue, with only a few speaking against the bill and accusing Democrats of playing partisan politics. The motion failed to get the required 60 votes, with 52 votes in favor, all from Democrats.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of wanting to ignore the issue of pay discrimination, while President Obama criticized them for putting partisan politics ahead of American women and families. The bill was opposed by some Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell and Mike Enzi, who called it a "trial lawyers' bonanza bill" that would burden employers with class-action lawsuits. 

The debate highlights the moral framing of discrimination, putting politics ahead of equality, and the perceived overreach of the bill, with Republicans arguing it is an attempt to reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. 

END OF SUMMARY.
