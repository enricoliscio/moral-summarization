SUMMARY: An election-year bill designed to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued that it would burden employers with lawsuits and benefit trial lawyers. The bill, backed by Democrats and President Obama, would have required employers to prove that differences in pay were related to job performance and not gender. It would also allow women who faced discrimination to sue for damages and prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information. Despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill failed to pass with only 52 votes, short of the required 60. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the bill's sponsor, criticized Republicans for blocking the bill, accusing them of being insensitive to the issue of pay discrimination. Republicans countered that the bill was politically motivated and would not effectively address the issue of the pay gap between men and women. One Republican senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, proposed an alternative bill, but it was deemed insufficient by Democrats. Despite the setback, Mikulski vowed to continue fighting for equal pay legislation.
END OF SUMMARY.
