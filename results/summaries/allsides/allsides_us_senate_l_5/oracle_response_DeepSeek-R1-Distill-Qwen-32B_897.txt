Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a bill in the Senate aimed at addressing pay discrimination against women. Democrats support it, saying it would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act. Republicans oppose it, arguing it's politically motivated and benefits trial lawyers instead of employers.

The author used words like "discrimination," "ahead," "stick," "less," "stand," "wrong," "dealing," "politics," "nothing," "allows," "overreach," "addressing," "goes," "burden," "back," "giving," "pay," "rights." I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The bill requires employers to prove pay differences are based on performance, not gender, and allows women to sue for discrimination. Democrats believe it helps women, who earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. Republicans say it's a political move, benefits lawyers, and burdens employers with lawsuits.

The vote failed with only 52 out of needed 60, no Republicans supporting. Obama criticized Republicans, and Reid accused them of ignoring the issue. Some Republicans, like Heller, proposed alternatives but were criticized. Moderate Snowe called the bill an overreach. Democrats vow to reintroduce it.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points and the moral words. Make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and flows naturally.

SUMMARY:  
A Democratic bill aimed at combating pay discrimination against women was blocked in the Senate, with Republicans arguing it was politically motivated and would benefit trial lawyers over employers. The bill, which failed to reach the required 60 votes, sought to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay disparities were based on job performance, not gender, and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Democrats emphasized the gender pay gap, stating women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn, while Republicans criticized the measure as a "trial lawyers' bonanza" and an overreach that would burden employers with costly lawsuits. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue, while President Obama criticized them for prioritizing politics over women's rights. Republicans, including Sen. Dean Heller, proposed alternatives but were dismissed by Democrats. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe called the bill "regrettable," arguing it went too far. Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce the measure until it passes, insisting they would not give up on equal pay and rights. END OF SUMMARY.
