SUMMARY:

Democrats' election-year measure to ensure equal pay for women was blocked by Republicans in the Senate, with only 52 votes out of the needed 60. The bill aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences were not based on gender and allowing women to sue for damages. Republicans argued the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense, while Democrats claimed it would help women who earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid vowed to bring the measure back until it passes. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, also promised to return to the bill until it becomes law.

END OF SUMMARY.
