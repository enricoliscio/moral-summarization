SUMMARY: Republicans blocked an election-year Democratic bill designed to ensure that women don't face pay discrimination, arguing that the bill would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, which needed 60 votes to pass, received only 52, with no support from Republicans. The bill would have closed loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove that pay differences were related to job performance, not gender, and by preventing employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information. It also would have allowed women who faced discrimination to sue for damages. Democrats acknowledged that they expected to make political gains with women by pressing to close the pay gap, which they said has women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. Republicans countered that they oppose pay discrimination but disagree with the bill, which they called a "trial lawyers' bonanza" that would burden employers with class-action lawsuits. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, stating that Democrats are "not giving up for equal pay, for equal rights."
END OF SUMMARY.
