Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about a bill related to pay discrimination between men and women. The author used specific morally charged words like discrimination, politics, burden, etc., which I need to include in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Democrats introduced a bill to address pay discrimination, but Republicans blocked it. The bill aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences were job-related and not based on gender, and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Democrats argue it's about fairness, while Republicans claim it's politically motivated, benefiting trial lawyers and burdening employers.

I need to include the moral words: discrimination, politics, burden, etc. I'll structure the summary to show the conflict between Democrats and Republicans, highlighting their arguments using these terms. I'll mention the vote count, President Obama's criticism, and the reactions from both sides. Also, note that the bill was blocked but Democrats plan to reintroduce it.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing. Let me draft this, making sure to include all key points and the specified words.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who accused it of being politically motivated and benefiting trial lawyers at employers' expense. The measure, which failed to gain the needed 60 votes, sought to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay differences were job-related and not gender-based, and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Democrats criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights, while Republicans argued the bill was an overreach that would burden employers with costly lawsuits. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue, while Sen. Mitch McConnell called the bill a "trial lawyers bonanza." Despite the defeat, the bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce it until it passes. END OF SUMMARY.
