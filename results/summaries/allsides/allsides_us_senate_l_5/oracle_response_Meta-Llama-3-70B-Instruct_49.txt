SUMMARY:

Democrats pushed for a bill to ensure women don't face pay discrimination, but Republicans blocked it, citing it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the issue of women being paid less than men. The bill would require employers to prove pay differences are related to job performance, not gender, and allow women to sue for damages. Republicans argued they oppose pay discrimination, but disagree with the Democrats' bill, which they claim is the "wrong way of dealing with this issue." They called it a "trial lawyers bonanza bill" that would put a "tremendous burden on employers" through lawsuits. Democrats vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, standing up for "equal pay, for equal rights." The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, promised, "We will be back."
