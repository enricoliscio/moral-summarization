Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about a bill in the Senate aimed at addressing pay discrimination against women. Democrats are pushing for it, while Republicans are opposing it. The key moral words here are discrimination, politics, overreach, burden, etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should note the main points: the bill's purpose, the Republican opposition, the vote outcome, President Obama's criticism, the specifics of the bill, the political strategy by Democrats, Republican arguments, and the Democrats' vow to reintroduce the bill.

I need to structure the summary concisely, making sure to include the moral framing. Let me outline the summary:

1. Introduction: Bill blocked by Republicans, aimed at preventing pay discrimination.
2. Vote details: 52-0, criticism from Obama and Reid.
3. Bill's provisions: Employers must prove pay differences are job-related, allow salary discussions, enable lawsuits.
4. Political strategy: Democrats targeting women voters, Republicans' fears of being seen as insensitive.
5. Republican arguments: Trial lawyers' gain, overreach, burden on employers.
6. Conclusion: Democrats vow to reintroduce the bill.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the moral words. I'll check each sentence to see if it incorporates the necessary terms without making it sound forced.

I should also make sure the summary flows well and accurately represents both sides. Let me put it all together, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at preventing pay discrimination against women was blocked in the Senate by Republicans, who accused it of being politically motivated and benefiting trial lawyers at employers' expense. The measure, which failed to reach the required 60 votes, would have closed loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay differences were job-related, allowing employees to discuss salaries, and enabling women to sue for discrimination. Democrats criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights, while Republicans argued the bill overreached and unfairly burdened employers with costly lawsuits. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue, while President Obama condemned their "partisan politics." Republicans, including Sen. Mike Enzi, called the bill a "trial lawyers' bonanza," claiming it would do little for women but harm businesses. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it "regrettable." Despite the loss, Democratic sponsor Sen. Barbara Mikulski vowed to reintroduce the measure until it passes. END OF SUMMARY.
