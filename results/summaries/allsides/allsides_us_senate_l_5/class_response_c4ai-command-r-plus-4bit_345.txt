SUMMARY: An election-year Democratic bill designed to ensure women do not face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans who criticized it as politically motivated and beneficial to trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, which aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, required employers to justify pay differences based on performance rather than gender and prohibited them from forbidding employees from sharing salary information. It also allowed women to sue for damages if they faced discrimination. Despite the Democrats' acknowledgment of the expected political gains with women, Republicans remained largely silent about the issue, with only one senator speaking against the bill, citing it as a reward for trial lawyers. The bill sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay and rights for women, promising to bring the measure back until it passes. President Obama criticized Republicans for prioritizing partisan politics over American women and families.
END OF SUMMARY.
