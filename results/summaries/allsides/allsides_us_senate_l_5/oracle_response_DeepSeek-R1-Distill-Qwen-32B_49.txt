Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a bill in the Senate aimed at ensuring equal pay for women, blocked by Republicans. Democrats argue it's to prevent pay discrimination, while Republicans say it rewards trial lawyers and burdens employers.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the bill's purpose, the opposing views, the vote result, and the reactions from both parties. I need to include the moral terms like "discrimination," "ahead," "wrong," "burden," etc.

I'll structure the summary to first state what the bill aims to do, then the Republican opposition, the vote outcome, and the aftermath. I should mention the criticism from Obama and Reid, the Republican counterarguments, and the Democrats' vow to reintroduce the bill.

I need to make sure each sentence includes some of the moral terms without making it forced. For example, using "discrimination," "ahead," "wrong," "burden," and "back" where appropriate.

I'll also keep an eye on the word count, aiming for under 200 words. Let me draft the summary, then check for the inclusion of the moral terms and the flow.

Wait, I should also ensure that the summary is concise but covers all main points: the bill's goals, the Republican opposition, the vote result, the political implications, and the commitment to reintroduce the bill.

I think I've covered all the necessary parts. Now, I'll make sure the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral terms as possible without sounding unnatural.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at closing the gender pay gap and preventing discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who argued it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The measure, which failed to reach the needed 60 votes, would require employers to prove pay differences were job-performance related, prohibit salary secrecy, and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights, while Republicans accused the bill of being politically motivated and overly burdensome. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue, while President Obama condemned them for putting "partisan politics ahead" of women and families. Republicans, including Sen. Mike Enzi, criticized the bill as a "trial lawyers bonanza" that would enable costly class-action lawsuits. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe called the bill an "overreach." Despite the loss, Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to return and push for the bill until it passes, emphasizing their commitment to equal pay and rights. END OF SUMMARY.
