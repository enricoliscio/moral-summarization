Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Democrats' bill on pay discrimination. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article talks about a bill proposed by Democrats to ensure women don't face pay discrimination. Republicans are against it, arguing it benefits trial lawyers over employers. The bill was blocked in the Senate with only 52 votes, none from Republicans. President Obama criticized the Republicans, and Harry Reid accused them of ignoring the issue.

The bill aims to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act. It requires employers to prove pay differences are job-related, allows employees to share salary info, and lets women sue for discrimination. Democrats think this will help women, who earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. They expected political gains by pushing this issue.

Republicans say they oppose the bill because it's politically motivated and not collaborative. They argue it's a boon for trial lawyers and would lead to more lawsuits against employers. Some Republican senators, like Mike Enzi, criticized the bill as a "trial lawyers bonanza." Even moderate Republicans like Olympia Snowe opposed it, calling it overreach.

Despite the loss, the bill's sponsor, Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring it back until it passes.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the bill's purpose and the opposing views. Then mention the vote outcome, the reactions from Obama and Reid, the bill's provisions, the Democrats' goals, Republican criticisms, and the sponsor's determination.

I should ensure clarity and conciseness, making sure to include all key elements without going over the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination was blocked in the Senate by Republicans, who argued it would favor trial lawyers over employers. The measure, which failed to reach the required 60 votes, would have closed loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to justify pay disparities and allowing employees to share salary information. Democrats, including President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over gender equality. Republicans, however, accused the bill of being politically motivated and overly burdensome to employers, with some calling it a "trial lawyers bonanza." Despite the setback, the bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce it until it passes. END OF SUMMARY.
