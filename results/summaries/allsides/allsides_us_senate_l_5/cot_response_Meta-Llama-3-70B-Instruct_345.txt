SUMMARY:
Democrats' efforts to pass a bill ensuring equal pay for women were blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men. The bill aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences were related to job performance, not gender. Republicans argued they oppose pay discrimination but disagree with the Democrats' bill, which they claimed was written without their input. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "We will be back... for equal pay, for equal rights."
