SUMMARY:

In a partisan showdown, Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic bill aimed at ensuring women don't face pay discrimination, claiming it would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, which needed 60 votes to pass, fell short with only 52 votes, none from Republicans. Democrats argue the bill would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences are based on job performance, not gender. They also claim women earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. Republicans, however, say the bill is politically motivated and would lead to costly lawsuits for employers. President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "We will be back... for equal pay, for equal rights."
