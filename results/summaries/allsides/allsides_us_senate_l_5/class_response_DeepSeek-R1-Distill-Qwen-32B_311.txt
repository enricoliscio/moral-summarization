Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I should include as many as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about a bill related to pay discrimination against women. Democrats are pushing it, while Republicans are blocking it. The bill aims to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay differences are based on job performance, not gender, and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Republicans argue it's politically motivated, benefits trial lawyers, and burdens employers. They also mention it's an overreach.

Now, I need to highlight the moral framing. The author uses words like discrimination, politics, overreach, burden, etc. I should make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by stating that a bill to prevent pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans. Mention the vote count and the accusations from both sides. Include President Obama's criticism about putting politics ahead. Then, outline what the bill does: require employers to prove pay differences, allow lawsuits, and close Equal Pay Act loopholes. Note the Democrats' goals and Republicans' counterarguments about rewarding lawyers and overburdening employers. Also, mention the Republicans' alternative bill and their criticism of the Democrats' approach. Finally, note the Democrats' determination to pass the bill despite the setback.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure all the key moral points are covered. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each paragraph flows logically and includes the necessary moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
A bill aimed at preventing pay discrimination against women was blocked by Republicans in the Senate, with only 52 votes in favor, none from the GOP. Democrats argued the measure would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences were tied to job performance and allowing women to sue for discrimination. They criticized Republicans for prioritizing "partisan politics" over women's rights. Republicans countered that the bill would "reward trial lawyers" and "burden" employers with costly lawsuits, calling it an "overreach." Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed it as a "trial lawyers' bonanza," while Sen. Mike Enzi claimed it would do little for women and instead enable "huge class-action suits." Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, labeling it "regrettable." Despite the setback, the bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to "return until it passes," emphasizing Democrats' commitment to "equal pay and equal rights." END OF SUMMARY.
