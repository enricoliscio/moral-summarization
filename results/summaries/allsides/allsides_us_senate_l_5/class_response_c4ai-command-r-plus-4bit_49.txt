SUMMARY: An election-year bill designed to ensure women don't face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans who prioritized partisan politics over the rights of American women and families. The bill, which aimed to close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act, was opposed by Republicans who argued it would burden employers with lawsuits and reward trial lawyers. Democrats, led by President Obama, pushed for the legislation, criticizing Republicans for wanting to stick their heads in the sand about the issue of the longstanding pay gap, with women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. The bill would have required employers to justify pay differences based on job performance, not gender, and would have prevented employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information. Despite the bill's defeat, Democrats, led by sponsor Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue the fight for equal pay and equal rights for women.
END OF SUMMARY.
