Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify all the morally framed words as per the user's instruction.

Looking at the text, the key morally charged words include "discrimination," "reward," "expense," "blocked," "partisan," "ahead," "American women and families," "stick their heads in the sand," "longstanding issue," "insensitive," "alternative," "insufficient," "wrong way," "trial lawyers bonanza," "overreach," "burden," "suits," "class-action," "giving up," and "equal rights."

Now, I need to craft a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes these terms, maintaining the original moral perspective. The summary should highlight the conflict between Democrats and Republicans over the pay equity bill, the arguments each side presents, and the implications of the vote.

I'll start by stating that the bill was blocked, then outline the Democrats' stance on discrimination and the measures the bill would implement. Next, I'll present the Republicans' counterarguments about rewarding trial lawyers and the political motivations. I'll include the reactions from key figures like Obama, Reid, and McConnell, as well as the vow from Mikulski to reintroduce the bill.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically and includes all the morally framed words without making it too verbose. I'll also make sure to end with Mikulski's commitment, emphasizing the ongoing struggle for equal pay.

Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**
A Democratic bill aimed at combating gender-based pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who argued it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. Democrats claimed the bill would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences were job-performance related and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Republicans criticized the measure as politically motivated, calling it a "trial lawyers bonanza" and an "overreach." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue, while President Obama condemned their "partisan politics." Only one Republican, Dean Heller, proposed an alternative, which Democrats deemed insufficient. Moderate Republican Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it a "tremendous burden" on employers. Despite the loss, Democratic sponsor Barbara Mikulski vowed to reintroduce the bill until it passes, emphasizing the fight for equal pay and rights. END OF SUMMARY.
