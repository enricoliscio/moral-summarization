SUMMARY: An election-year bill designed to ensure that women don't face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who criticized it as a partisan move that would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, which would have closed loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, required employers to prove that pay differences were related to job performance, not gender, and would have prevented employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information. It also would have allowed women who faced discrimination to sue for damages. Democrats argued that the bill was necessary to address the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men, with women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. However, Republicans, including Sen. Mitch McConnell and Sen. Mike Enzi, characterized the bill as a boon for trial lawyers and an "overreach" that would burden employers with class-action lawsuits. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay and equal rights for women, despite the defeat.
