SUMMARY: An election-year bill designed to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. The bill, supported by Democrats and President Obama, aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove that pay differences are related to job performance and not gender, allowing employees to share salary information, and enabling women to sue for damages if they faced discrimination. Despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill failed to pass with only 52 votes, as Republicans argued that it would primarily benefit trial lawyers and burden employers with class-action lawsuits. The bill's sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay until the legislation passes.
END OF SUMMARY.
