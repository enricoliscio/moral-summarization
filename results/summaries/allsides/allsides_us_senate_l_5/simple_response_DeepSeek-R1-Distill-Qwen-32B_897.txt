Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, making sure to keep the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about a bill in the Senate regarding equal pay for women. Democrats are pushing it, saying it's to prevent pay discrimination. They mention it would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, require employers to justify pay differences based on job performance, allow employees to share salary info, and let women sue for discrimination. They argue that women earn 77 cents for every dollar men make, so this bill is crucial.

On the other hand, Republicans are against it. They say it's politically motivated and benefits trial lawyers at the expense of employers. They claim it's unnecessary because they already oppose pay discrimination but don't agree with the Democrats' approach. Some Republicans, like Sen. Mike Enzi, argue it's more about rewarding lawyers than helping women, leading to more lawsuits and class actions which would burden employers.

The bill didn't pass because it needed 60 votes and only got 52, with no Republicans supporting it. President Obama criticized the Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue. The Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, are determined to bring the bill back until it passes.

So, the moral framing here is that Democrats are fighting for gender equality and fairness, while Republicans are seen as obstructionists who prioritize corporate interests over women's rights. The Democrats are portrayed as champions for equal pay, while Republicans are accused of using political tactics to block progress.

I need to capture this in a concise summary, highlighting the moral perspectives of both sides. I should mention the key points: the bill's goals, the Republican opposition, the vote outcome, the political implications, and the commitment from Democrats to continue pushing the bill.

I should structure it to first present the Democrats' stance and their moral argument, then contrast it with the Republicans' counterarguments and their moral framing. Finally, note the outcome and the ongoing commitment from Democrats.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all essential elements without getting too detailed.

Democrats highlighted the 77-cent-to-a-dollar wage gap, while Republicans criticized it as politically motivated and burdensome to employers, leading to more litigation. President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of prioritizing politics over women's rights. Republicans, including Sen.
