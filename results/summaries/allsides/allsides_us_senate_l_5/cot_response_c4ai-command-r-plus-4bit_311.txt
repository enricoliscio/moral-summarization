SUMMARY: An election-year bill by the Democrats that aimed to *ensure* women do not face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans. The latter *complained* that the bill would reward trial lawyers over employers. The bill's sponsor, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, *accused* Republicans of ignoring the *longstanding* issue of women being paid less than men. The bill would have *required* employers to prove that differences in pay were related to job performance and not gender, and would have *forbidden* employers from *forbidding* employees from sharing salary information. It would also allow women who *believed* they were discriminated against to sue for damages. Democrats *acknowledged* they expected to make political gains with women by *pressing* to close the pay gap, with women *earning* just 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. Republicans, *fearful* of being *portrayed* as insensitive to women, *opposed* the bill, *disagreeing* with its content and the fact that it was written without their input. The bill's sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, *criticized* the Republicans' stance, *calling* their refusal to support the bill a "regrettable overreach" that would put a *burden* on employers through class-action lawsuits. Mikulski *vowed* to *return* with the bill until it passes, *giving* women the *equal* rights they deserve.
