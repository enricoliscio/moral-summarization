SUMMARY:
Democrats' election-year measure to ensure women don't face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill was "politically inspired" and would "reward trial lawyers at employers' expense". President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families". Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men. Republicans argued that they oppose pay discrimination but disagree with the Democrats' bill, which they said would lead to "huge class-action suits with very little defense by any employer". The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "We will be back... for equal pay, for equal rights".
