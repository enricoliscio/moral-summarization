SUMMARY: An election-year bill designed to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued that it would burden employers with lawsuits and benefit trial lawyers. The bill, backed by Democrats and President Obama, aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove that pay differences are related to job performance, not gender. It would also allow women to sue for damages if they faced discrimination. Despite the Democratic push, the bill failed to reach the 60 votes needed to pass, with Republicans criticizing it as politically motivated and insufficiently addressing the issue. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the bill's chief sponsor, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay.
