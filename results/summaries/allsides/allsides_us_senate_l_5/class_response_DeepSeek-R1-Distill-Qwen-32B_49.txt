Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and identify where these words are used.

The article is about a bill proposed by Democrats to address pay discrimination against women. Republicans are opposing it, arguing it benefits trial lawyers and burdens employers. The author uses words like discrimination, politics, overreach, burden, etc.

I should start by outlining the main points: the bill's purpose, the Republican opposition, the political implications, and the reactions from both sides. I need to make sure to include the morally charged words without making the summary too long.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the bill and its goals, then the Republican counterarguments, followed by the political dynamics and the ongoing commitment from Democrats. I'll weave in the moral terms as they come up in the narrative.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so each sentence should cover a key point without unnecessary details. Also, I should maintain the original tone and ensure that the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the required words and keep it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to see if it effectively conveys the moral perspective while staying factual.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at combating pay discrimination against women was blocked by Republicans, who argued it would benefit trial lawyers at employers' expense. The measure, which failed to reach the required 60 votes, sought to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay differences were job-performance related and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Democrats criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights, while Republicans accused the bill of being politically motivated and overly broad. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called it a "trial lawyers' bonanza," and Sen. Mike Enzi dismissed it as having little benefit for women. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it an "overreach" that would impose a "tremendous burden" on employers. Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce the measure until it passes, emphasizing their commitment to equal pay and rights. END OF SUMMARY.
