SUMMARY:

The US Senate blocked a Democratic measure aimed at ensuring women don't face pay discrimination, with Republicans arguing it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, which needed 60 votes, got only 52, with no Republican support. Democrats claimed the bill would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences aren't gender-based and allowing women to sue for damages. Republicans countered that the bill was politically motivated and would lead to costly lawsuits. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue of women being paid less than men. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes. The debate highlights the partisan divide on the issue, with Democrats pushing to close the pay gap and Republicans opposing the proposed legislation.

END OF SUMMARY.
