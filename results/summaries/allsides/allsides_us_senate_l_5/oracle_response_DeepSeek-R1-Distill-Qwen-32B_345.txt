Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a bill related to pay discrimination between men and women. Democrats are pushing it, Republicans are against it. The article mentions specific moral words like discrimination, politics, burden, etc.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the bill's purpose, the opposing arguments from both parties, the voting outcome, and the reactions from leaders. I need to include the moral words as much as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll structure the summary to first state what the bill aims to do, then mention the Republican opposition, the voting result, and the reactions from both sides. I'll make sure to use words like 'discrimination,' 'politics,' 'burden,' 'overreach,' and 'rights.'

I should also note the Democrats' strategy to gain political support and the Republicans' counterarguments about the bill benefiting trial lawyers. Including quotes from key figures like Obama, Reid, and McConnell will add depth and maintain the moral tone.

Finally, I'll conclude with the Democrats' vow to continue pushing for the bill, emphasizing their commitment to equal pay and rights. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit while ensuring all critical points are covered.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who argued it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. The measure, which failed to gain the needed 60 votes, sought to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay disparities were job-performance related and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Democrats criticized Republicans for prioritizing partisan politics over women's rights, with President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accusing them of ignoring the issue. Republicans, including Sen. Mike Enzi, countered that the bill was politically motivated and would burden employers with costly class-action lawsuits. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it an "overreach." Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce the measure until it passes, emphasizing their commitment to equal pay and rights. END OF SUMMARY.
