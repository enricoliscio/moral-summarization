SUMMARY:
Democrats' election-year measure to ensure women don't face pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who claimed the bill was politically inspired and would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men. Democrats argued that the bill would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, while Republicans claimed it was the "wrong" way to address the issue and would lead to "regrettable" lawsuits. Despite the setback, Sen. Barbara Mikulski vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, fighting for "equal pay" and "equal rights." END OF SUMMARY.
