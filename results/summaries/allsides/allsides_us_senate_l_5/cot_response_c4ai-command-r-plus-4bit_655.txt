SUMMARY: An election-year bill backed by Democrats and designed to *ensure* that women are shielded from pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who *complained* that the bill would benefit trial lawyers at employers' expense. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, standing alongside pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter, *accused* Republicans of ignoring the issue of gender pay inequality. Republicans, in turn, *opposed* the bill, arguing that it would do little to help women and would instead enrich trial lawyers. President Obama *criticized* Republicans for prioritizing politics over the well-being of American women and families. Democrats privately acknowledged their expectation to gain political favor with women by pushing for the bill. However, Republicans remained largely silent on the issue, with only a handful speaking out against the bill, including Senator Mitch McConnell, who *criticized* it as a boon for trial lawyers, and Senator Mike Enzi, who called it "politics." The lone Republican to speak on the floor against the bill was Senator Dean Heller, who proposed an alternative approach. Despite the setback, Senator Barbara Mikulski, the chief sponsor, *vowed* to continue fighting for equal pay and equal rights for women.
END OF SUMMARY.
