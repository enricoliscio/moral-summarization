SUMMARY: A Democratic bill designed to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work was blocked by Republicans in the Senate, with a vote of 52-48. The bill aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove that pay differences are related to job performance and not gender, preventing employers from forbidding salary discussions among employees, and allowing women to sue for damages in cases of discrimination. Republicans argued that the bill would unfairly benefit trial lawyers at the expense of employers and was politically motivated. Democrats, including President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, criticized Republicans for opposing the bill and not addressing the issue of pay discrimination. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue pushing for the legislation until it passes.
END OF SUMMARY.
