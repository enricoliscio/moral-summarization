SUMMARY:

In a move that has sparked outrage, Republicans blocked a Democratic measure aimed at ensuring women don't face pay discrimination. The bill, which needed 60 votes to succeed, got only 52, with not a single Republican supporting it. The measure would have required employers to prove that pay differences were related to job performance, not gender, and allowed women to sue for damages if they believed they were discriminated against. Republicans claimed the bill would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers, while Democrats argued it would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act. President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "We will be back... for equal pay, for equal rights."
