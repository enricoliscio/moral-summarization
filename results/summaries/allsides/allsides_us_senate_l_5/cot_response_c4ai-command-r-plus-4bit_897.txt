SUMMARY: Democrats stated that the bill would ensure that women do not face pay discrimination. Republicans countered by claiming that the bill would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill sponsors vowed to bring the bill back until it passes. 

In the lead-up to the vote, Democrats, led by the President, made an all-out push for the legislation, while Republicans remained largely silent. The bill was designed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act and to ensure that women are not discriminated against in the workplace. It would require employers to prove that differences in pay were related to job performance and not gender, and would prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information. 

Republicans, fearing that Democrats would portray them as insensitive to women, argued that they oppose pay discrimination but disagreed with the specifics of the bill, which they believed would burden employers with lawsuits and reward trial lawyers. They also accused Democrats of engaging in partisan politics, putting politics ahead of American women and families. 

Despite the efforts of Democrats and the President, the bill was blocked by Republicans and failed to pass, with only 52 votes in favor. The sponsor of the bill, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay and equal rights for women. 

END OF SUMMARY.
