SUMMARY: An election-year measure aimed at ensuring women are not victims of pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans, who argued that it would enrich trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, backed by Democrats, would have required employers to justify pay differences based on performance rather than gender and would have allowed women to sue for damages if they believed they were discriminated against. While Democrats framed the bill as a necessary update to the 1963 Equal Pay Act to address the persistent pay gap, Republicans criticized it as a political maneuver that would burden employers with class-action lawsuits. Despite the defeat, the sponsor of the bill, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for pay equity until the legislation passes.
END OF SUMMARY.
