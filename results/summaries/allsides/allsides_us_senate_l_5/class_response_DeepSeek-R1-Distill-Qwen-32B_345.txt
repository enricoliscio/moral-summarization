Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the context.

The article is about a bill in the Senate regarding equal pay for women. Democrats introduced the bill to prevent pay discrimination, while Republicans blocked it, arguing it's politically motivated and benefits trial lawyers. The bill failed to get the needed 60 votes.

The user wants a summary that includes the morally framed words: discrimination, ahead, wanting, stick, forbidding, discriminated, politics, overreach, put, burden. I need to make sure these words are included as much as possible.

First, I'll identify the key points. The bill aims to close the pay gap, requiring employers to prove pay differences are based on performance, not gender, and allowing employees to share salary info. It also allows lawsuits for discrimination. Republicans oppose it, saying it's about politics and benefits lawyers, not women. They believe it's an overreach and puts a burden on employers through class-action lawsuits.

I should structure the summary to include both parties' arguments, using the moral words. Start with the Democrats' stance on discrimination, then Republicans' counterpoints about politics and burden. Mention the vote outcome and the sponsors' vows.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring the moral terms are included naturally. Maybe start with the bill's purpose, then the opposition, the vote result, and the commitment to reintroduce the bill.

Let me check if all the moral words are used: discrimination, ahead (Republicans put politics ahead), wanting (accused of wanting to ignore the issue), stick (they stick their heads in the sand), forbidding (the bill prevents employers from forbidding salary sharing), discriminated (women who feel discriminated can sue), politics (accused of putting politics ahead), overreach (called it overreach), put (puts burden), burden (burden on employers).

I think that covers most of them. Now, let me write the summary concisely, making sure it flows well and includes all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. The measure, which failed to gain the required 60 votes, sought to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay differences were tied to job performance and not gender, while also allowing employees to share salary information and enabling women to sue for discrimination. Democrats argued the bill would protect women from earning just 77 cents for every dollar men earn, accusing Republicans of putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Republicans countered that the bill was politically motivated, benefiting trial lawyers at employers' expense, and called it an "overreach" that would "put a tremendous burden" on businesses through class-action lawsuits. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid vowed to reintroduce the bill until it passes, emphasizing Democrats' commitment to equal pay. Republicans, including Sen. Mike Enzi, criticized the bill as a "trial lawyers' bonanza" with little benefit for women. The vote highlighted deep partisan divides over addressing pay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
