SUMMARY: Democrats and Republicans face off over a bill designed to ensure women don't face pay discrimination. Republicans blocked the bill, arguing that it would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. Democrats, including President Obama, criticized Republicans for putting partisan politics ahead of American women and families, while Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the issue and not engaging with them in good faith to find a solution. The bill, which Democrats said would close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act, would require employers to justify pay differences based on performance rather than gender and would protect employees' right to discuss salary information. Despite the setback, the sponsor of the bill, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay and equal rights for women.

END OF SUMMARY.
