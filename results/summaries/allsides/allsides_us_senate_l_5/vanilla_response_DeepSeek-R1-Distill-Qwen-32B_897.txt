Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a bill related to equal pay for women. Democrats are pushing it, but Republicans are against it. The bill failed in the Senate because it didn't get enough votes. 

First, I need to identify the main points. The bill aims to close the pay gap between men and women, which Democrats say is 77 cents on the dollar. It would require employers to prove pay differences are based on job performance, not gender, and allow employees to discuss salaries. It also lets women sue for discrimination. 

On the other side, Republicans argue the bill is politically motivated, benefits trial lawyers, and burdens employers with lawsuits. They mention it was written without their input. Some Republicans, like Dean Heller, offered alternatives but were criticized by Democrats. Moderate Republican Olympia Snowe also opposed it, calling it an overreach.

President Obama criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights. Democrats plan to bring the bill back, showing their commitment to the issue. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention both parties' stances, the bill's provisions, the vote outcome, and the reactions from key figures. Also, note the political implications and future plans.

Let me structure it: start with the bill's purpose, the vote result, Democrats' goals, Republicans' criticisms, key quotes, and the plan to reintroduce the bill. Keep it concise but cover all main points without getting too detailed.

I should make sure to include that the bill failed 52-0 among Republicans, the 77 cents statistic, the provisions, and the Republican concerns about lawsuits and trial lawyers. Also, mention the political strategy and the ongoing commitment from Democrats.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
A Democratic bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination was blocked in the Senate by Republicans, who accused it of being politically motivated and favoring trial lawyers over employers. The bill, which failed to reach the required 60 votes, would have closed loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay disparities were job-performance related, allowing employees to discuss salaries, and enabling women to sue for discrimination. Democrats argued it would help close the gender pay gap, where women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. Republicans criticized it as a "trial lawyers' bonanza," claiming it would lead to costly lawsuits and harm employers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Obama criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights. Republicans, led by Sen. Mike Enzi, opposed the bill, while moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe called it an "overreach." Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to reintroduce the bill until it passes.  
END OF SUMMARY.
