Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Hmm, first, I need to read through the article to understand the key points. It's about a bill related to pay discrimination against women. Democrats are pushing it, Republicans are blocking it. 

I should note the main arguments from both sides. Democrats say it's about equal pay and closing loopholes in the 1963 act. They mention specific provisions like requiring employers to prove pay differences are job-related and allowing employees to share salary info. They also highlight the political gain, aiming to win over women voters.

On the Republican side, they argue it's politically motivated and benefits trial lawyers. They think it's a trial lawyer bonanza and that it's not the right approach. Some, like Sen. McConnell,批评法案是政治操弄，而像Olympia Snowe这样的温和派共和党人也认为法案过激，会给雇主带来负担。

The summary needs to capture both parties' moral stances. Democrats are framing it as a fight for equality and women's rights, while Republicans are against it, seeing it as a political tool that unfairly targets employers and lawyers.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the main points: the bill's purpose, the vote outcome, the arguments from both sides, and the Democrats' vow to bring it back.

Let me structure it: start with the bill's purpose, mention the vote outcome, then the Democrats' stance and their reasons, followed by Republicans' counterarguments, and end with the Democrats' determination to pass it.

I need to ensure the moral framing is preserved, so highlighting the opposing viewpoints on fairness and political motives is crucial.

Okay, putting it all together now.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination was blocked in the Senate by Republicans, who accused it of being politically motivated and benefiting trial lawyers at employers' expense. The bill, which failed to reach the required 60 votes, sought to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to prove pay disparities were job-related, prohibiting salary secrecy, and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Democrats, including President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over women's rights, while Republicans argued the bill unfairly targeted employers and lacked bipartisan input. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and others labeled it a "trial lawyers' bonanza," emphasizing its potential to unleash costly lawsuits. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it an "overreach." Despite the setback, Democratic sponsor Sen. Barbara Mikulski vowed to reintroduce the measure until it passes. END OF SUMMARY.
