SUMMARY:

Democrats pushed for a bill to ensure women don't face pay discrimination, but Republicans blocked it, citing it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men. The bill aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences were related to job performance, not gender, and allowing women to sue for damages. Republicans argued they oppose pay discrimination but disagreed with the Democrats' bill, calling it an "overreach" that would put a "tremendous burden on employers" through lawsuits. Democrats vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, with Sen. Barbara Mikulski saying "We will be back... for equal pay, for equal rights."
