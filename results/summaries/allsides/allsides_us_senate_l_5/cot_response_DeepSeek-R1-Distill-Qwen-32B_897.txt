Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about a bill related to pay discrimination against women. Democrats are pushing for it, while Republicans are blocking it. 

I remember the user asked to identify morally framed words first. So, I'll go through the article and pick out words that have a moral connotation. Words like "discrimination," "reward," "expense," "blocked," "partisan," "ahead," "women," "families," "sand," "longstanding," "insensitive," "oppose," "pro-Democratic," "bonanza," "nothing," "little," "burden," "suits," "overreach," "vowed," "back," "pass," "equal," "rights." These words carry moral weight because they express approval or disapproval.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article into under 200 words, keeping those moral words intact. The key points are the Democrats' bill to address pay discrimination, Republicans blocking it, accusations of partisanship, the bill's specifics, and the reactions from both sides. I should include the vote outcome, President Obama's criticism, and the commitment from Democrats to reintroduce the bill. Also, mention the Republican arguments against it, like rewarding lawyers and the burden on employers.

I'll structure the summary by starting with the bill's purpose, then the Republican opposition, the vote result, the arguments from both sides, and the future intentions of the Democrats. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

Wait, did I miss any important details? The article mentions specific senators like Harry Reid, Lilly Ledbetter, Dean Heller, and Olympia Snowe. Including their roles might add depth, but since the summary is brief, I might not need all their names unless they're crucial. I think the main points are covered without them.

Also, the statistics about women earning 77 cents compared to men is a key point, so I should include that. The Republicans' alternative bill by Heller and the criticism it received should be mentioned briefly. The Democrats' strategy to gain political support with women voters is another important angle.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all sides without being too detailed. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence captures a main point and uses the morally framed words where appropriate.

**SUMMARY:**
A bill aimed at addressing gender-based pay discrimination faced opposition as Democrats and Republicans clashed over its merits. Democrats argued the measure would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to justify pay disparities based on performance and allowing women to sue for discrimination. They emphasized the wage gap, stating women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. Republicans, however, blocked the bill, 52-48, accusing it of being politically motivated and benefiting trial lawyers at employers' expense. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid criticized Republicans for ignoring the issue, while President Obama condemned their prioritization of politics over women and families. Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell and Mike Enzi, criticized the bill as an overreach, claiming it would burden employers with costly lawsuits. Moderate Republican Olympia Snowe also opposed it, calling it "regrettable." Despite the setback, Democratic sponsor Barbara Mikulski vowed to reintroduce the bill until it passes, underscoring their commitment to equal pay and rights. END OF SUMMARY.
