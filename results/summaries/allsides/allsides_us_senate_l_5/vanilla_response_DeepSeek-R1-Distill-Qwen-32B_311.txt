Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a bill related to pay discrimination against women. Democrats are pushing it, while Republicans are blocking it. 

First, I should identify the main points. The bill aims to prevent pay discrimination by closing loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act. It requires employers to prove pay differences are based on job performance, not gender, and allows employees to discuss salaries. Women could sue for damages if they feel discriminated against.

Democrats believe this would help close the pay gap, where women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn. They expect political gains by supporting this. On the other hand, Republicans argue the bill is politically motivated, benefits trial lawyers, and burdens employers with lawsuits. They didn't support it, and only one Republican, Dean Heller, spoke against it, suggesting an alternative.

Key players include President Obama criticizing Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who vows to bring it back. Moderate Republicans like Olympia Snowe also oppose the bill, calling it an overreach.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the bill's goals, the political divide, the arguments from both sides, and the key figures involved. Make sure it's concise and captures the essence without getting too detailed.

Mike Enzi, argued the bill was politically motivated and would lead to costly lawsuits. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it an overreach. The bill's sponsor, Sen.
