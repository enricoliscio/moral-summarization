SUMMARY: An election-year bill designed to ensure that women are not discriminated against in their pay was blocked by Republicans, who criticized the measure as politically motivated and claimed it would benefit trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, supported by Democrats, aimed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act by requiring employers to justify pay differences based on job performance rather than gender and by preventing employers from forbidding salary discussions among employees. While Democrats argued that the bill addressed the persistent pay gap between men and women, Republicans countered that it was an overreach that would burden employers with class-action lawsuits. Despite the defeat, the bill's sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, vowed to continue fighting for equal pay and equal rights for women. The motion fell short of the required 60 votes, receiving only 52, and President Obama condemned Republicans for prioritizing partisan politics over the rights and well-being of American women and families.
END OF SUMMARY.
