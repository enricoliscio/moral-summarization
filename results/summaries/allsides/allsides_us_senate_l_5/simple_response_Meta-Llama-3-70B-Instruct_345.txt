SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to ensure equal pay for women were blocked by Republicans, who claim the bill would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, designed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove pay differences are not based on gender and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats argue that women earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, while Republicans claim the bill is politically motivated and would lead to burdensome lawsuits. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue of pay discrimination, while Democrats vowed to continue fighting for equal pay. The moral framing of this issue is clear: Democrats stand up for the rights of women and families, while Republicans prioritize the interests of employers and trial lawyers.
