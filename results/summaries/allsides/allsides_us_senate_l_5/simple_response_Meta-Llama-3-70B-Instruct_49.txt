SUMMARY:

In a move widely seen as a political ploy, Republicans blocked a Democratic measure aimed at ensuring pay equity for women. The bill, which would have required employers to prove pay differences are based on performance, not gender, and allowed women to sue for damages, was criticized by Republicans as a "trial lawyers bonanza" that would burden employers with lawsuits. Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the bill was a necessary step to address the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men, with women earning only 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families" and "sticking their heads in the sand" about the issue. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, emphasizing the importance of fighting for equal pay and equal rights. END OF SUMMARY.
