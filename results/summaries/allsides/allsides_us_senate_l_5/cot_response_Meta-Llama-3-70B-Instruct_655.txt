SUMMARY:
Democrats pushed for a bill to ensure women don't face pay discrimination, but Republicans blocked it, claiming it would reward trial lawyers at employers' expense. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of "wanting to stick their heads in the sand" about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men. Democrats argued the bill would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, while Republicans claimed it was an "overreach" that would put a "tremendous burden" on employers through lawsuits. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "We will be back" to fight for "equal pay, for equal rights." END OF SUMMARY.
