Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a bill related to pay discrimination against women. Democrats support it, saying it ensures women aren't discriminated against in pay. Republicans oppose it, arguing it benefits trial lawyers and hurts employers.

I should highlight the key points: the bill's purpose, the opposing arguments from both parties, and the political implications. Also, note the vote outcome and the reactions from leaders like Obama, Reid, and McConnell.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and maintain the moral aspects each side presents. Make sure to include that the bill requires employers to justify pay differences and allows lawsuits. Republicans see it as a political move favoring lawyers, not women.

Finally, mention the Democrats' plan to reintroduce the bill despite the loss. That should cover the main points concisely.

SUMMARY: A Democratic bill aimed at addressing pay discrimination against women was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. Democrats argued the bill would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to justify pay differences based on job performance and allowing women to sue for discrimination. Republicans criticized it as politically motivated, benefiting trial lawyers at employers' expense. President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of ignoring the issue, while Republicans like Sen. Mike Enzi and Sen. Mitch McConnell argued the bill would lead to costly lawsuits and do little for women. Moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe also opposed the bill, calling it an overreach. Despite the vote failure, Democratic sponsor Sen. Barbara Mikulski vowed to reintroduce the bill until it passes. END OF SUMMARY.
