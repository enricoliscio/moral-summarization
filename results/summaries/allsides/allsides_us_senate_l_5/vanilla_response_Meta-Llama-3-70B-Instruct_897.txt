SUMMARY:

The US Senate blocked a Democratic measure aimed at ensuring equal pay for women, with Republicans arguing it would benefit trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, which needed 60 votes, received only 52, with no Republican support. Democrats claimed the bill would close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, requiring employers to prove pay differences are related to job performance, not gender. They also argued it would allow women to sue for damages if they believe they were discriminated against. Republicans countered that the bill was politically motivated and would lead to costly lawsuits. President Obama criticized Republicans for putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." The bill's sponsor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, vowed to bring the measure back until it passes. The issue is expected to be a key point in the upcoming election, with Democrats hoping to make political gains with women.

END OF SUMMARY.
