SUMMARY:

Democrats' efforts to ensure equal pay for women were blocked by Republicans, who claim the bill would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers. The bill, designed to close loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act, would require employers to prove pay differences are not based on gender and allow women to sue for damages. Democrats argue that women earn only 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, and that Republicans are putting "partisan politics ahead of American women and families." Republicans counter that the bill is "the wrong way of dealing with this issue" and would lead to "huge class-action suits" that would burden employers. Democrats vow to bring the measure back until it passes, saying "we will be back" and "we are not giving up for equal pay, for equal rights." The bill's supporters accuse Republicans of wanting to "stick their heads in the sand" about the longstanding issue of pay discrimination.
