Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to identify all the morally framed single words first. Let me break this down.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It's about President Trump's reaction to leaks and the moral implications involved. The article discusses the legal and ethical issues around leaking classified information, the duty to reveal information, and the role of the media.

For step one, I have to find all the single words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "fury," "embarrass," "intimidate," "felony," "concealing," "interference," "sinister," "unconstitutional," "absolute," "prefer," "transparency," "accountability," "oath," and "sacred." These words are used to convey the moral aspects of the situation.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include these moral terms. I should mention Trump's anger over the leaks, the legal issues with leaking classified info, the duty of intelligence officials to report, the media's protection under the First Amendment, and the tension between government secrecy and public right to know. I also need to touch on the Fourth Amendment implications and the president's oath to uphold the constitution.

I have to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the leaks, the moral and legal issues, the media's role, and the constitutional principles involved. I'll make sure to include the identified moral words to preserve the framing.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's reaction, then the legal and moral implications of leaking and concealing, the media's role, and the constitutional balance. Make sure each moral word is included where appropriate without making it sound forced.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to put it all together concisely.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Donald Trump has expressed intense fury over leaks of private and classified information, which have painted his administration in a negative light. The article highlights the moral and legal implications of leaking classified information, which is a felony, and the duty of intelligence officials to reveal all material information to their superiors. The leaks, including allegations about Trump's behavior and conversations with foreign officials, have fueled presidential anger. The article also discusses the two-sided nature of leaks: concealing information when there is a duty to reveal it is a form of interference, while publishing leaked material, even if confidential, is protected by the First Amendment. The media's role in publishing such information is seen as essential for public accountability, despite the government's attempts to restrict access. The article underscores the tension between government secrecy and the public's right to know, while emphasizing the constitutional principles that protect a free press. Trump's frustration with the press is noted, but the article reminds him of his oath to uphold the Constitution, which includes protecting the freedoms it guarantees.
