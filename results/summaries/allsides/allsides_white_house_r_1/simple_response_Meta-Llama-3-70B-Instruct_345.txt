SUMMARY:

President Trump's anger over recent leaks of private facts and classified information is understandable, but it raises important moral questions. Leaking classified information is a felony, and concealing information that should be revealed to the president is also a form of interference with a governmental function. However, the president's attempts to investigate and punish leakers may be misguided. The media has a constitutional right to publish leaked information, including gossip and top-secret data, as long as it is of material public interest. The president's oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution means he must respect this right, even if it causes him personal discomfort. The real concern is not the leaks themselves, but whether they are part of a sinister effort to manipulate the president's judgment or exercise power without accountability. Ultimately, transparency and accountability in government are essential values that must be upheld.
