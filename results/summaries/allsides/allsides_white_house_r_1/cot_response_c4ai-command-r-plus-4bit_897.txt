SUMMARY: President Donald Trump expressed fury over public revelations of private facts, including top-secret information and office gossip, which painted his administration in a bad light. Leaking classified information is a felony, yet the media is protected by the First Amendment and can publish leaked materials with impunity. The leaking of confidential information from within the White House has caused frustration for Trump, and he has faced challenges with a staff that may still be partially loyal to former President Barack Obama. The article discusses the moral and legal complexities of leaking and publishing classified information, the duty to reveal certain information, and the potential interference with the presidential judgment by unelected and unaccountable individuals. It also highlights the president's anger towards the media and his obligation to defend the freedom of the press, despite his personal frustrations. END OF SUMMARY.
