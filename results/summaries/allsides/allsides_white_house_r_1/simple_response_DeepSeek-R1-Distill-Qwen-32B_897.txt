Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Trump's reaction to leaks, both classified and non-classified, that have portrayed him negatively. He ordered investigations into these leaks. The author discusses the legal implications of leaking classified info, which is a felony. They mention that only a few people have access to top-secret data, so the leaks are coming from a small group. The article also covers specific instances of leaks, like allegations about Trump in Moscow and conversations with Michael Flynn. 

Then, the article shifts to the other side of leaksâ€”concealing information. It says that spies have a duty to reveal all material info to their superiors, and selectively hiding info is a felony. Trump's White House is dealing with leaks of Oval Office gossip, leading to the seizure of cellphones, which was also leaked. The author suggests this could be either growing pains or sinister forces manipulating the president.

The article also touches on the media's role. It states that publishing leaks is protected by the First Amendment, and the media can publish anything of public interest, regardless of how it was obtained. The author references Thomas Jefferson's support for a free press over government.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The author seems critical of the leaks but also defends the media's role in accountability. I should highlight Trump's anger, the legal issues with leaking, the duty to report info, the media's protection, and the tension between transparency and government control.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key moral points: the duty to report vs. leaking for personal reasons, the media's role, and the constitutional protections involved.
