Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump's reaction to leaks, both classified and confidential. The article discusses the legal implications of leaking classified info, the duty of spies to report all material, and the tension between leaking and concealing info. There's also mention of Oval Office gossip and the seizure of cellphones, which was itself leaked. The article touches on the First Amendment protections for the media and the conflict between Trump's anger and his duty to uphold the Constitution.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should use the morally charged words like "revelations," "leaks," "felony," "intimidate," "manipulating," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight Trump's anger, the legal issues, the duty to reveal vs. concealing, the media's role, and the constitutional principles involved.

I'll start by stating Trump's fury over the leaks, mention the classified and confidential nature, the legal implications, the Oval Office gossip, and the cellphone seizure. Then, I'll address the media's protection under the First Amendment and Trump's conflicting position as a constitutional officer. Finally, I'll tie it back to the tension between transparency and accountability.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Also, I should use the morally framed words naturally within the context to maintain the author's original framing.

SUMMARY:  
Last week, President Trump erupted over public revelations of private facts, including classified information and Oval Office gossip, which painted his administration unfavorably. He ordered the FBI and White House counsel to investigate the leaks, which are considered felonies if they involve classified material. The leaks, including allegations about his behavior in Moscow and intelligence reports contradicting his statements, fueled his anger. The article highlights the moral tension between revealing and concealing information: leaking can intimidate or manipulate presidential judgment, while concealing can interfere with governmental functions. The media’s role in publishing leaked material, protected by the First Amendment, adds to Trump’s frustration. However, the article emphasizes that while leaks may be a nuisance, they are not always criminal. The Oval Office gossip leaks, though not classified, still caused turmoil, leading to the seizure of staffers’ cellphones. The author suggests these events could reflect growing pains or sinister forces manipulating the president’s judgment. Despite his anger, Trump is bound by constitutional principles that protect a free press, as emphasized by the courts. The article underscores the conflict between transparency and accountability in government. END OF SUMMARY.
