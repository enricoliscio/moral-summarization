Okay, so I need to summarize this article about President Trump and the leaks in his administration. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump was angry because of leaks revealing private and classified information about him and the White House. He ordered the FBI and his counsel to investigate. It talks about the legal issues with leaking classified info, which is a felony. Then it goes into specific examples of leaks, like allegations about Trump's behavior in Moscow, phone transcripts with Flynn, and an intelligence report contradicting Trump's statements on immigration. The article also discusses how some leaks might be used to manipulate the president's judgment, which is a felony.

Another point is about the White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip, leading to the seizure of cellphones. This was also leaked, causing more issues. The article debates whether these leaks are just growing pains or part of a more sinister plan. It mentions that leaking confidential info from the White House isn't criminal, but the Fourth Amendment protects government employees' phones from being seized without a warrant. The media can publish leaks because the First Amendment protects them, especially since everything about the president is of public interest. The article ends by noting that Trump's anger is understandable but he's bound by the Constitution to protect press freedom, referencing Jefferson's support for transparency.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on Trump's reaction, the types of leaks, the legal implications, the debate over motives, and the media's role. I'll make sure to include key points like the felony aspect, specific leaks, the cellphone seizure, Fourth Amendment protections, media rights under the First Amendment, and the constitutional context.

SUMMARY: President Trump faced intense scrutiny last week due to a series of leaks revealing private and classified information about him and his administration. These leaks included allegations about his behavior in Moscow, phone transcripts involving Michael Flynn, and intelligence reports contradicting his statements on immigration. Trump ordered the FBI and his counsel to investigate, highlighting the legal issues surrounding the unauthorized disclosure of classified information, which is a felony. The article also discusses the potential manipulation of the president's judgment through selective leaks, another felony. Additionally, Oval Office gossip leaked by White House staff led to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones, an action itself leaked, adding to the controversy. The piece debates whether these leaks are merely growing pains or part of a sinister plan. It notes that while leaking confidential communications isn't criminal, the Fourth Amendment protects government employees' phones from seizure without a warrant. The media, however, can publish such leaks under the First Amendment, as everything about the president is deemed of public interest. Trump's anger is understandable, but he is bound by the Constitution to uphold press freedom, as emphasized by Jefferson's support for transparency. END OF SUMMARY.
