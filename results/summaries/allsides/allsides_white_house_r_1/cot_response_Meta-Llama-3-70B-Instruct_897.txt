SUMMARY:
President Trump's anger over recent leaks of private facts and classified information has led to FBI and White House investigations. The leaks, including lurid allegations and top-secret data, have embarrassed and infuriated the president. However, the duty to reveal information is crucial, and selectively concealing it is a felony. The president's woes are exacerbated by the other side of the coin - too much concealing. The White House staff's leaking of Oval Office gossip has added to the president's frustration, but it is not criminal. The media is protected by the First Amendment and can publish leaked data, even if it's top-secret or gossip. Trump's predecessors, like Thomas Jefferson, have emphasized the importance of accountability and transparency in government. END OF SUMMARY.
