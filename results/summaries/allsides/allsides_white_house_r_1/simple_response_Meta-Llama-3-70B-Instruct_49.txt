SUMMARY:

President Trump's anger over recent leaks of private facts and top-secret information is understandable, but he must also respect the duty of spies to reveal material information to their superiors and ultimately to the president. Selectively concealing and revealing intelligence data is a felony and a form of interference with a governmental function. On the other hand, leaks of confidential conversations from within the White House, although a pain for the president, are not criminal. The media has the right to publish leaked information, including top-secret data, as it is of material interest to the public and protected by the First Amendment. The president's oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution includes protecting a free press from government anger. As Thomas Jefferson said, accountability and transparency in government are of overriding value, and a free press is essential to achieving this.
