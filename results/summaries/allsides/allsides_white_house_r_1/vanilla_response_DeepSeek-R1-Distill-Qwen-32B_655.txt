Okay, I need to summarize this article about President Trump's reaction to leaks. Let me read through the article first. It starts by talking about how Trump got angry over leaks that painted him and the White House negatively. He ordered the FBI and his counsel to investigate. The article mentions classified leaks, confidential communications, and published materials. 

I should note that leaking classified info is a felony, and the NSA has 60k spies, but only a few have access to top-secret data. There were specific leaks about Moscow hotel allegations, Flynn's calls, and an intelligence report contradicting Trump's statements. The article also discusses the two sides of leaks: too much revealing and too much concealing. 

There's a part about Trump seizing staffers' cellphones to check for leaks, which was also leaked. The article questions if this is growing pains or sinister forces. It mentions the First Amendment protecting media publication of leaks, even if they're classified. The media can publish anything of public interest, including info about the president. 

I should highlight Trump's frustration with the press but his oath to uphold the Constitution, which protects a free press. Thomas Jefferson's quote about preferring newspapers over government ties in the importance of transparency. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on Trump's anger, the nature of the leaks, the legal aspects, the cellphone incident, media protections, and the tension between Trump and the press. Keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has expressed fury over recent leaks of classified and confidential information, some of which painted him and his administration in a negative light. He directed the FBI and his White House counsel to investigate the leaks, which include allegations about his behavior in Moscow, partial transcripts of calls involving Michael Flynn, and an intelligence report contradicting his statements on immigration. Leaking classified information is a felony, and the NSA’s compartmentalized structure limits access to sensitive data. Trump also faces issues with staffers leaking Oval Office gossip, leading to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones. While leaks of confidential communications are not criminal, the First Amendment protects media publication of leaked information, including details about the president. Trump’s frustration with the press is tempered by his constitutional oath to uphold freedom of the press, a principle championed by Thomas Jefferson. END OF SUMMARY.
