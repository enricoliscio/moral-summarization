SUMMARY:

President Trump's anger over recent leaks of private facts and classified information is understandable, but it raises important moral questions. Leaking classified information is a felony, and some in the intelligence community have done so to embarrass or control the president. However, there is also a duty to reveal material information to superiors and the president, and selectively concealing or revealing this information is a form of interference with a governmental function, also a felony. The leaks of confidential White House conversations are not criminal, but they do raise concerns about unelected individuals exercising judgment on national security matters. The media has the right to publish leaked information, including top-secret data, as it is protected by the First Amendment. The president's oath to preserve and protect the Constitution means he must also defend the freedom of the press, even when it publishes information that embarrasses him.
