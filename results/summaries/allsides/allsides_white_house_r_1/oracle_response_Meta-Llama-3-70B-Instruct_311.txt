SUMMARY:

President Trump's recent outbursts were sparked by a series of "revelations" of private facts, including top-secret information and office gossip, that painted him and his White House in a bad light. The president ordered the FBI to investigate these "leaks" and his own White House counsel to investigate others. However, the author notes that "leaking" classified information is a "felony", and that some in the intelligence community have done so to "embarrass, control, intimidate or infuriate" the president. Moreover, the author argues that "concealing" and "manipulating" intelligence data to influence the president's judgment is also a form of interference with a governmental function, and therefore a "felony". The article also touches on the issue of the media's role in publishing leaked material, concluding that they have the right to do so under the First Amendment. The author ultimately reminds Trump that he has taken an oath to "preserve, protect and defend" the very constitutional principles that protect a free press, even if it means enduring criticism.
