Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author presented. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Trump's reaction to leaks about his administration. There are classified leaks, confidential communications, and Oval Office gossip. Trump is angry and has ordered investigations. The author discusses the legal issues with leaking classified info, which is a felony. They mention the NSA and how only a few have access to top-secret data. There are specific examples of leaks, like the Moscow hotel allegations and the Flynn-Russia ambassador calls. The author also brings up the issue of selective concealment, which is a felony because spies have a duty to reveal all info to superiors.

Then there's the situation with White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip, leading to the seizure of cellphones. The article touches on the Fourth Amendment, protecting government employees from phone seizures without a warrant. The media's role is also discussed, with the First Amendment protecting their publication of leaks, even if they're classified. The author contrasts Trump's anger with the constitutional principles he swore to uphold, referencing Jefferson's support for a free press.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, preserving the moral aspects. I should highlight the tension between Trump's anger and the constitutional protections. Also, the legal implications of leaking and concealing information, and the role of the media in a democracy.

I'll structure the summary to first mention Trump's anger over leaks, then the legal issues, the examples of leaks, the cellphone seizure and its legal implications, the media's protections, and the moral dilemma between executive anger and constitutional principles.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting too detailed. Also, I need to maintain the author's framing, which seems to critique Trump's actions while supporting the constitutional rights of a free press and the rule of law.

Let me draft this, keeping an eye on the word count. Make sure to include all key elements without exceeding the limit. Also, end with the required tokens.
