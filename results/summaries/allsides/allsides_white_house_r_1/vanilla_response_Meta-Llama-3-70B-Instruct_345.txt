SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has been furious over recent leaks of private and top-secret information that have painted him and his White House in a bad light. He has ordered the FBI to investigate some of these leaks, while his White House counsel is investigating others. Leaking classified information is a felony, and only a select few in the intelligence community have access to top-secret data. However, concealing information that should be revealed is also a felony. The White House has also been dealing with leaks of Oval Office gossip, which has led to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones. While these leaks are not criminal, the government may not seize employees' cellphones without a search warrant. The media is protected by the First Amendment and may publish leaked information of public interest, including gossip or top-secret data.
