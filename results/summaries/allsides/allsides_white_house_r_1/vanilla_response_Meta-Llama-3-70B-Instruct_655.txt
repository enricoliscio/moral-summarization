SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump is furious over recent leaks of private and top-secret information that have painted him and his White House in a bad light. He has ordered the FBI and White House counsel to investigate the leaks, which include classified information, confidential communications, and published leaked material. Leaking classified information is a felony, and only about 100 spies have access to top-secret data. The article suggests that there are two sides to the coin: too much revealing and too much concealing. Concealing intelligence data from the president is also a felony. The White House staff has been leaking Oval Office gossip to the press, leading to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones. The media is protected by the First Amendment and can publish leaked data of material interest to the public. Trump's anger is understandable, but as president, he has taken an oath to preserve and defend the constitutional principles that protect a free press.
