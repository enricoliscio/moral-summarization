SUMMARY:
President Trump was enraged by recent leaks of private facts, including classified information and confidential communications, which painted him and his White House in a bad light. He ordered the FBI to investigate the leaks, which are a felony. However, the article argues that there is also a duty to reveal information, and selectively concealing it can be a form of interference with the president's judgment, also a felony. The leaks are a two-sided coin, with too much revealing on one side and too much concealing on the other. The article concludes that the president's anger is understandable, but he must also respect the First Amendment, which protects the media's right to publish leaked information, and uphold the principles of accountability and transparency in government. END OF SUMMARY.
