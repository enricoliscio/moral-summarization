Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump and the leaks in his administration. The article is pretty detailed, so I should break it down into key points. 

First, the article talks about Trump's fury over leaks that painted him and the White House negatively. He ordered the FBI and his counsel to investigate. There are different types of leaks mentioned: classified info, confidential communications, and published material. 

Next, it explains that leaking classified info is a felony, and some in the intelligence community did this to embarrass Trump. The NSA has many spies, but only a few have access to top-secret data. Specific examples of leaks include allegations about Trump in Moscow, conversations with Michael Flynn, and an intelligence report contradicting Trump's statements on immigration.

Then, the article discusses the issue of selective leaking and concealing, which can manipulate the president's judgment and is a felony. Trump's White House staff is also leaking Oval Office gossip, leading to seizing cellphones, which was itself leaked.

The article suggests these leaks could be growing pains or sinister forces trying to influence the president. However, leaking confidential communications isn't criminal, and the media can publish leaks under the First Amendment, especially regarding the president. Trump is angry but must uphold constitutional principles protecting the press, as noted by Jefferson.

So, the summary should cover Trump's response to leaks, the types of leaks, examples, the legal implications, and the media's role. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points without getting too bogged down in details.
