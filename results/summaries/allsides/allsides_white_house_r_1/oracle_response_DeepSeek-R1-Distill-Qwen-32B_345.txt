Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I'll start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article discusses President Trump's reaction to leaks of classified and confidential information. It mentions that leaking classified info is a felony and that some leaks were meant to embarrass Trump. There's also the issue of selective concealing of intelligence, which is another felony. The White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip is another point, leading to the seizure of cellphones, which was itself leaked.

The summary needs to include words like "revelations," "leaks," "felony," "concealing," "manipulating," "unelected," "unaccountable," "criminal," "protect," etc. I should structure the summary to cover the main issues: the leaks, their nature, the legal implications, Trump's actions, and the moral implications regarding government transparency and media freedom.

I'll start by stating Trump's anger over the leaks, mention the types of leaks (classified and confidential), and the legal consequences. Then, I'll touch on the White House staff leaks and the cellphone seizure. Finally, I'll address the media's role and the constitutional protections involved, highlighting the moral conflict between government control and press freedom.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll also make sure to end with the provided tokens.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has been angered by a series of revelations and leaks involving classified and confidential information, some of which were intended to embarrass or manipulate his judgment. Leaking classified information is a felony, and the intelligence community has been accused of selectively concealing or revealing data to influence the president's decisions. Additionally, White House staff have leaked Oval Office gossip, leading to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones. The leaks, while not criminal in themselves, raise concerns about unelected, unaccountable forces attempting to control national security decisions. The media's publication of leaked material, including top-secret information, is protected under the First Amendment, as everything about the president is considered material to the public interest. Trump's frustration with the press is understandable, but his oath to preserve the Constitution includes defending the freedoms that protect a free press, even when it conflicts with his authority. END OF SUMMARY.
