SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has recently expressed fury over a series of leaks that revealed private and classified information about his administration. The leaks, which included top-secret intelligence and office gossip, have raised concerns about the ethics of those involved. The article explores the moral and legal implications of leaking classified information, including the potential felony charges for revealing classified information and interfering with governmental functions. It also discusses the duty of spies to reveal material information about America's friends and enemies, and how selective concealing and revealing of information can manipulate presidential judgment. The article then turns to the leaks of confidential conversations within the White House, which while not criminal, are a breach of trust and a pain for the President. The media's role in publishing leaked information is also examined, highlighting the First Amendment protections that allow the publication of leaked data as long as it is of material interest to the public. Finally, the piece concludes with a reflection on the value of a free press in holding the government accountable and transparent, even in the face of presidential anger. END OF SUMMARY.
