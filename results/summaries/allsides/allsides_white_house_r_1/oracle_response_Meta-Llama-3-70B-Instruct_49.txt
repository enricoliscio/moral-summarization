SUMMARY:

President Trump's White House has been plagued by a series of "revelations" and "leaks" that have painted him and his administration in a bad light. The president has ordered investigations into these "felonies", which include the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and confidential communications. However, the article argues that there is also a duty to "reveal" information, particularly for spies who have a legal obligation to pass on material information to their superiors. Selectively "concealing" and "revealing" this information can be a form of "manipulating" the president's judgment, which is also a felony. The article suggests that these "leaks" may be the result of either growing pains in the new administration or sinister forces attempting to "exercise their own judgment" and "frustrate" the president's decision-making. The media has a First Amendment right to publish these "leaks", and the president has a constitutional duty to "preserve, protect, and defend" this right, even if it means enduring criticism and scrutiny.
