Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump's reaction to leaks of classified information and Oval Office gossip. He's angry and has ordered investigations. The author talks about the legal issues with leaking classified info, which is a felony. There are specific leaks mentioned, like the Moscow hotel allegations and Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador. These leaks are causing Trump to act, but the author also points out that concealing information when there's a duty to reveal it is also a crime. 

Then, there's the issue with White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip, leading Trump to seize cellphones. But the article mentions that the Fourth Amendment protects government employees from such seizures without a warrant. The media's role is also discussedâ€”publishing leaks is protected by the First Amendment, so they can't be prosecuted. The author quotes Jefferson, emphasizing the importance of a free press.

I need to capture all these points in a summary under 200 words. I should highlight Trump's actions, the legal implications of leaking and concealing, the cellphone seizure issue, and the media's protections. Also, the moral framing about the balance between government secrecy and public accountability is important.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump's anger and the leaks, mention the legal aspects of leaking and concealing, talk about the cellphone incident and Fourth Amendment, then the media's role and First Amendment protections. End with the Jefferson quote to tie it back to the value of a free press.

I should make sure each point is concise and flows logically. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. I'll make sure the summary reflects the author's moral perspective on the importance of transparency and the dangers of unchecked power.
