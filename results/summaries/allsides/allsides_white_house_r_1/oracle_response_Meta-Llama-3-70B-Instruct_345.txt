SUMMARY:

President Trump's White House is plagued by a series of "revelations" and "leaks" of private facts, including top-secret information and office gossip. The president has ordered investigations into these "felonies," which include the unauthorized "revealing" of classified information and confidential communications. However, the article suggests that there is also a duty to "reveal" certain information, and selectively "concealing" it can be a form of "manipulating" the president's judgment, which is also a "felony." The White House staff's "leaking" of Oval Office gossip has led to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones, which may violate the Fourth Amendment. The media is protected by the First Amendment and can publish leaked information, even if it was "stolen." The article concludes that while Trump may be frustrated, he has a duty to "preserve, protect, and defend" the constitutional principles that protect a free press, even if it means allowing the publication of embarrassing "revelations."

END OF SUMMARY.
