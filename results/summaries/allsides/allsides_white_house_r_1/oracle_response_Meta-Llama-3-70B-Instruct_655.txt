SUMMARY:

President Trump's anger over recent revelations of private facts, including top-secret and office gossip, has led to FBI and White House investigations. However, the issue of leaking government information is complex, involving both the felony of revealing classified information and the duty to reveal material facts to superiors. Selectively concealing and revealing intelligence data to manipulate presidential judgment is also a felony. The White House staff's leaking of confidential conversations to the press has added to the president's woes, raising questions about whether this is a result of growing pains or sinister forces attempting to exercise their own judgment on national security. The latter situation would be perilous, as it would mean unelected, unaccountable, and unnamed people pulling the levers of power. While the media is protected by the First Amendment to publish leaked materials, the president has a duty to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, including the principles that protect a free press.
