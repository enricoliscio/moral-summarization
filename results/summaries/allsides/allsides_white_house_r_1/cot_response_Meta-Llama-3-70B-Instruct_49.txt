SUMMARY:
President Trump's administration is plagued by leaks of classified and confidential information, which has sparked fury and led to investigations. The leaks, including lurid allegations and partial transcripts of conversations, have embarrassed and infuriated the president. However, the duty to reveal information is just as important as the duty to conceal it, and selectively manipulating intelligence data is a felony. The president's woes are further complicated by the concealing of information, which is a form of interference with governmental functions. The White House staff's leaking of Oval Office gossip has added to the president's pain, but it is not criminal. The media is protected by the First Amendment to publish leaked data, and the president's oath to defend the Constitution means he must protect a free press, even if it means accountability and transparency in government. END OF SUMMARY.
