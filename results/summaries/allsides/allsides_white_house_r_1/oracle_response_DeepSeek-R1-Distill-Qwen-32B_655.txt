Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words that I should include as much as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about President Trump's reaction to leaks, which include classified information and Oval Office gossip. He's angry and ordered investigations. The author uses words like "revelations," "leaks," "felony," and "intimidate." I need to make sure these are included.

I should mention that leaking classified info is a felony and how some leaks were meant to embarrass Trump. Also, the NSA's role and the limited access to top-secret data. The leaks about Moscow hotel allegations, Flynn's conversations, and the intelligence report contradicting Trump's statements are key points.

The article also discusses the two-sided nature of leaks: too much revealing and too much concealing. This is a moral issue because it's about duty to reveal information. The White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip is another point, leading to seizing cellphones, which was also leaked.

The author contrasts the administration's growing pains with sinister forces manipulating the president. This is a moral concern about unelected, unaccountable people influencing decisions. The legal aspects, like the Fourth Amendment protecting government employees' phones, and the First Amendment protecting media publication, are important too.

The article ends by highlighting the tension between Trump's anger and his oath to protect constitutional principles. Jefferson's quote about preferring newspapers over government ties into the value of a free press.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to include all the key moral points and the specific words. I'll keep it concise, around 200 words, and ensure it flows logically from Trump's anger to the implications of leaks and the constitutional principles involved.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump has reacted furiously to a series of revelations and leaks that exposed private and classified information, painting his administration in a negative light. The leaks include classified data, confidential communications, and Oval Office gossip, some of which aim to intimidate or embarrass him. The author highlights the moral and legal implications of leaking, noting that revealing classified information without clearance is a felony. Some leaks, such as allegations about Trump's behavior in Moscow and partial transcripts of conversations involving Michael Flynn, have fueled his anger. The article also explores the dual nature of leaks: while too much revealing can harm the president, selective concealing of intelligence to manipulate his judgment is equally problematic and a form of interference. The White House staff's leaking of Oval Office gossip led to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones, an action itself leaked by an unhappy participant. The author questions whether these events stem from growing pains or sinister forces seeking to manipulate the president. While leaking confidential communications is not criminal, the media's First Amendment right to publish such information, regardless of its origin, is absolute. Trump's frustration with the press is understandable, but his oath to preserve constitutional principles, including a free press, underscores the moral and legal complexities at play. END OF SUMMARY.
