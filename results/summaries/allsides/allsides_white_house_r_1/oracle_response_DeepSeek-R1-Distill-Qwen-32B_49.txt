Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is upset about leaks that paint him negatively. There are classified leaks, confidential communications being published, and Oval Office gossip. The article discusses the legal aspects, like leaking classified info being a felony, and the duty of spies to reveal information. It also touches on the media's role and First Amendment protections. The author contrasts the legal issues with the moral implications, using words like "felony," "leaks," "intimidate," "manipulate," etc.

I should structure the summary to cover Trump's reaction, the nature of the leaks, the legal and moral issues, and the media's role. I'll need to use the provided moral words where appropriate. Let me make sure to include terms like "revelations," "leaks," "felony," "reveal," "intimidate," "leaked," "concealing," "manipulating," "unelected," "unaccountable," "unnamed," "criminal," "insulates," "protects," "stolen," "preserve," "protect," "defend," "liberate."

I'll start by stating Trump's fury over the leaks, then mention the classified and confidential nature. I'll note the legal consequences, the duty to reveal, and the manipulation aspect. Then, I'll address the Oval Office gossip and the cellphone seizure, highlighting the Fourth Amendment. Next, I'll cover the media's right to publish under the First Amendment, including the stolen tax returns example. Finally, I'll conclude with Trump's oath to uphold constitutional principles and the moral implications of the leaks versus a free press.

I need to keep each point concise to stay within the word limit. Let me draft the summary, ensuring each moral term is included where it fits naturally without forcing it. I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words. Once done, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump erupted over revelations of private and classified leaks, some of which painted him negatively. Leaking classified information is a felony, and selective concealment or manipulation of intelligence data to influence presidential judgment is also illegal. The leaks included allegations about Trump's behavior, conversations with Gen. Flynn, and intelligence contradicting his travel ban claims. Trump's frustration also stems from Oval Office gossip leaked by staffers, leading to the seizure of government-issued cellphones. While leaking confidential communications isn't criminal, the Fourth Amendment protects government employees from unwarranted searches. Media publication of leaked material, including gossip and top-secret data, is protected under the First Amendment. The article highlights the tension between constitutional principles safeguarding a free press and the risks of unelected, unaccountable forces manipulating government functions. Trump, sworn to preserve these principles, faces a conflict between his anger and the constitutional protections he must uphold. END OF SUMMARY.
