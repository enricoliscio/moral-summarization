SUMMARY:

President Trump's anger over recent leaks of private facts about him and his White House is understandable, but it's a two-sided coin. On one hand, leaking classified information or confidential communications is a felony. On the other hand, concealing material information from the president is also a felony and a form of interference with a governmental function. The White House staff's leaking of Oval Office gossip to the press is not criminal, but it raises concerns about the integrity of the administration. The media has the right to publish leaked materials, including top-secret information, as long as it's of material public interest. The president's oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution includes protecting a free press, even if it means tolerating criticism. The moral of the story is that accountability and transparency in government are of overriding value, and a free press is essential to achieving that.
