Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about President Trump's reaction to leaks and the legal and ethical issues involved. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I need to make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is angry because of leaks that portray him negatively. He's using the FBI and his counsel to investigate. The article talks about classified information leaks, which are felonies, and how some leaks are meant to embarrass him. It also discusses the NSA's role and the duty of spies to report information, not to conceal it. There's a conflict between revealing and concealing information, which can manipulate the president's judgment. The White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip leads to seizing cellphones, which itself gets leaked. The article contrasts the legal issues with the First Amendment protections for the press. Trump's frustration is evident, but the author points out that the Constitution protects press freedom, which is a key moral point.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with Trump's fury over leaks, mention the classified leaks as felonies, the NSA's role, the duty to reveal, and the manipulation aspect. Then talk about the Oval Office leaks and the cellphone seizure, which was also leaked. Highlight the legal issues versus the First Amendment protections, and conclude with the tension between Trump's anger and the constitutional principles he swore to uphold.

I should use as many of the provided moral words as possible without making it forced. Words like "revelations," "leaks," "leaking," "felony," "reveal," "intimidate," "leaked," "revealing," "concealing," "manipulating," "unelected," "unaccountable," "unnamed," "criminal," "insulates," "protects," "stolen," "preserve," "protect," "defend," "liberate" should be included where appropriate.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral dimensions of the article. It's important to balance the government's need for secrecy with the press's role in accountability, highlighting the ethical dilemmas involved.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump recently erupted over a series of revelations and leaks that painted him and his administration in a negative light. The leaks, some classified and others mere gossip, have led Trump to order investigations into those responsible. Leaking classified information is a felony, and the article highlights the tension between the duty to reveal sensitive data and the potential for manipulation or concealment. The NSA's compartmentalized structure means only a few have access to top-secret data, yet leaks about Trump's alleged behavior in Moscow, Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador, and intelligence contradicting his policies have fueled his anger. The article also discusses the moral and legal implications of leaking Oval Office gossip, which, while not criminal, has led to the seizure of staff cellphones. The First Amendment protects the media's right to publish leaked information, even if it involves stolen or confidential data. Trump's frustration with the press is evident, but the Constitution he swore to preserve, protect, and defend also liberates the free press, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in governance. END OF SUMMARY.
