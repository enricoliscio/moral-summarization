SUMMARY: Last week, President Donald Trump expressed outrage over a series of public revelations of private and classified information, ordering investigations into the leaks. The leaking of classified information is a felony, and the recent leaks have potentially endangered national security and the integrity of the presidency. The intelligence community has a duty to reveal material information to their superiors and ultimately to the president, but selective revealing and concealing of intelligence data can interfere with the presidential judgment and is a form of felony. The leaks from within the White House, while not criminal, indicate a potential breach of trust and loyalty within the administration. The Fourth Amendment protects government employees' cellphones from governmental seizure without a search warrant. The media has absolute protection under the First Amendment to publish leaked materials, even if they are top-secret, as long as they are of material interest to the public. This situation raises concerns about the potential interference and manipulation of the president's judgment by unelected, unaccountable, and unnamed individuals.
