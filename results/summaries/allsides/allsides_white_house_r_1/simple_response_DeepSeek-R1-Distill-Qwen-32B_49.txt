Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's reaction to leaks. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Trump was angry over leaks of classified and confidential information. He ordered the FBI and White House counsel to investigate. It mentions that leaking classified info is a felony, and some leaks were about sensitive matters like the Moscow hotel allegations and Flynn's conversations. There's also a point about the duty of intelligence officials to report all info, so selective leaking is a crime.

Then, there's the issue of White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip, leading to the seizure of cellphones. The article discusses the Fourth Amendment implications, saying the government can't seize phones without a warrant. It also covers media rights under the First Amendment, protecting their publication of leaks, even if they're classified.

The author seems to present both sides: the problem of leaks and the constitutional protections for press freedom. The moral framing is about the balance between national security and freedom of the press, as well as the ethical duty of intelligence officials to report all info.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's actions, the nature of the leaks, the legal implications, and the moral/constitutional arguments. Make sure to highlight the tension between security and press freedom, and the duty to report vs. selective leaking.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's reaction, mention the types of leaks, the legal consequences, the cellphone seizure and its implications, the media's role and First Amendment, and the moral dilemma presented. Keep it concise but cover all key points.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Make sure each sentence adds value without being redundant. Also, maintain the original's moral perspective on the importance of transparency and accountability versus the need to protect sensitive info.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let me put it all together in a coherent summary.
