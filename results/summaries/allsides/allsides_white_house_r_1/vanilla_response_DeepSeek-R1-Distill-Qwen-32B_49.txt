Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump and the leaks. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by saying Trump was angry because of leaks revealing private and top-secret info, making the White House look bad. He ordered the FBI and his counsel to investigate. 

Then it talks about different types of leaks: classified info, confidential communications, and published leaks. It mentions that leaking classified info is a felony, and some spies in the NSA have access to top-secret data, which was leaked about Trump's behavior and Flynn's conversations. 

The article also discusses the duty of spies to report all info to the president, and how selective leaking can manipulate his judgment, which is a felony. 

There's also a part about White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip, leading to seizure of cellphones, but that was leaked too. The article questions if this is just growing pains or sinister forces. 

It clarifies that leaking confidential communications isn't criminal, but the Fourth Amendment protects government employees' phones. The media can publish leaks because of the First Amendment, even if it's about the president. 

The article ends by noting Trump's anger towards the press but his duty to uphold constitutional rights, referencing Jefferson's support for a free press.

So, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on Trump's reaction, the types of leaks, the legal implications, the cellphone incident, media rights, and the constitutional context.

SUMMARY: President Trump faced intense backlash last week due to leaks of classified and confidential information, sparking his fury and prompting orders for investigations by the FBI and White House counsel. The leaks included sensitive details about Trump's alleged behavior, conversations involving Michael Flynn, and intelligence reports contradicting Trump's statements. Leaking classified information is a felony, and selective concealment of intelligence to manipulate presidential judgment is also illegal. Additionally, White House staff leaked Oval Office gossip, leading to the seizure of cellphones, an incident itself leaked by an unhappy participant. The article questions whether these events stem from growing pains or sinister interference. While leaking confidential communications isn't criminal, the Fourth Amendment protects government employees' phones. The media, under the First Amendment, can publish leaked information, including sensitive data about the president. Trump's frustration with the press contrasts with his constitutional duty to uphold freedoms of the press, as emphasized by Jefferson. END OF SUMMARY.
