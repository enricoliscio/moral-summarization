SUMMARY:

President Trump has been furious over recent leaks of private facts and classified information, ordering the FBI and White House counsel to investigate. Leaking classified information is a felony, and only about 100 spies have access to top-secret data. However, concealing information that should be revealed to the president is also a felony. Trump's woes are exacerbated by White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip to the press, leading to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones. The media is protected by the First Amendment and can publish leaked materials, including top-secret information, without fear of criminal or civil action. Trump's anger towards the press is understandable, but as president, he has taken an oath to protect the constitutional principles that ensure a free press. His predecessors, like Thomas Jefferson, have recognized the importance of accountability and transparency in government.
