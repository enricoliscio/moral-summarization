SUMMARY:
President Trump's administration is dealing with a series of leaks, including classified information and confidential communications, which has sparked fury and investigations. However, the article highlights that leaks are a two-sided coin, and concealing information can be just as problematic as revealing it. The duty to reveal information is crucial, and selectively concealing it can be a form of interference with the president's judgment, which is a felony. The article also notes that the media has the right to publish leaked information, even if it's top-secret, as it is of material interest to the public. Trump's anger towards the press is understandable, but he has taken an oath to protect the very constitutional principles that protect a free press. The article concludes that accountability and transparency in government are of overriding value. END OF SUMMARY.
