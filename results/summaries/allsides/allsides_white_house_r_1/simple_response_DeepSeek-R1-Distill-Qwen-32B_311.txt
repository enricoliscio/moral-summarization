Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The article is about President Trump's reaction to leaks and the moral implications involved.

First, I should read through the article carefully. It talks about Trump's fury over leaks, both classified and gossip. He's ordering investigations. The article mentions that leaking classified info is a felony, but leaking gossip isn't. There's a discussion about the duty of spies to report all info, so selective leaking is a problem. The White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip led to seizing cellphones, which was itself leaked. The article also touches on the media's right to publish under the First Amendment, even if it's stolen, like Trump's tax returns.

Now, I need to capture the moral aspects. The article contrasts the duty to report information with the misuse of leaks to manipulate the president. It also highlights the tension between government authority and media freedom. The moral framing includes the dangers of unelected individuals influencing decisions and the importance of transparency and accountability in government.

I should structure the summary to include Trump's actions, the legal issues with leaks, the White House staff's role, the media's rights, and the underlying moral concerns. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's anger over leaks, both classified and gossip. Then, note the legal implications of leaking classified info versus gossip. Highlight the duty of spies to report all info and how selective leaking is a felony. Mention the cellphone seizure and the leak of that incident. Discuss the media's First Amendment rights and the tension between government and press. Finally, touch on the moral implications of unelected individuals influencing power and the balance between transparency and security.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and covers all the main moral points without being too verbose. I'll check the word count to ensure it's concise.

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump has expressed anger over leaks of classified and confidential information, some of which have painted his administration negatively. The leaks include sensitive intelligence, Oval Office gossip, and partial transcripts of conversations involving national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate classified leaks and his White House counsel to look into others. The article highlights the moral and legal implications of leaking, noting that revealing classified information is a felony, while leaking gossip is not. However, selectively concealing intelligence to manipulate the president's judgment is considered interference with a governmental function, also a felony. The White House staff's leaks of confidential conversations led to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones, an incident that was itself leaked. The article emphasizes the tension between government authority and media freedom, as the First Amendment protects the media's right to publish leaked information, even if it's stolen. While Trump criticizes the press, he is bound by the constitutional principles he swore to uphold, which value transparency and accountability in government. The moral framing underscores the dangers of unelected individuals influencing national security decisions and the importance of balancing transparency with security. END OF SUMMARY.
