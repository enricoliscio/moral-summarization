SUMMARY:

President Donald Trump has been furious over recent leaks of private facts and classified information, ordering the FBI and White House counsel to investigate. Leaking classified information is a felony, and only a small group of around 100 spies have access to top-secret data. Leaks have revealed lurid allegations about Trump's behavior, partial transcripts of conversations with the Russian ambassador, and an intelligence report contradicting his publicly stated conclusions. On the other hand, concealing information that should be revealed to the president is also a felony. The White House staff has also been leaking Oval Office gossip to the press, leading to the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones. While the leaks are a pain for the president, they are not criminal, and the media has the right to publish them under the First Amendment. Trump's anger is understandable, but as president, he has sworn to protect the constitutional principles that protect a free press.
