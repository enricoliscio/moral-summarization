Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants two things: first, to identify all the single words in the article that carry a moral connotation, and second, to write a concise summary that includes as many of those morally framed words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get a sense of its content. It's about President Trump's reaction to leaks, both classified and confidential, that have painted him and his administration in a negative light. The article discusses the legal implications of leaking classified information, the duty of spies to reveal information, and the role of the media in publishing such leaks. It also touches on constitutional protections like the First and Fourth Amendments.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through each paragraph and pick out words that carry a moral or ethical connotation. Words like "fury," "embarrass," "intimidate," "felony," "duty," "interference," "perilous," "loyal," "sinister," "unaccountable," "manipulating," "constitutional," "transparency," and "accountability" come to mind. These words are used to convey judgment or ethical implications in the context of the article.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should capture the main points: Trump's anger over leaks, the legal issues with leaking classified info, the duty to reveal information, the media's role, and the constitutional protections involved. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's framing.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Trump's reaction, moving into the legal and ethical issues, and then discussing the media's role and constitutional aspects. I'll ensure that each sentence is concise and that the morally framed words are integrated naturally.

Let me draft the summary step by step. Begin with Trump's fury over the leaks, mention the classified and confidential nature, then discuss the legal implications and the duty of spies. Then, touch on the media's role and the constitutional protections. Finally, conclude with the tension between Trump's anger and the principles he swore to uphold.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll keep each part brief. I'll also check that all the key morally framed words are included without making the summary feel forced.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure clarity and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and the author's perspective on the ethical issues involved.
