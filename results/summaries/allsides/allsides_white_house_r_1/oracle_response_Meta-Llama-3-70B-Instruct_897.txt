SUMMARY:

President Trump's White House has been plagued by a series of "revelations" and "leaks" that have painted him and his administration in a bad light. The president has ordered the FBI to investigate these "felonies" and his own White House counsel to investigate others. However, the author notes that "leaking" classified information is a two-sided coin, with the other side being "concealing" information that has a duty to be "revealed". This selective "concealing" and "revealing" of intelligence data can be a form of "manipulating" the president's judgment, which is also a "felony". The article suggests that these events could be either the growing pains of a new administration or the result of "sinister forces" attempting to exercise their own judgment about America's foes. The author concludes that while the president may be frustrated, he has a duty to "preserve, protect, and defend" the constitutional principles that protect a free press, even if it means allowing the publication of "leaked" materials.
