SUMMARY:

President Trump has been furious over recent leaks of private facts and classified information that paint him and his White House in a bad light. He has ordered the FBI and White House counsel to investigate the leaks. Leaking classified information is a felony, and only a select few in the intelligence community have access to top-secret data. The president's anger is understandable, given the recent leaks about his alleged behavior in a Moscow hotel room and conversations between his national security adviser and the Russian ambassador. However, the other side of the coin is the duty to reveal information to the president, and selectively concealing it is also a felony. The White House staff has also been leaking Oval Office gossip to the press, which has resulted in the temporary seizure of government-issued cellphones. The media is protected by the First Amendment and can publish leaked data of material public interest, including gossip and top-secret information.

END OF SUMMARY.
