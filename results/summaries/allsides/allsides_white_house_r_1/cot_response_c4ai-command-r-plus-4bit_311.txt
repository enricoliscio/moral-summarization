END OF STEP 1

SUMMARY: President Donald Trump expressed fury over public revelations of classified information and private secrets, which painted him and his administration in a bad light. The leaks included top-secret intelligence data and confidential conversations from within the White House. The president ordered investigations into these so-called leaks, which are considered felonies under US law. The article discusses the moral implications of leaking classified information, as well as the duty to reveal certain information. It also highlights the Fourth Amendment protections for government employees' cellphones and the First Amendment rights of the media to publish leaked information. The author concludes by reflecting on the tension between freedom of the press and government accountability, citing Thomas Jefferson's preference for newspapers over a government without accountability and transparency.
