SUMMARY:

President Trump's anger over recent leaks of private facts and classified information is understandable, but it highlights a larger issue of accountability and transparency in government. Leaks can be a felony, but so can concealing information that is duty-bound to be revealed. The president's judgment is being manipulated by unelected, unaccountable individuals who are selectively revealing and concealing intelligence data. This is a perilous situation, as it undermines the president's constitutional powers. While the leaks of confidential conversations from within the White House may be a pain for the president, they are not criminal. The media has the right to publish leaked information, as it is of material public interest and protected by the First Amendment. Trump's oath to preserve and defend the Constitution includes protecting a free press, even if it means accountability and transparency in government. As Thomas Jefferson said, "accountability and transparency in government are of such overriding value that [he'd] prefer newspapers without a government to a government without newspapers."
