Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about President Trump's reaction to leaks and the legal implications. It starts with Trump getting angry over leaks that portrayed him negatively. He ordered the FBI and his counsel to investigate. 

I should note the key points: classified leaks are felonies, the NSA's structure, specific leaks about Moscow, Flynn, and the travel ban. Then, the article mentions the duty of spies to report information, making selective concealment a felony. 

There's also the issue with White House staff leaking Oval Office gossip, leading to seizing cellphones. The article discusses the Fourth Amendment protecting government employees' phones without consent. Media can publish leaks because of the First Amendment, especially regarding the president. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's fury, the types of leaks, the legal aspects, the NSA details, specific examples, the cellphone seizure, and the constitutional protections for media. I'll ensure it's concise and covers all main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
President Donald Trump recently reacted with anger to a series of leaks revealing private and classified information about him and his administration. He ordered the FBI to investigate some leaks and his White House counsel to handle others. Leaking classified information is a felony, and the NSA's compartmentalized structure limits access to sensitive data, with only a few having access to top-secret info. Leaks included allegations about Trump's behavior in Moscow, transcripts of Michael Flynn's calls with the Russian ambassador, and intelligence contradicting Trump's claims on immigration. The article also discusses the duty of intelligence officials to share all material information with the president, making selective concealment a felony. Additionally, Trump faced leaks of Oval Office gossip, leading to the seizure of staff cellphones, which itself was leaked. The article highlights the tension between leaks and constitutional protections, noting that while leaks of confidential communications are not criminal, media publication of such information is protected by the First Amendment. Trump's anger toward the press is noted, but the Constitution safeguards a free press. END OF SUMMARY.
