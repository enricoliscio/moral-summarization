SUMMARY: President Donald Trump is furious over recent public revelations of private and classified information that paint him and his administration in a bad light. The leaks, which include top-secret intelligence and confidential White House conversations, have raised questions about the ethics and legality of revealing such information. Some leaks were potentially criminal, including the revelation of classified information by members of the intelligence community, which may have been done to embarrass, control, intimidate, or infuriate the president. There is also a duty to reveal certain information to superiors and the president, and selectively concealing or revealing such intelligence data can be seen as interference with governmental functions and the president's judgment. The article also discusses the moral implications of leaking confidential White House conversations, which may be a pain for the president but are not criminal. The media's role in publishing leaked information is protected by the First Amendment, and courts have ruled that everything about the president is of material public interest. The piece concludes by highlighting the tension between the president's anger towards the press and his duty to uphold the constitutional principles that protect a free press. END OF SUMMARY.
