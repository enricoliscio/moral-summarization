Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about two men being hanged in Iran for sodomy. The author is critical of the U.S. response, pointing out the administration's tough position between human rights and diplomacy. 

First, I'll note the key points: the executions, the Obama administration's engagement with Iran, the strategic importance of Iran in the region, and the political implications for the U.S. Also, the article mentions how conservatives in the U.S. use this issue to criticize the administration, highlighting the complexities.

I should use the morally charged words like "hanging," "executions," "oppression," "tragedy," etc. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main ideas without getting too detailed. 

I'll start by stating the executions, the uncertainty about the cause, the administration's dilemma, the strategic context, and the political dynamics. Then, I'll touch on the broader implications of using LGBT issues in foreign policy, as that's a key moral point.

Let me structure this: mention the executions, the administration's position, the strategic importance, the political criticism, and the critique of homonationalism. Make sure to include the moral terms throughout.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the necessary moral language.

SUMMARY:  
The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, highlights a moral dilemma for the U.S. government. While the executions raise concerns about human rights, particularly for the LGBT community, the Obama administration faces a complex balance between advocating for equality and pursuing diplomatic engagement with Iran. This engagement is seen as crucial for managing regional chaos, such as the conflict in Iraq and the threat of the Islamic State. However, conservatives in the U.S. often use Iran’s persecution of gays as a tool to criticize the administration’s policy, creating a political battleground. The article critiques the notion of "homonationalism," where LGBT rights are invoked selectively for strategic interests, potentially overshadowing broader human rights concerns. The administration is caught between addressing Iran’s repression of gays and advancing its diplomatic agenda, while the broader implications of imposing Western sexual norms on other cultures remain a moral challenge. The tragedy underscores the difficulty of addressing such issues without exacerbating existing tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
