SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, has sparked a moral dilemma for the Obama administration. Despite Iran's horrific human rights record, including over 400 executions in the first half of 2014, the administration has been pursuing a policy of constructive engagement with the Iranian regime. However, this execution, which may be part of a wave of oppression, puts the administration in a tight spot. Conservatives, who normally oppose LGBT equality, are now using this incident to criticize the administration's engagement policy, while liberals are hesitant to speak out due to the complexities of international politics. The author argues that this phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," is a form of imperialism, where Western conceptions of sexual and gender identity are imposed on other cultures, perpetuating the myth that sexual diversity is a Western invention. The tragic execution of these two men may ultimately be used to justify further oppression, rather than spark meaningful change. END OF SUMMARY.
