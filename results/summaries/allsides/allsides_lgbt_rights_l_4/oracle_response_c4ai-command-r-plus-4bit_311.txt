SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy highlights a difficult situation for the Obama administration, which must balance LGBT human rights with international politics and strategic interests. While the administration has been attempting a rapprochement with Iran to halt its nuclear program and manage the chaos in Iraq, Iran's human rights record, including the persecution of LGBT individuals, remains a challenge. Conservatives in the United States have seized on Iran's treatment of gay people to criticize the administration's engagement policy, despite their own domestic opposition to LGBT equality. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves using LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies and impose Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures. As a result, the administration finds itself caught between competing demands and may choose to remain silent on this latest tragedy to avoid making the situation worse. END OF SUMMARY.
