SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy has sparked debate over the Obama administration's response, given its delicate diplomatic agenda with Iran. While conservatives in the U.S. have been quick to criticize the administration for not doing enough to defend LGBT rights in Iran, the administration is caught between pursuing engagement with Iran to halt its nuclear program and managing the chaos in Iraq. The article argues that invoking LGBT equality as a justification for American foreign policy, or "homonationalism," is a complex issue, as it can inhibit the tolerance of non-Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity. Additionally, the administration's attempts to balance LGBT human rights with international politics have resulted in criticism from both conservatives and progressives. Ultimately, the author suggests that the administration and the LGBT movement may choose to remain relatively quiet on this issue to avoid exacerbating tensions.
END OF SUMMARY.
