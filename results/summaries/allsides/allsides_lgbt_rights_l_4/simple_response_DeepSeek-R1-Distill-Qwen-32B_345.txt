Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about two men being hanged in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy. It mentions that while this is a human rights issue, especially for the LGBT community, the US government isn't eager to address it because of their diplomatic efforts with Iran. The administration is trying to balance human rights concerns with strategic interests, like dealing with the nuclear program and the situation in Iraq.

I also see that there's a political angle where conservatives in the US are using this issue to criticize the Obama administration's foreign policy. The author points out the irony where some who oppose LGBT rights domestically support it internationally for political gain. There's a mention of homonationalism, which is using LGBT rights as a tool for nationalistic policies, potentially imposing Western values on other cultures.

So, the key points are: the execution, the US's diplomatic strategy, the political criticism from conservatives, and the critique of homonationalism and cultural imposition.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include the moral aspects like the tension between human rights and diplomacy, the political opportunism, and the critique of cultural imposition.

Let me structure it: start with the executions, mention the US's dilemma, then the political criticism, and finally the critique of homonationalism. Keep it concise but cover all the moral angles.

I should avoid getting too bogged down in details and focus on the main themes. Make sure to highlight the strategic importance of Iran's cooperation over the human rights issue and how this affects the administration's position.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all the essential moral points.

SUMMARY: The execution of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, highlights a moral dilemma for the U.S. administration. While the tragedy raises human rights concerns, particularly for the LGBT community, the Obama administration faces a complex geopolitical landscape. Engaging with Iran is seen as crucial for addressing nuclear issues and regional instability, such as managing the chaos in Iraq. Conservatives in the U.S., who oppose LGBT equality domestically, have criticized the administration for not doing enough to protect gay rights in Iran, exploiting the issue for political gain. This reflects a broader critique of "homonationalism," where LGBT rights are used to justify foreign policies that impose Western values on other cultures, potentially undermining local traditions. The administration is thus caught between moral imperatives and strategic interests, with little expectation of a strong response to this human rights abuse. END OF SUMMARY.
