Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about the execution of two men in Iran, possibly for being gay, and how this affects U.S. foreign policy, especially under the Obama administration. It mentions that while the executions are tragic, the U.S. is trying to engage with Iran diplomatically for bigger issues like the nuclear program and regional stability. The article also points out that conservatives in the U.S. are using this as a reason to criticize the administration's approach, which complicates things further. There's also a mention of how LGBT rights are sometimes used as a tool in foreign policy, which can have unintended consequences. 

I should focus on the key elements: who was executed, why it's significant, the U.S. stance, the political implications, and the broader issue of using LGBT rights in diplomacy. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures all these points without getting too detailed. I'll start by stating the executions, their possible cause, the administration's balancing act, the strategic importance of Iran's cooperation, the political criticism, and the complexities of using LGBT rights in foreign policy. I'll make sure to mention that the administration is cautious about addressing this issue directly because of the bigger diplomatic goals. 

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the executions, their context, the U.S. policy, the criticism from conservatives, the strategic reasons for not acting strongly, and the broader implications of using LGBT issues in foreign policy. That should cover all the main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Two men, possibly executed in Iran for consensual sodomy, highlight the Obama administration's delicate balance between promoting LGBT rights and pursuing diplomatic engagement with Iran. Despite Iran's severe human rights abuses, including over 400 executions in 2014, the U.S. prioritizes strategic cooperation with Iran to address regional instability, such as managing the chaos in Iraq and countering the Islamic State. Conservatives in the U.S. criticize the administration for not doing enough to protect LGBT rights, while progressives also condemn Iran's persecution. However, the administration faces criticism from all sides, as invoking LGBT equality in foreign policy can be seen as "homonationalism," which may inadvertently harm local cultures. The complex interplay of politics and human rights means the Obama administration is unlikely to strongly address this latest tragedy, fearing it could worsen the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
