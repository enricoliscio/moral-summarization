SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy has sparked complex reactions in the U.S., highlighting the tensions between LGBT rights and foreign policy considerations. While some conservatives in the U.S. have used Iran's poor LGBT rights record as a critique of the Obama administration's engagement policy, the administration itself is caught between upholding LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomatic agendas. Theorist Jasbir Puar calls this phenomenon "homonationalism," where LGBT equality is invoked to justify American foreign policies, even as conservatives domestically oppose LGBT equality. Additionally, Puar argues that Americans impose their conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures, hindering the tolerance of diverse sexual and gender identities that may be traditions in non-Western cultures. As a result, the Obama administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to strongly condemn the hanging of the two men in Iran, despite the tragedy, to avoid complicating delicate diplomatic efforts.
