Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. That means I need to go through the text and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "tragic," "concern," "human rights," "horrifying," etc., seem to fit here.

Next, I have to write a summary of the article. The summary needs to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. It should be concise, no longer than 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Looking at the article, it's about the execution of two men in Iran possibly for being gay and the implications for U.S. foreign policy. The moral framing is strong, with words like "tragic," "concern," "horrifying," "oppression," "engagement," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the author's moral perspective.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between human rights concerns and strategic interests. Mention the administration's tightrope walk, the conservatives' stance, and the broader implications of using LGBT issues in foreign policy. Also, touch on the critique by Jasbir Puar regarding homonationalism and cultural imposition.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and captures the main points without getting bogged down in too much detail. Keeping it under 200 words will require conciseness, but I must retain the moral elements to reflect the article's framing.

Alright, I think I have a good plan. I'll first list the morally framed words, then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
The tragic execution of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, raises moral concerns about human rights and U.S. foreign policy. While the Obama administration seeks to engage with Iran to address nuclear issues and regional instability, the execution highlights the tension between human rights advocacy and strategic interests. Conservatives in the U.S. often champion LGBT rights abroad to criticize the administration, while progressives emphasize Iran's hideous record of persecution. The article critiques the use of LGBT equality as a tool for foreign policy, noting that imposing Western conceptions of sexuality can undermine cultural traditions. The Obama administration faces criticism from all sides, but the strategic importance of Iran's cooperation outweighs the immediate moral outrage. Thus, the tragedy may not spark significant action, leaving the situation unresolved. END OF SUMMARY.
