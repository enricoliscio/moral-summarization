SUMMARY:

The hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, has sparked concerns about human rights and LGBT issues. However, the Obama administration may not take action due to its efforts to engage with the Iranian regime over nuclear and Iraq issues. The administration is walking a tightrope between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomacy with Iran. Conservatives, who typically oppose LGBT equality, are using this incident to criticize the administration's engagement policy. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies, while ignoring similar issues at home. The LGBT movement may not strongly condemn the incident, as it could perpetuate Western notions of sexuality and gender identity, and ultimately make the situation worse. The administration is caught between promoting human rights and pursuing strategic interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
