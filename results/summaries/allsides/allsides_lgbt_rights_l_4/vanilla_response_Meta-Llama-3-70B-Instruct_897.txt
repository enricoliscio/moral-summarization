SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, has sparked concerns about human rights and LGBT issues. However, the Obama administration may be hesitant to take action due to its efforts to engage with the Iranian regime on issues like nuclear diplomacy and managing chaos in Iraq. Conservatives may use this incident to criticize the administration's policy of engagement, while simultaneously opposing LGBT equality at home. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies while ignoring domestic inequalities. The administration is caught between promoting human rights and pursuing diplomatic goals, making it unlikely to raise a strong outcry over this incident. 

END OF SUMMARY.
