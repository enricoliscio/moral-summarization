SUMMARY: The hanging of two gay men in Iran presents a moral dilemma for the Obama administration, which has been attempting a delicate balance between LGBT human rights and international politics. With over 400 executions in Iran in the first half of 2014 alone, the administration's policy of engagement with Iran has come under fire from conservatives, who have suddenly become champions of gay rights. However, the complex situation in Iraq and the need for Iran's cooperation in managing the chaos caused by the Islamic State may take strategic precedence over LGBT human rights concerns. The phenomenon of "homonationalism," where LGBT equality is used to justify American foreign policies, has been criticized for imposing Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures while ignoring indigenous perspectives. Despite the horrific nature of the tragedy, the administration and the LGBT movement may be cautious in their response to avoid exacerbating the situation.
