SUMMARY:

The recent execution of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, highlights the complexities of US foreign policy and LGBT human rights. While the Obama administration has been criticized for not doing enough to defend LGBT rights, conservatives have been vocal in condemning Iran's human rights record, despite their own opposition to LGBT equality at home. This phenomenon, dubbed "homonationalism," allows conservatives to champion LGBT rights overseas while fighting them domestically. The US administration is caught between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomacy with Iran to halt its nuclear program and manage the chaos in Iraq. The execution of the two men may not spark widespread outrage, as the US LGBT movement may be wary of perpetuating Western notions of sexual and gender identity onto non-Western cultures. Ultimately, the tragedy may be met with silence, as the US administration navigates the delicate balance between human rights and international politics.
