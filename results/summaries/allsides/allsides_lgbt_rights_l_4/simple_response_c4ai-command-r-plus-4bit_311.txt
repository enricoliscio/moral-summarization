SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy has raised questions about the response of the Obama administration and the LGBT movement. While the administration has been trying to balance LGBT human rights with international politics, the executions present a challenge to their diplomatic agenda. Some conservatives in the United States, who typically oppose LGBT equality domestically, have used Iran's human rights record as a critique of the administration's engagement policy. However, the article argues that this selective concern for LGBT rights overseas is part of a phenomenon called "homonationalism," where Americans impose their conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures. This can actually inhibit tolerance for diverse forms of sexuality and gender identity that exist in non-Western cultures. As a result, the author predicts that the administration and the LGBT movement will not make a significant fuss over the recent tragedy in Iran, despite its horrifying nature.
