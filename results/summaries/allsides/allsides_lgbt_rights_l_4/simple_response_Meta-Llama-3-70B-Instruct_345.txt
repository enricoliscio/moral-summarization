SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, highlights the complexities of U.S. involvement in international LGBT human rights. While the Obama administration has been trying to engage with Iran diplomatically, the execution of these men creates a moral dilemma. Conservatives, who often oppose LGBT equality at home, may use this incident to criticize the administration's engagement policy, while liberals may be hesitant to speak out due to concerns about cultural imperialism and the imposition of Western values on non-Western cultures. The phenomenon of "homonationalism" - where LGBT equality is invoked to justify American foreign policies - raises questions about the true motives behind such actions. Ultimately, the administration may be reluctant to take a strong stance on this issue, despite its horrific nature, in order to avoid jeopardizing its diplomatic efforts.

END OF SUMMARY.
