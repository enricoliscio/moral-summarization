Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about two men being hanged in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy. It mentions that this is part of a wave of executions, over 400 in the first half of 2014. The Obama administration is trying to balance LGBT rights with international diplomacy, especially regarding Iran's nuclear program and regional issues like the Islamic State. There's some tension because conservatives in the U.S. are using this as a reason to criticize Obama's approach. The article also discusses how invoking LGBT rights in foreign policy can sometimes be a double-edged sword, leading to cultural imposition. So, the summary needs to capture the main points: the executions, the administration's balancing act, the political dynamics in the U.S., and the broader implications of using LGBT issues in foreign policy. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all these aspects. Let me try to structure it: start with the executions, mention the administration's dilemma, the political criticism, and end with the complexities of using LGBT issues in diplomacy. I should avoid getting too bogged down in details and focus on the key points.

SUMMARY: Two men in Iran were hanged, possibly for consensual sodomy, adding to a wave of executions in 2014. The Obama administration faces a dilemma between addressing LGBT rights and pursuing diplomatic engagement with Iran to manage regional issues like the Islamic State and Iran's nuclear program. Conservatives in the U.S. criticize the administration for not doing enough to protect LGBT rights, while progressives highlight Iran's human rights abuses. The article notes that invoking LGBT equality in foreign policy can sometimes lead to cultural imposition and complicate international relations. Given these complexities, the administration is unlikely to make a strong public stand on this issue. END OF SUMMARY.
