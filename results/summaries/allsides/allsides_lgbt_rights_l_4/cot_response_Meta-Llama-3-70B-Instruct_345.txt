SUMMARY:
The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, highlights the complexities of international LGBT politics. While the Obama administration has been advocating for LGBT human rights, it is also pursuing a policy of constructive engagement with Iran, which has a "hideous record" of criminalization and persecution of gay people. Conservatives, who are typically opposed to LGBT equality, are now using Iran's human rights abuses as evidence against the administration's policy. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," allows conservatives to champion LGBT rights overseas while fighting them at home. The administration is caught between promoting LGBT human rights and maintaining diplomatic relations with Iran, making it unlikely to raise a fuss over this "tragic" and "horrifying" event.
