SUMMARY: The recent hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy has sparked a debate in the U.S. about the country's response. While the Obama administration has been trying to balance LGBT human rights with international politics, conservatives in the U.S. have been quick to use Iran's human rights record as a critique of the administration's policy of engagement. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies, even as conservatives fight against LGBT equality domestically. Despite the tragic nature of the incident, the administration is caught between pursuing its diplomatic agenda and responding to human rights abuses. Critics argue that the U.S. imposition of its own conceptions of sexual and gender identity on other cultures can inhibit the tolerance of non-Western traditions of sexuality and gender identity. As a result, the administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to take a strong stance on this issue, as doing so could make the situation worse.
END OF SUMMARY.
