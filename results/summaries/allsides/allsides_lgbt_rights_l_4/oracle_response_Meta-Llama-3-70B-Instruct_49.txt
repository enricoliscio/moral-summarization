SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, sparks concerns about human rights, but may not lead to U.S. action. The Obama administration is walking a tightrope between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomacy with Iran. Despite Iran's state anti-Semitism, arrest of U.S. journalists, and oppression of women, the administration seeks constructive engagement to halt Iran's nuclear program. The execution of two gay men doesn't make this engagement easier, especially as Iran's cooperation is crucial in managing the chaos in Iraq and the Islamic State. Conservatives may claim otherwise, but in international LGBT politics, Iran's record on homosexuality is often used to justify hawkish foreign policies. The phenomenon of "homonationalism" allows conservatives to champion gay rights overseas while fighting them at home. The Obama administration and LGBT movement may not raise a hue and cry over this tragedy, as demanding tolerance of "homosexuality" can inhibit tolerance of indigenous forms of sexuality and gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
