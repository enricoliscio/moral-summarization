Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the execution of two men in Iran, possibly for being gay, and how this affects U.S. foreign policy. The Obama administration is trying to engage with Iran for strategic reasons, like dealing with ISIS and Iraq's instability, but this execution complicates things. Conservatives are using the issue to criticize the administration's policy.

I need to highlight the moral issues: executions, human rights, oppression, etc. I should mention the tightrope the administration is walking between human rights and diplomacy. Also, note how conservatives use the issue for political gain, which adds another layer of moral complexity.

I'll structure the summary to include the key events, the administration's dilemma, the political implications, and the broader moral issues like homonationalism and cultural imposition. I'll make sure to use words like "hanging," "executed," "oppression," "tragedy," and "travesty."

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll also make sure the summary flows logically, connecting the execution to the diplomatic challenges and the political debate in the U.S.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure to include all the necessary moral elements and key points from the article.

SUMMARY:  
The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, highlights a moral dilemma for the U.S. administration. While the executions are part of a wave of over 400 in 2014, their potential persecution for being gay adds complexity to U.S. foreign policy. The Obama administration, pursuing a policy of constructive engagement with Iran to address nuclear concerns and regional instability, faces criticism from conservatives who use the executions to attack its approach. Conservatives, who often oppose LGBT rights domestically, suddenly champion them internationally to undermine the administration. This creates a moral conflict, as the administration balances human rights concerns with strategic interests, such as managing chaos in Iraq and countering the Islamic State. The article also critiques how U.S. foreign policy often imposes Western notions of sexuality, potentially inhibiting tolerance of non-Western gender and sexual identities. Thus, while the executions are a horrifying tragedy, the administration is unlikely to prioritize this issue, fearing it could worsen the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
