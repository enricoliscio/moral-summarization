SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy has sparked moral outrage and highlighted the complex dynamics of LGBT rights in foreign policy. While the Obama administration walks a tightrope between LGBT human rights and international politics, conservatives in the United States use Iran's persecution of gay people to criticize the administration's engagement policy. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies while ignoring indigenous conceptions of sexuality and gender in non-Western cultures. The author suggests that the Obama administration and the LGBT movement may refrain from publicly condemning this tragedy to avoid exacerbating tensions and hindering diplomatic efforts. However, the article also emphasizes the moral dilemma and the potential for conservatives to champion LGBT rights overseas while opposing them domestically.
