SUMMARY:

The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, has sparked concerns about human rights. However, the Obama administration's efforts to address LGBT concerns may be hindered by its attempts to engage with the Iranian regime. The administration has been walking a tightrope between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomacy to halt Iran's nuclear program. The execution of the two men, part of a wave of over 400 executions in Iran this year, could further complicate this delicate balance. Conservatives, who often oppose LGBT equality at home, may use this incident to criticize the administration's engagement policy. This phenomenon, dubbed "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies, while perpetuating the myth that sexual diversity is a Western invention. The Obama administration and LGBT movement may be reluctant to raise a hue and cry over this tragedy, fearing it could make the situation worse. END OF SUMMARY.
