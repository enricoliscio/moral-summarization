Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the execution of two men in Iran, which ties into U.S. foreign policy and the complexities of human rights advocacy.

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. The user has specified two steps: Step 1 is to identify all the single words that are morally framed, and Step 2 is to write a summary preserving those moral frames. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and include the morally framed words.

I should start by reading the article carefully. The article discusses the execution of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, and how this affects U.S. policy. It mentions the Obama administration's balancing act between human rights and diplomatic engagement with Iran. There's also a discussion about how conservative U.S. politicians use this issue to criticize the administration, while progressive groups focus on human rights. The author also critiques the concept of homonationalism, where certain groups use LGBTQ rights for political gain, potentially harming local cultures.

For Step 1, I need to extract all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong moral connotation, such as 'tragic,' 'hanging,''sodomites,' 'concern,' 'action,' 'petition,' 'human rights,' 'immoral villains,' 'oppression,' 'execution,' 'gay,' 'LGBT,' 'equality,' 'homonationalism,' 'imperialism,' 'tolerance,' 'Western invention,' 'travesty,' 'justice,' 'horrifying,' 'tragedy,' and 'worse.'

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include these moral terms. I should highlight the conflict between human rights advocacy and strategic diplomacy, the political利用 of the issue by different groups, and the critique of Western imposition of LGBTQ rights.

I should ensure the summary is clear and within the word limit. I'll start by stating the executions, the moral implications, the administration's dilemma, the political利用, and the broader critique. I'll end by noting the lack of expected outcry.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate without making the summary too verbose. I need to maintain the essence of the article's moral framing without adding personal opinions, just presenting the facts with the moral language preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  
The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, raises moral concerns about human rights and U.S. foreign policy. While the executions highlight Iran’s oppressive treatment of LGBT individuals, the Obama administration faces a dilemma between advocating for human rights and pursuing diplomatic engagement with Iran to address broader strategic interests, such as nuclear proliferation and regional stability. Conservatives in the U.S. have used Iran’s human rights abuses, including the persecution of gay people, to criticize the administration’s policy of engagement, creating a politically charged environment. However, progressives and moral advocates argue that invoking LGBT rights as a tool for foreign policy can perpetuate Western imperialism and ignore indigenous cultural contexts. As a result, the Obama administration and the LGBT movement may remain cautious in responding to this latest travesty of justice, fearing that intervention could worsen the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
