SUMMARY:

The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, highlights the complexities of US foreign policy and LGBT human rights. Despite Iran's state antisemitism, oppression of women, and recent arrest of US journalists, the Obama administration has been pursuing a policy of constructive engagement to halt Iran's nuclear program. However, this execution, part of a wave of over 400 in the first half of 2014, could make this engagement more difficult. Conservatives may claim that the administration is not doing enough to defend LGBT rights, while liberals may be hesitant to raise a hue and cry due to concerns about "homonationalism" and cultural imperialism. The execution is a travesty of justice, but the US may need to prioritize strategic interests over human rights in this case. The Obama administration is caught between promoting LGBT human rights and managing the chaos in Iraq and the Islamic State. END OF SUMMARY.
