SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for suspected consensual sodomy presents a moral dilemma for the Obama administration, which has been attempting a delicate balance between LGBT human rights and international politics in its engagement with the country. While the administration has been pursuing a policy of constructive engagement with Iran to halt its nuclear program and manage the chaos in Iraq, the country's record of human rights abuses, including the persecution of gay people, complicates this approach. Conservatives in the United States have been quick to criticize the administration for not doing enough to defend LGBT rights in Iran, despite their own opposition to LGBT equality at home. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies while ignoring or perpetuating human rights abuses that do not align with Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity. As a result, the Obama administration and the LGBT movement are faced with a difficult choice: speaking out against Iran's actions and potentially making the situation worse, or remaining silent and compromising their commitment to human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
