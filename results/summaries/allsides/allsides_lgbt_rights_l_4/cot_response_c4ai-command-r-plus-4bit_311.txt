SUMMARY: The tragic hanging of two sodomites in Iran presents a moral cause for concern and action. While the exact reason for their execution remains unclear, it is part of a wave of executions in Iran that raises serious questions about human rights violations. The Obama administration finds itself in a moral dilemma, balancing LGBT human rights with international politics and the need for engagement with Iran to halt its nuclear program and manage the chaos in Iraq. Conservatives who favor a hawkish foreign policy criticize the administration for not doing enough to defend LGBT rights in Iran, despite their domestic opposition to LGBT equality. This phenomenon, known as homonationalism, highlights the selective use of LGBT rights as a justification for American foreign policies. While the Obama administration and the LGBT movement may be hesitant to raise a strong reaction to these executions for strategic reasons, the underlying immoral and inhumane treatment of individuals in Iran remains a serious concern.
