SUMMARY: Two men, Abdullah Ghavami Chahzanjiru and Salman Ghanbari Chahzanjiri, were hanged in Iran on August 6, possibly for consensual sodomy. Their deaths add to a growing list of executions in Iran, with over 400 taking place in just the first half of 2014. While the Obama administration has been trying to balance LGBT human rights with international politics, these executions present a challenging dilemma. Conservatives in the United States who oppose LGBT equality at home are quick to criticize the administration for not doing enough to defend gay rights abroad, especially in Iran. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies. However, by imposing Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity, Americans may inadvertently inhibit the tolerance of non-Western forms of sexual and gender identity. As a result, the administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to make a strong stand against these executions, despite the horrifying nature of the tragedy.
END OF SUMMARY.
