SUMMARY: 
The tragic hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy raises moral concerns for the United States. While the Obama administration grapples with a delicate diplomatic agenda, conservatives in the U.S. suddenly champion LGBT rights abroad, bashing the administration for not doing enough. This phenomenon, termed "homonationalism," sees conservatives fight for LGBT equality overseas while opposing it domestically. The article critiques the imposition of Western conceptions of sexuality and gender, which may inhibit tolerance for indigenous forms. Despite the horrifying travesty of justice in Iran, the administration's dicey engagement with Iran over its nuclear program and the chaos in Iraq may take strategic precedence, risking further tragedy.
