SUMMARY: The tragic hanging of two sodomites in Iran has sparked a moral dilemma for the United States. While the Obama administration has been attempting a rapprochement with Iran to halt its nuclear program and manage the chaos in Iraq, the hanging of two men, possibly for consensual sodomy, highlights Iran's hideous record of criminalization and repression of LGBT individuals. Conservatives in the United States, who typically oppose LGBT equality at home, suddenly become defenders of gay rights overseas, bashing the administration for not doing enough. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," reveals the hypocrisy of invoking LGBT equality to justify foreign policy agendas while ignoring or inhibiting tolerance and diversity in non-Western cultures. As horrifying as this tragedy is, the complexities of international politics may limit the Obama administration's response to avoid making the situation worse.
