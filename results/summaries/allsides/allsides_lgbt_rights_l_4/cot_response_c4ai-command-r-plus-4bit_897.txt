SUMMARY: The tragic hanging of two sodomites in Iran presents a moral cause for concern and action for the United States. While the exact reason for their execution remains uncertain, their deaths are part of a wave of executions in Iran, with over 400 in the first half of 2014 alone. The Obama administration finds itself in a delicate situation, trying to balance its commitment to human rights with its pursuit of diplomatic engagement with Iran. Conservatives have seized on this issue, criticizing the administration for not doing enough to stand up for LGBT rights overseas. The phenomenon of invoking LGBT equality to justify foreign policies, known as "homonationalism," has been used by conservatives to further their agenda while ignoring domestic equality issues. Despite the moral outrage, practical considerations may prevent the administration and the LGBT movement from taking action on this issue, for fear of making the situation worse.
