SUMMARY:
The tragic hanging of two sodomites in Iran is a cause for concern and action. As reported, the two men were hanged and possibly executed for consensual sodomy, adding to Iran's already hideous record of criminalization and persecution of LGBT individuals. This presents a headache for the Obama administration, which is trying to walk a tightrope between LGBT human rights and international politics. The administration is pursuing a policy of constructive engagement with Iran, despite its state anti-Semitism, arrest of journalists, and oppression of women. With over 400 executions in the first half of 2014 alone, the administration's efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program through diplomacy instead of military action are difficult. Iran's cooperation is also deemed essential in managing the chaos in Iraq and the Islamic State, making strategic importance a higher priority than human rights abuse. In the complex world of international LGBT politics, Iran's record on homosexuality is used as a conservative cause to bash the Obama administration's engagement policy. While some conservatives may genuinely support LGBT equality, they are selective in their defense of human rights, and routinely criticize Iran's repression of gays and lesbians. The administration finds itself caught between conservatives enamored with gay rights and those who oppose its diplomatic agenda. The phenomenon of invoking LGBT equality to justify foreign policies, known as homonationalism, has been criticized for imposing Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures, potentially inhibiting the tolerance of indigenous forms of sexual and gender expression. As a result, the administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to raise a strong reaction to this latest travesty of justice, despite its horrifying nature.
