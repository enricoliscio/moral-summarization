SUMMARY: The hanging of two "sodomites" in Iran presents a moral dilemma for the U.S. administration, which has been attempting a rapprochement with Iran to halt its nuclear program and manage the chaos in Iraq. While conservatives in the U.S. who oppose LGBT equality at home suddenly champion gay rights abroad, the administration is caught between its diplomatic agenda and human rights concerns. The article suggests that invoking LGBT equality to justify foreign policies, known as "homonationalism," can be problematic as it imposes Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures. The author argues that the administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to strongly condemn the executions to avoid making the situation worse. This tragedy highlights the complex moral calculations in international relations, where strategic interests often take precedence over human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
