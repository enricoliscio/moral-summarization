SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, raises concerns about human rights and LGBT equality. However, the Obama administration's efforts to engage with Iran diplomatically may be hindered by this incident, as it prioritizes strategic cooperation over human rights issues. Ironically, conservatives who oppose LGBT equality at home may use this incident to criticize the administration's policy of engagement. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies, while ignoring indigenous ways of thinking about sexuality and gender. The LGBT movement may not strongly condemn this incident, as it may perpetuate the myth that sexual diversity is a Western invention and inhibit tolerance of non-Western forms of sexuality and gender identity.

END OF SUMMARY.
