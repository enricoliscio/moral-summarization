SUMMARY: Two men were recently hanged in Iran for suspected consensual sodomy. Their execution is part of a wave of executions in the country, with over 400 taking place in the first half of 2014 alone. While their exact "crimes" are unclear, their hanging is a tragic example of the persecution and repression of LGBT individuals in Iran.

The Obama administration's response to this incident is complicated by its attempts at rapprochement with Iran over its nuclear program and the need for cooperation in managing the chaos in Iraq and the threat of the Islamic State. Conservatives in the United States, who typically oppose LGBT equality at home, suddenly champion gay rights when criticizing the administration's foreign policy. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves using LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies.

However, this can also inhibit the tolerance of diverse forms of sexuality and gender identity in non-Western cultures. As a result, the administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to make a significant fuss over this latest travesty of justice, despite its horrifying nature. END OF SUMMARY.
