SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, has sparked concerns about human rights and LGBT issues. However, the Obama administration may not take action due to its efforts to engage with the Iranian regime over its nuclear program and cooperation in managing the chaos in Iraq. Conservatives may use this incident to criticize the administration's policy of engagement, while also hypocritically championing LGBT rights overseas despite opposing them at home. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," can perpetuate the myth that sexual diversity is a Western invention and inhibit tolerance of non-Western forms of sexuality and gender identity. As a result, the administration and the LGBT movement may not raise a strong outcry over this incident, despite its horrific nature.

END OF SUMMARY.
