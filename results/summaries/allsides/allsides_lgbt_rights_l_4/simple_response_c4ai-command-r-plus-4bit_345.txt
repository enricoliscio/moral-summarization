SUMMARY: The hanging of two “sodomites” in Iran presents a moral dilemma for the U.S. government and the LGBT movement. On the one hand, these executions are a clear violation of human rights and should be condemned. On the other hand, the Obama administration is trying to balance LGBT human rights with international politics, particularly its diplomatic agenda with Iran. While conservatives in the U.S. who typically oppose LGBT equality at home are quick to defend it overseas, their motivation is often more about bashing the Obama administration than a genuine concern for LGBT rights. The administration finds itself caught between competing interests and criticisms from all sides. Furthermore, the imposition of Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures can inhibit the tolerance of indigenous forms of sexual and gender diversity. As a result, the tragic hanging of these two men in Iran may not receive the attention and outrage it deserves from the U.S. government and the LGBT movement, as any intervention could potentially make the situation worse.
END OF SUMMARY.
