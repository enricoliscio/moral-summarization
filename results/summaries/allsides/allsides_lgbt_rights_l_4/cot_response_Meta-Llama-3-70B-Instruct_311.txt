SUMMARY:
The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, has sparked a moral dilemma for the Obama administration. While the execution is a horrific human rights abuse, the administration is walking a tightrope between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomacy with Iran. Conservatives, who typically oppose LGBT equality, are now enamored of gay rights and criticizing the administration for not doing enough to defend them. This phenomenon, dubbed "homonationalism," is problematic as it can perpetuate Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity, inhibiting tolerance of indigenous forms of sexuality and gender identity. The administration is thus caught between its dicey diplomatic agenda and the need to address the horrifying tragedy of these executions. END OF SUMMARY.
