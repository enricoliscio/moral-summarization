SUMMARY:
The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, highlights the complexities of international LGBT politics. While the Obama administration has been trying to walk a tightrope between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomacy with Iran, conservatives are now using this incident to bash the administration's policy of engagement. This is a case of "homonationalism," where conservatives champion LGBT equality overseas while fighting it at home. The administration is caught between its desire to promote human rights and its need to cooperate with Iran on issues like Iraq and nuclear proliferation. The tragic execution of these two men may not spark a strong response from the LGBT movement, as it could be counterproductive and perpetuate a form of "imperialism" that imposes Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures. END OF SUMMARY.
