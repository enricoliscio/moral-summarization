Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, they want me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. They mentioned this as "STEP 1:" and each word should be listed with a *. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "tragic," "concern," "human rights," "execution," etc., come to mind. I should make sure I don't miss any and list them all.

Next, after identifying those words, I need to write a summary of the article. The summary must preserve as many of those morally framed words as possible. It should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." and be under 200 words. I have to ensure that the moral framing is maintained, so I'll focus on the key points: the executions, the administration's dilemma, the political implications, and the critique of homonationalism.

I should also consider the user's deeper needs. They might be looking for a concise yet comprehensive summary that highlights the moral issues without losing the context. They could be using this for an academic purpose or to understand the complexities of international relations and human rights.

I need to make sure the summary flows well, covers all main points, and uses the identified moral terms appropriately. I'll start by outlining the main events: the executions, the administration's tightrope between rights and politics, the strategic importance of Iran's cooperation, and the critique of using LGBT issues for political gain. Then, I'll tie it all together, showing why the administration isn't making a big fuss despite the tragedy.

Finally, I'll double-check the word count to ensure it's within 200 words and that all key moral points are included. I'll also make sure the summary is clear and concise, capturing the essence of the article without unnecessary details.

### SUMMARY:  
The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, highlights the moral dilemma faced by the Obama administration in balancing LGBT human rights with strategic international politics. While Iran's execution of homosexuals is a human rights concern, the administration is cautious to avoid complicating its diplomatic efforts to engage with Iran on nuclear issues and regional stability, such as managing the chaos in Iraq. Conservatives in the U.S. often invoke LGBT rights to criticize the administration's policy of engagement, creating a political double-bind. The article critiques the phenomenon of "homonationalism," where LGBT equality is used selectively to justify foreign policies, often imposing Western norms on other cultures. Given these complexities, the administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to make a strong public stand on this tragedy, fearing it could exacerbate the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
