SUMMARY:
The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, highlights the Obama administration's delicate balance between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing international politics. While the execution is a "tragic" and "horrifying" event, the administration's efforts to engage with Iran's regime may be hindered by this incident. Conservatives, who often oppose LGBT equality domestically, are quick to condemn Iran's "hideous" record on homosexuality, using it as evidence against the administration's policy of engagement. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," allows conservatives to champion LGBT rights overseas while fighting them at home. The administration is thus caught between promoting human rights and pursuing diplomacy, making it unlikely to raise a strong outcry over this "travesty of justice." END OF SUMMARY.
