SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy presents a moral dilemma for the Obama administration, which has been pursuing a policy of engagement with the country. While the administration has been trying to balance LGBT human rights with international politics, the executions highlight the complex nature of U.S.-Iran relations and the challenges of promoting LGBT equality in a foreign policy context. Conservatives in the United States, who typically oppose LGBT rights domestically, have been quick to criticize the Obama administration for not doing enough to defend LGBT rights in Iran. This phenomenon, known as "homonationalism," involves using LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies while ignoring or suppressing indigenous conceptions of sexuality and gender in non-Western cultures. As a result, the Obama administration and the LGBT movement are faced with a difficult choice: speaking out against the executions and potentially making the situation worse, or remaining silent and appearing complicit in the face of a moral atrocity.
