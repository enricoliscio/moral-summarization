SUMMARY:
The tragic hanging of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, has sparked a moral dilemma for the Obama administration. Despite Iran's hideous record of human rights abuses, including oppression of women and state anti-Semitism, the administration has been pursuing a policy of constructive engagement to halt Iran's nuclear program. However, this latest execution, which is part of a wave of over 400 in the first half of 2014, may make this engagement more difficult. Conservatives, who are typically opposed to LGBT equality, are now using Iran's human rights record as a justification for a hawkish foreign policy, while liberals are hesitant to raise a hue and cry over the tragedy, fearing it may only make things worse. The incident highlights the complexities of international LGBT politics and the dangers of "homonationalism," where LGBT equality is used as a justification for American foreign policies.
