SUMMARY: The hanging of two men in Iran for alleged consensual sodomy has raised concerns about LGBT rights in the country. This incident highlights the Obama administration's delicate balance between LGBT human rights and international politics, particularly in its attempts to engage with Iran diplomatically and manage the situation in Iraq. Conservatives in the United States have been quick to criticize the administration for not doing enough to defend LGBT rights in Iran, despite their domestic opposition to LGBT equality. Theorist Jasbir Puar calls this phenomenon "homonationalism," where LGBT equality is used to justify American foreign policies. However, imposing Western conceptions of sexuality and gender identity on other cultures can inhibit the tolerance of indigenous ways of thinking about sexuality and gender. As a result, the Obama administration and the LGBT movement may choose to remain cautious in their response to this tragedy to avoid making the situation worse.
END OF SUMMARY.
