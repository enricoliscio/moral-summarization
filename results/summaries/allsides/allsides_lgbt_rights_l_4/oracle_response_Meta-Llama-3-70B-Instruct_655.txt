SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, has sparked a moral dilemma for the Obama administration. Despite Iran's appalling human rights record, including over 400 executions in the first half of 2014, the administration has been pursuing a policy of constructive engagement to halt Iran's nuclear program. However, this tragic event has put the administration in a tight spot, as it tries to balance LGBT human rights with international politics. Conservatives, who often oppose LGBT equality at home, are now using Iran's persecution of gays as evidence against the administration's engagement policy. This phenomenon, dubbed "homonationalism," allows conservatives to champion LGBT rights overseas while fighting them domestically. The administration is caught between a rock and a hard place, as it tries to navigate this complex issue without making things worse. The tragic deaths of these two men have become a pawn in a larger game of international politics, and it remains to be seen how the administration will respond.

END OF SUMMARY.
