Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article talks about the execution of two men in Iran possibly for being gay and how it affects US foreign policy. The author is critical of how the US handles this issue, pointing out that while the executions are tragic, the administration is focused on bigger strategic goals like dealing with Iran's nuclear program and the Islamic State. They mention that conservatives in the US are suddenly concerned about gay rights to criticize the Obama administration, which creates a tough spot for the administration. Also, the author brings up how Western ideas about sexuality might not fit other cultures, so pushing for LGBT rights could backfire. So, the summary should capture the conflict between human rights and strategic interests, the political dynamics in the US, and the cultural implications. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The execution of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual homosexuality, highlights the tension between U.S. human rights concerns and strategic foreign policy interests. While the Obama administration seeks to engage with Iran to address nuclear proliferation and regional instability, the execution underscores the moral dilemma of prioritizing diplomatic ties over human rights abuses. Conservatives in the U.S. have used Iran's persecution of gays to criticize the administration, creating a politically charged environment. The article critiques the use of LGBT rights as a tool for foreign policy, arguing that Western imposition of sexual norms can disrupt indigenous cultural practices. As a result, the administration faces criticism from all sides, making it difficult to address the tragedy without worsening the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
