SUMMARY:

The recent hanging of two men in Iran, allegedly for consensual sodomy, may not spark widespread outrage from the US government or LGBT advocates. Despite the tragedy, the Obama administration is walking a tightrope between promoting LGBT human rights and pursuing diplomatic engagement with Iran to address its nuclear program and cooperation in managing the Iraq crisis. Conservatives may seize on the issue to criticize the administration's policy of engagement, while liberals may be hesitant to raise a fuss due to concerns about "homonationalism" - the phenomenon of invoking LGBT equality to justify American foreign policies. This could lead to the imposition of Western conceptions of sexual and gender identity on other cultures, stifling indigenous traditions. As a result, the Obama administration and LGBT movement may not make a strong statement on the issue, despite its horrific nature.

END OF SUMMARY.
