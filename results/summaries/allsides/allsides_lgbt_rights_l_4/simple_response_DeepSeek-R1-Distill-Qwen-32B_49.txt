Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned I'm a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The article is about the execution of two men in Iran and the US's response, or lack thereof.

First, I need to read the article carefully. It talks about the executions, the Obama administration's policy towards Iran, and how this affects their diplomatic efforts. The moral angle is about human rights versus strategic interests.

I should identify the key points: the executions, the uncertainty about the reason, the administration's tightrope between human rights and diplomacy, Iran's cooperation in other areas, and the political implications in the US.

Also, the article mentions how conservatives use this issue to criticize the administration, highlighting the irony of their stance on LGBT rights domestically versus internationally.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral dilemma and the strategic considerations without being too long. Keeping it under 200 words is important.

I'll structure it by first stating the executions, then the administration's dilemma, the strategic importance of Iran's cooperation, the political criticism, and the broader implications of using LGBT rights in foreign policy.

I should avoid getting bogged down in too much detail and focus on the main moral and political points. Also, ensure that the summary reflects the author's framing, which seems critical of the administration's approach and the selective use of human rights issues by politicians.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is concise and flows well, ending with the note about not expecting a strong reaction from the administration or the movement.

SUMMARY:  
The execution of two men in Iran, potentially for consensual sodomy, highlights a moral and political dilemma for the U.S. administration. While the deaths raise concerns about LGBT rights, they occur amid broader strategic priorities, such as Iran's nuclear program and regional stability. The Obama administration, pursuing a policy of engagement with Iran, faces criticism from conservatives who use the executions to attack its foreign policy. Meanwhile, progressives also condemn Iran's human rights abuses but are cautious about entangling human rights advocacy with geopolitical interests. The article underscores the complexities of using LGBT rights as a tool in foreign policy, noting how conservative voices in the U.S. selectively champion gay rights abroad while opposing them domestically. Additionally, it critiques the imposition of Western sexual norms on other cultures, potentially undermining indigenous understandings of sexuality. Given these dynamics, the administration and the LGBT movement are unlikely to make this issue a focal point, fearing it could worsen the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
