Okay, I need to tackle this query. The user provided a news article and wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identify all single words with moral framing, and second, write a summary preserving those moral frames.

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "tragic," "concern," "human rights," "execution," "oppression," "cooperation," "strategic importance," "horrifying," etc., stand out as they relate to moral judgments or ethical issues.

For the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping those moral terms. The article talks about the executions in Iran, the administration's dilemma between human rights and diplomacy, and the political implications. I should highlight the moral conflict, the strategic importance, and the complexities involved without taking sides.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many moral words as possible. I'll structure it to mention the executions, the administration's tightrope, the political context, the conservative vs. progressive stances, and the broader implications of homonationalism.

I should also make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without losing the moral framing. Avoiding markdown, I'll present it clearly after the "SUMMARY:" token.

**STEP 1:**  
* Tragic  
* Concern  
* Action  
* Petition  
* Human rights  
* Executions  
* Oppression  
* Immoral  
* Villains  
* Headache  
* Tightrope  
* Engagement  
* Anti-Semitism  
* Arrest  
* Cooperation  
* Chaos  
* Essential  
* Strategic importance  
* Hawkish  
* Hideous  
* Criminalization  
* Persecution  
* Enamored  
* Bash  
* Hue and cry  
* Travesty  
* Justice  
* Horrifying  

**SUMMARY:**  
The tragic executions of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, highlight a moral dilemma for the U.S. administration. While human rights concerns, particularly for LGBT individuals, are pressing, the Obama administration is navigating a delicate balance between promoting equality and pursuing diplomatic engagement with Iran to address broader strategic interests, such as nuclear policy and regional stability. Conservatives in the U.S. have seized on Iran’s persecution of gays as a tool to criticize the administration’s foreign policy, while progressives also condemn Iran’s oppression. However, the article suggests that invoking LGBT rights in foreign policy can perpetuate cultural imperialism and obscure indigenous sexual and gender identities. Given these complexities, the administration and the LGBT movement may remain cautious in responding to this latest travesty of justice, fearing that intervention could exacerbate the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
