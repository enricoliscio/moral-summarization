Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the tragic hanging of two men in Iran and the U.S. response. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

The article starts by talking about the execution of two men, Abdullah Ghavami Chahzanjiru and Salman Ghanbari Chahzanjiri, in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy. It mentions that there have been over 400 executions in Iran so far in 2014. The uncertainty about their exact crimes is noted, with some sources saying they were gay, others being vague but calling them immoral.

The main point is that while this execution is a human rights issue, especially for the LGBT community, the U.S. is in a tough spot. The Obama administration is trying to engage with Iran diplomatically, especially regarding their nuclear program and regional issues like the chaos in Iraq. The article points out that conservatives in the U.S. might use this as a reason to oppose the administration's policy, but the administration is trying to balance human rights concerns with broader strategic interests.

There's also a discussion about how in international LGBT politics, Iran's treatment of gays is sometimes used by conservatives in the U.S. to criticize the administration. The article mentions the concept of "homonationalism," where certain groups use LGBT rights to justify foreign policies, sometimes at the expense of understanding local cultural contexts.

So, the summary needs to capture that the executions happened, the uncertainty around their cause, the strategic dilemma for the U.S., and how this issue is being used politically in the U.S. Also, the broader implications of using LGBT rights in foreign policy.

I should make sure to mention the tightrope the Obama administration is walking between human rights and diplomacy. Also, the fact that while the executions are tragic, the U.S. might not make it a priority due to other strategic concerns.

I should also touch on the irony that conservatives who oppose LGBT rights domestically might use this to criticize the administration's foreign policy. And the concept that promoting Western ideas of sexual identity might not align with local traditions, potentially causing more harm.

Putting it all together, the summary should be concise, under 200 words, and cover these key points.

SUMMARY: The execution of two men in Iran, possibly for consensual sodomy, highlights a complex dilemma for the U.S. government. While the Obama administration is engaged in diplomatic efforts with Iran to address nuclear concerns and regional instability, the tragic event raises human rights issues, particularly for the LGBT community. Conservatives in the U.S. may criticize the administration for not prioritizing gay rights, even as they oppose such rights domestically. The article discusses the strategic challenges of balancing human rights concerns with broader diplomatic goals, noting that Iran's cooperation is crucial for managing regional conflicts. The use of LGBT rights as a political tool, known as "homonationalism," is critiqued for potentially imposing Western norms on other cultures. Given these complexities, the administration faces criticism from all sides, making it unlikely to prioritize this case over strategic interests. END OF SUMMARY.
