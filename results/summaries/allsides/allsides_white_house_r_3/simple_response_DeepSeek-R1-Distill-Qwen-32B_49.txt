Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the terrorist attacks in Paris by ISIS, which happened just 12 hours after President Obama said ISIS was contained. That's a key point because it sets up a moral critique of Obama's statement. The attacks resulted in many deaths, and Hollande called it an act of war. Obama's comments were that ISIS wasn't gaining strength, but the attacks suggest otherwise. There's also mention of the U.S. and France working together against ISIS, and Obama's past criticism for downplaying ISIS's threat.

The summary needs to capture the timing of the attacks relative to Obama's statement, the casualties, Hollande's response, Obama's defense, the criticism from his past remarks, and the ongoing efforts against ISIS. I should make sure to include the moral angle, which is the contrast between Obama's claims and the actual attacks, highlighting the potential failure of containment.

I should structure the summary to first mention the attacks and their timing, then Obama's statement, the criticism, the consequences, and the international response. Keeping it concise, under 200 words, while making sure all key points are included.

Let me try to draft that, ensuring I don't miss any crucial details and maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, resulting in 127 deaths and many injuries, just 12 hours after President Obama declared the group "contained." French President Hollande labeled the attacks an "act of war," while Obama maintained that ISIS was not gaining strength and had been contained. Critics pointed out the contradiction between Obama's claims and the severity of the attacks. The U.S. and France are part of a coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and Obama emphasized progress in reducing foreign fighters. The attacks raised concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks. Obama criticized in 2014 for calling ISIS a "jayvee team" faced renewed scrutiny. The attacks may be the second major one by ISIS in two weeks, following the downing of a Russian plane. Obama offered condolences to France and pledged support, while Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit. Obama will review intelligence before the summit. END OF SUMMARY.
