SUMMARY:
The terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by the Islamic State and resulting in at least 127 dead and many wounded, came just hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained". The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the shootings and bombings, with French President Hollande blaming them for "an act of war". Obama rejected the notion that the group was gaining strength and expressed that they had been contained. Security officials have been concerned about the potential threat of French citizens who joined the extremist group returning to France. The Paris killings are the second major attack by the Islamic State in recent weeks, following the downing of a Russian plane in the Sinai peninsula. Obama offered his condolences to Hollande and reaffirmed the United States' unwavering support for France, their oldest ally and friend. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders, including Obama, were to discuss the fight against the Islamic State, the Syrian civil war, and the refugee crisis. Obama pledged to work with Hollande and other nations to defeat the scourge of terrorism.
