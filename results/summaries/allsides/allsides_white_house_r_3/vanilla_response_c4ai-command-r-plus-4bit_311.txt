SUMMARY: The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks in Paris that left at least 127 people dead, just hours after President Obama declared the group "contained." The attacks prompted French President Francois Hollande to blame the Islamic State for "an act of war." In an interview, Obama rejected the notion that the group was gaining strength, stating that they have been contained and have not gained ground in Iraq and Syria. Security officials have raised concerns about French citizens joining the extremist group and returning to carry out attacks. The Paris killings are the second major attack by the Islamic State in two weeks, following the downing of a Russian plane in Egypt. Obama offered condolences to Hollande and reaffirmed the US's support in the fight against terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, while Obama is still scheduled to attend and will review intelligence surrounding the Paris attacks with his National Security Council.
END OF SUMMARY.
