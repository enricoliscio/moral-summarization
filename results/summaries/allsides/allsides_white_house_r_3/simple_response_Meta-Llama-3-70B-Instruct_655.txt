SUMMARY:

In a stark contrast to President Obama's declaration that the Islamic State had been "contained," the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the devastating attacks in Paris that left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The President's statement, made just 12 hours prior to the attacks, downplayed the group's strength, saying "I don't think they're gaining strength." However, the attacks in Paris, as well as the downing of a Russian passenger plane, suggest otherwise. The French President, Francois Hollande, rightfully labeled the attacks "an act of war." The incident highlights the importance of humility and accuracy in assessing the threat of terrorism, rather than downplaying it. It also underscores the need for international cooperation to combat this scourge. President Obama has since offered condolences to the French people and reiterated the US's commitment to defeating terrorism.
