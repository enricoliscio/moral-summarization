Okay, so the user has given me a news article about the Paris terrorist attacks and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. Hmm, the article talks about the timing of the attacks right after Obama declared ISIS contained. I need to make sure the summary highlights that contrast because it's a key moral point. 

First, I'll read through the article again to catch all the main points. The attacks happened 12 hours after Obama's statement, which is a big deal. Hollande called it an act of war, and Obama's previous comments are being criticized again. Also, the mention of the Russian plane crash adds context about ISIS's recent activities.

I should start the summary by noting the timing of the attacks relative to Obama's declaration. Then mention the casualties and Hollande's response. It's important to include Obama's defense of the containment strategy and his criticism from earlier in 2014. The connection to the Russian plane crash shows ISIS's reach, which adds to the moral framing of their threat.

I also need to include the G-20 summit cancellation and Obama's plans to discuss the situation. This shows the international response and the ongoing efforts against terrorism. Keeping it under 200 words, I'll make sure each point is concise but covers all necessary elements without losing the moral context.

Let me structure it: start with the attack and its timing, then Hollande's statement, Obama's response, the criticism, the Russian plane, and the international reactions. That should cover all the key moral points and the implications of the events.

SUMMARY: The terrorist attacks in Paris, claimed by the Islamic State (ISIS), occurred just 12 hours after President Obama stated that the extremist group had been "contained." The attacks, which killed at least 127 people and injured many more, were described by French President Francois Hollande as "an act of war." Obama defended his assertion, arguing that ISIS had not gained strength and that the U.S.-led coalition had successfully contained the group. However, the timing of the attacks has drawn criticism, as they come after Obama's claim and follow the downing of a Russian passenger plane by ISIS in Sinai two weeks earlier. The attacks have also raised concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks in France. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where he was to discuss the fight against ISIS with Obama and other leaders. Obama, who is heading to the summit, will review intelligence on the Paris attacks before departing. The U.S. has reaffirmed its support for France in the wake of the tragedy, emphasizing the need for a global effort to combat terrorism. END OF SUMMARY.
