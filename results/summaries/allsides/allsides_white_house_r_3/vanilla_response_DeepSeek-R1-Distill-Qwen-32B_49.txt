Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about the Paris terrorist attacks by ISIS, which happened just after President Obama declared ISIS contained. 

Okay, key points: The attacks occurred 12 hours after Obama's statement. ISIS claimed responsibility, causing 127 deaths and many injuries. French President Hollande called it an act of war. Obama said ISIS isn't gaining strength and that they've been contained. He dismissed the idea that ISIS is getting stronger, mentioning their lack of territorial gains in Iraq and Syria.

Also, there's concern about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks. Obama was criticized earlier for downplaying ISIS. The Paris attacks are the second major one in two weeks, with the Russian plane downing in Sinai. Obama contacted Hollande to offer support and they plan to work together against terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, and Obama is heading there after reviewing the latest intelligence.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the main event: the attacks after Obama's containment claim. Mention the casualties, Hollande's statement, Obama's dismissal of ISIS gaining strength, the concerns about returning fighters, the previous criticism, the other attack, Obama's support, and the G-20 developments.

I should make sure to include all these points concisely. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without exceeding the word limit. I'll also use the required tokens at the start and end.
