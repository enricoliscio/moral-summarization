Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about the Paris terrorist attacks. They provided the article, and I need to create a concise summary under 200 words. The summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are:

1. The attacks happened 12 hours after Obama declared ISIS contained.
2. ISIS claimed responsibility, resulting in 127 deaths and many injuries.
3. Hollande called it an act of war.
4. Obama's statements about ISIS not gaining strength and being contained.
5. Concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks.
6. The Paris attacks are the second major one by ISIS in two weeks, including the Russian plane downing.
7. Obama offered condolences and support to France.
8. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, while Obama is still attending.
9. Obama will review intelligence before the summit.

Now, I need to condense this into a coherent summary. I'll start by mentioning the attacks and their timing relative to Obama's statement. Then, highlight the casualties and Hollande's response. Next, include Obama's reassurance about ISIS being contained. Mention the concern about French citizens returning. Note the recent attacks, including the Russian plane. Then, the support from Obama and the cancellation of Hollande's trip. Finally, Obama's plan to review intelligence before the summit.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is included without unnecessary details.

I'll start with the attacks and their context, then move to the casualties and responses from Hollande and Obama. Then, address the concerns about returning fighters. Mention the other attack on the Russian plane. Then, the support offered and the cancellations. Finally, Obama's next steps.

I should check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words. Let me draft it:

SUMMARY: The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, resulting in 127 deaths and many injuries, just 12 hours after President Obama declared ISIS "contained." Hollande called it an act of war, while Obama reassured that ISIS was not gaining strength. Concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to attack France were noted. The attacks follow the downing of a Russian plane by ISIS. Obama offered support to France and will review intelligence before the G-20 summit. Hollande canceled his trip. END OF SUMMARY.

Wait, that's too short. Let me add more details to reach around 200 words without being too verbose.

I'll include that the U.S. and allies are making progress in reducing foreign fighters. Also, mention the criticism Obama faced in 2014. And the fact that the attacks are potentially the second major one in two weeks.

Revised summary:

SUMMARY: The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, resulting in 127 deaths and many injuries, just 12 hours after President Obama declared ISIS "contained." Hollande called it an act of war, while Obama reassured that ISIS was not gaining strength and that the U.S.-led coalition had contained them. Concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks were noted. The Paris attacks are potentially the second major one by ISIS in two weeks, following the downing of a Russian passenger plane in Sinai. Obama offered condolences and support to France, while Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit. Obama will review intelligence before attending the summit. END OF SUMMARY.

That should be concise and cover all main points within the word limit.
