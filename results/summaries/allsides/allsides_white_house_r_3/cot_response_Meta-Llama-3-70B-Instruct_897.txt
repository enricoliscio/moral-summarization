SUMMARY:
President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained" just 12 hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the "horrific" shootings and bombings, which French President Francois Hollande blamed as "an act of war." Despite Obama's claims, the attacks suggest that the extremist group is still a major threat. The president's statement was met with criticism, and his previous comments about the Islamic State being a "jayvee team" were recalled. Obama offered "steadfast, unwavering support" to France and pledged to work together to "defeat the scourge of terrorism." The attacks have raised concerns about the flow of foreign fighters and the group's ability to carry out attacks in Europe. END OF SUMMARY.
