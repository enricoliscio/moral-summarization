SUMMARY: Terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by the Islamic State just 12 hours after President Obama declared the group "contained," have left the world reeling. With at least 127 people dead and many more wounded, the French President, Francois Hollande, has blamed the Islamic State for "an act of war." Despite the President's assurances that the group was not gaining strength, the Paris killings and the recent downing of a Russian plane in the Sinai peninsula show a different, more alarming trend. Mr. Obama has offered his condolences to France and reaffirmed the United States' support in the fight against terrorism. The attacks have also prompted Mr. Hollande to cancel his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders, including Mr. Obama, were set to discuss the Islamic State, the Syrian civil war, and the refugee crisis. The President will convene his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence on the Paris attacks before departing for the G-20 Summit. These tragic events highlight the ongoing challenge of containing and defeating extremist groups like the Islamic State, underscoring the need for global cooperation and unwavering commitment to fight terrorism.
END OF SUMMARY.
