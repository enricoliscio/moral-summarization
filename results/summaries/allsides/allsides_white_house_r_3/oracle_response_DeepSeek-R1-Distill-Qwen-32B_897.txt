Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key events are the terrorist attacks in Paris by ISIS, occurring just after Obama declared ISIS contained. There are shootings, bombings, deaths, and injuries. Hollande called it an act of war. Obama's statements about containment and the coalition's efforts are important. Also, the mention of foreign fighters and the downing of the Russian plane adds context. The summary should include morally charged words like attacks, shootings, bombings, dead, wounded, war, contained, fighting, defeat, terrorism. I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects without losing the essence. I'll structure it to highlight the attacks, the political implications, and the international response.

SUMMARY: The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, including shootings and bombings, resulting in 127 deaths and numerous injuries, just hours after President Obama declared the group "contained." French President Hollande labeled the attacks "an act of war," while Obama maintained that ISIS was not gaining strength and had been "contained" by the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria. The attacks raised concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out further violence. ISIS also claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger plane in Sinai, killing all 224 aboard. Obama expressed condolences to France and pledged support in fighting terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit to focus on the attacks, while Obama convened his National Security Council to review intelligence. The attacks underscored the ongoing threat of terrorism and the need for international cooperation to combat it. END OF SUMMARY.
