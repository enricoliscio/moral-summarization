Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Paris terrorist attacks and the context around it. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the Paris attacks happened just 12 hours after Obama declared ISIS was contained. That's a big point because it shows a contradiction between the claims and the reality. Then, it talks about the casualties and Hollande blaming ISIS for an act of war. Obama's statements about ISIS not gaining strength and being contained are important, as well as his dismissal of the idea that ISIS is getting stronger.

I should note that the US-led coalition, including French forces, is fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. There's also concern about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks. The article mentions the criticism Obama faced earlier for downplaying ISIS, calling them a JV team. Then, it adds that this might be the second major attack in two weeks, including the Russian plane downing.

Obama reached out to Hollande to offer support and condolences, and both leaders pledged to work together against terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, and Obama is still going, planning to review intelligence before the summit.

Now, I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing. The author seems critical of Obama's claim that ISIS was contained, especially since the attack happened shortly after. There's a sense of failure or underestimation of ISIS's capabilities. Also, the concern about returning fighters and the potential for more attacks adds to the moral weight of the situation.

I should structure the summary to highlight the timing of the attack relative to Obama's statement, the casualties, Hollande's response, Obama's dismissal of ISIS's strength, the coalition efforts, the criticism of Obama's past remarks, the recent attacks, and the leaders' pledges to fight terrorism together.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all these elements. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is included without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Paris terrorist attacks, claimed by ISIS, occurred just 12 hours after President Obama stated that the group had been "contained." The attacks left at least 127 dead and many injured, prompting French President Hollande to label it an "act of war." Obama dismissed claims that ISIS was growing stronger, asserting that the group had not gained ground in Iraq or Syria. However, the timing of the attacks raised questions about the effectiveness of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS. Security concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks were also highlighted. The Paris attacks followed another ISIS claim of responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger plane, killing 224. Obama offered condolences to France and reaffirmed U.S. support, while Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit to focus on the crisis. Obama planned to review intelligence before attending the summit. END OF SUMMARY.
