Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure for the response, so I should follow that.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "terrorist attacks," "extremist," "contained," "horrific," "scourge," "friend," "pledged," "cancel," "deepest," "condemn," and "oppose" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, I have to write a concise summary. I need to include these moral words to maintain the original framing. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the attacks happening after Obama's statement, Hollande's response, the criticism of Obama's earlier comment, the Paris attacks and the Russian plane, the support from Obama, and the cancellation of the G-20 trip.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes all the important details without being too lengthy. I'll structure it to highlight the moral implications, such as the failure to contain the group and the international response against terrorism.

Let me put it all together, ensuring that the morally framed words are included and the summary is clear and within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, resulting in 127 deaths and many injuries, just hours after President Obama claimed the group had been "contained." French President Hollande labeled the attacks as "an act of war," while Obama maintained that the Islamic State was not gaining strength and that the U.S.-led coalition had "contained" them. Critics pointed to Obama's earlier dismissal of the group as a "jayvee team." The Paris attacks followed the Islamic State's claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger plane. Obama offered condolences to France and pledged international cooperation to combat terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit to focus on the crisis, while Obama convened his National Security Council to review intelligence on the attacks. The attacks highlighted the ongoing threat of terrorism and the need for global unity in opposing it.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
