SUMMARY:

President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained" just 12 hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, which French President Francois Hollande described as "an act of war." In an interview, Obama rejected the notion that the Islamic State was getting stronger, saying "we have contained them" and that they had not gained ground in Iraq and Syria. However, the Paris attacks and the downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula on October 31, which the Islamic State also claimed responsibility for, have raised concerns about the group's strength. Obama spoke with Hollande to offer condolences and pledged to work together to defeat terrorism. The two leaders were scheduled to meet at the G-20 summit in Turkey, but Hollande canceled his trip in the wake of the attacks.
