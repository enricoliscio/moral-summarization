SUMMARY: The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the devastating shootings and bombings in Paris that left at least 127 people dead and many more wounded. This tragic attack occurred just hours after President Obama stated that the extremist group had been "contained," sparking criticism and concern about the growing strength of the Islamic State. French President Hollande strongly condemned the act, calling it "an act of war." The G-20 summit in Turkey, intended to discuss the fight against the Islamic State and the Syrian civil war, was overshadowed by the horrific attack, with President Hollande canceling his trip. Mr. Obama, who offered condolences and support to France, also faced criticism for previously downplaying the threat posed by the Islamic State. The Paris killings, along with the recent downing of a Russian plane, highlight the urgent need to address the threat posed by the Islamic State and the global scourge of terrorism.

END OF SUMMARY.
