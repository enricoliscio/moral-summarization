SUMMARY:

Just 12 hours after President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained", the extremist group claimed responsibility for the devastating terrorist attacks in Paris, leaving at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. French President Francois Hollande condemned the attacks as "an act of war". In a recent interview, President Obama rejected the notion that the Islamic State was gaining strength, stating that "we have contained them" and that they had not gained ground in Iraq and Syria. However, the Paris killings and the downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula on October 31, killing all 224 aboard, suggest otherwise. President Obama spoke with President Hollande to offer condolences and reiterated the US's steadfast support for France in the fight against terrorism. The two leaders pledged to work together to defeat the scourge of terrorism. The attacks have sparked widespread concern and criticism, with many questioning President Obama's earlier assessment of the Islamic State's strength.
