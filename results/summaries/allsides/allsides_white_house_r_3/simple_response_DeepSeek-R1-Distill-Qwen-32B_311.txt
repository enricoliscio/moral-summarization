Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the terrorist attacks in Paris by ISIS, which happened just after President Obama declared that ISIS had been contained. The attacks resulted in many casualties, and both Hollande and Obama commented on the situation. Obama was criticized for downplaying ISIS earlier and now stands by his containment claims. The article also mentions the downing of a Russian plane by ISIS and the upcoming G-20 summit where Hollande was supposed to meet Obama but canceled due to the attacks. The summary needs to capture these elements concisely, highlighting the moral implications of Obama's statements and the criticism surrounding them.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the main events and the moral framing, such as the criticism of Obama's containment claim and the implications of the attacks. I'll structure it by mentioning the attacks, Obama's comments, the criticism, the impact on Hollande's plans, and the ongoing efforts to combat terrorism. Keeping it clear and concise while maintaining the moral perspective is key.

SUMMARY:  
The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, resulting in 127 deaths and numerous injuries, just hours after President Obama declared the group "contained." Obama dismissed claims that ISIS was gaining strength, stating they had been contained and were not advancing in Iraq or Syria. However, the attacks, which French President Hollande called "an act of war," have drawn criticism of Obama's earlier downplay of ISIS, including his 2014 reference to the group as a "jayvee team." The attacks also follow the claimed downing of a Russian plane by ISIS in Sinai. Obama offered condolences to France and reaffirmed U.S. support in combating terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey to focus on the attacks, while Obama planned to review intelligence before attending the summit. The attacks highlight the ongoing threat of ISIS and the challenges in countering terrorism.  
END OF SUMMARY.
