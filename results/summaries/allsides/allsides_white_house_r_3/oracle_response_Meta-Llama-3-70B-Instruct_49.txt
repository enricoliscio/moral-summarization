SUMMARY:

President Obama's declaration that the Islamic State had been "contained" was swiftly followed by the terrorist group's brutal attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The French President, Francois Hollande, condemned the attacks as "an act of war" and blamed the Islamic State for the carnage. Despite the devastating attacks, President Obama maintained that the extremist group was not gaining strength, and that "we have contained them." However, the Paris killings, which came just two weeks after the downing of a Russian passenger plane, suggest that the Islamic State remains a potent force. The attacks have sparked widespread outrage, and both leaders have pledged to work together to "defeat the scourge of terrorism." President Obama is set to convene his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence surrounding the attacks before departing for the G-20 Summit in Turkey.
