SUMMARY: Terrorist attacks in Paris carried out by the Islamic State left at least 127 people dead and many more wounded, just hours after President Obama declared that the group had been "contained." The attacks in Paris are the second major incident linked to the Islamic State in two weeks, following the downing of a Russian plane in Egypt. In an interview, Obama stated that the Islamic State was not gaining strength and that the U.S.-led coalition had successfully contained them in Iraq and Syria. He also noted progress in reducing the flow of foreign fighters. However, the Paris attacks highlight the continued threat posed by the group, and Obama has offered France support in the investigation. French President Francois Hollande has declared the attacks "an act of war" and canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders, including Obama, will discuss the fight against the Islamic State and other global issues. Obama will convene his National Security Council before attending the summit to review the latest intelligence on the Paris attacks.
END OF SUMMARY.
