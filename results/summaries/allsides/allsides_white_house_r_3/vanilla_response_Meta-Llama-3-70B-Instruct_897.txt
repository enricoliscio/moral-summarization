SUMMARY:

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and many wounded. The attacks occurred just 12 hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained." French President Francois Hollande blamed the Islamic State for "an act of war." In an interview with ABC News, President Obama said the group was not gaining strength and that "we have contained them." However, the Paris attacks and the downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula on October 31, killing all 224 aboard, suggest otherwise. President Obama spoke with President Hollande to offer condolences and reiterated the US's support for France. The two leaders pledged to work together to defeat terrorism. President Obama is set to attend the G-20 summit in Turkey, where he will meet with world leaders to discuss the fight against the Islamic State and other global issues.
