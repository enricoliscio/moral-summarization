SUMMARY:

President Obama's declaration that the Islamic State had been "contained" was met with devastating consequences, as the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the brutal attacks in Paris that left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. French President Francois Hollande condemned the attacks as "an act of war." The president's statement was widely criticized, as the Islamic State has shown no signs of weakening, instead perpetrating horrific killings, including the downing of a Russian passenger plane that killed all 224 aboard. The Paris attacks are a stark reminder of the ongoing war against terrorism, and the need for international cooperation to defeat this scourge. President Obama has offered condolences to the French people and pledged to work with nations around the world to combat terrorism. The attacks have also led to the cancellation of Hollande's trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders were set to discuss the fight against the Islamic State and the refugee crisis in Europe.
