SUMMARY: In a tragic turn of events, the Islamic State carried out devastating terrorist attacks in Paris just hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained." The attacks left at least 127 people dead and many others wounded, with French President Francois Hollande calling it "an act of war." Despite Mr. Obama's assurances, the Islamic State has proven its deadly capabilities once again, highlighting the urgent need for a unified global response. Security concerns about French citizens joining the extremist group and returning to carry out attacks have been realized, underscoring the complexity and gravity of the threat. With the Paris killings and the previous downing of a Russian plane, the Islamic State has demonstrated its expanding reach and growing boldness. As world leaders gather at the G-20 summit in Turkey, the fight against the Islamic State, the Syrian civil war, and the refugee crisis will undoubtedly take center stage. Mr. Obama and Mr. Hollande have pledged to work together to tackle the scourge of terrorism, sending a strong message of solidarity and determination. The challenge now lies in translating words into effective action to prevent future atrocities and bring peace and security to a troubled world. END OF SUMMARY.
