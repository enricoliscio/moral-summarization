SUMMARY: Islamic State terrorists attacked Paris, France, killing at least 127 people just hours after President Obama declared the group "contained." French President Francois Hollande blamed the Islamic State for "an act of war." Obama had stated in an interview that the group was not gaining strength and that the U.S.-led coalition had made progress in containing them in Iraq and Syria. Security officials, however, have expressed concern about the threat posed by French citizens who join the extremist group. This attack follows another claimed by the Islamic State, the downing of a Russian plane in Egypt. Obama offered condolences to Hollande and reaffirmed support for France. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, where world leaders, including Obama, plan to discuss the fight against the Islamic State and other issues. Obama will convene his National Security Council before attending the summit.
