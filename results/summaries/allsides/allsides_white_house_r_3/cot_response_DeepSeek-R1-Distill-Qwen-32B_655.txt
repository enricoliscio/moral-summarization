Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should go through the article and identify the morally charged words. Let me read through it again.

The article talks about terrorist attacks in Paris by the Islamic State, which happened shortly after Obama declared they were "contained." The Islamic State claimed responsibility, leaving many dead and wounded. Hollande called it an "act of war." Obama said they weren't gaining strength, and the U.S. was working to contain them. He also mentioned reducing foreign fighters. There's criticism of Obama's past comments about the group being a "jayvee team." The Islamic State is linked to another attack, the downing of a Russian plane. Obama offered condolences and support, and both leaders pledged to defeat terrorism. Hollande canceled a trip to the G-20 summit, and Obama was reviewing intelligence before the summit.

Now, the morally framed words. Let me list them:

- Terrorist attacks
- Islamic State (ISIL/ISIS)
- Blamed
- Act of war
- Contained
- Gaining strength
- Jayvee team
- Reduce the flow of foreign fighters
- Horrific
- Scourge of terrorism
- Steadfast, unwavering support
- Pledged to work together
- Defeat
- Cancel
- Review the latest intelligence

Wait, some of these might not be moral, but more descriptive. Let me check each word:

- Terrorist attacks: moral because it's a negative action.
- Islamic State: neutral, but in context, it's framed negatively.
- Blamed: moral because it's assigning responsibility for a bad action.
- Act of war: moral framing as a serious violation.
- Contained: positive action by the U.S., so moral.
- Gaining strength: negative implication.
- Jayvee team: criticized as downplaying the threat.
- Reduce flow: positive action.
- Horrific: negative moral judgment.
- Scourge: negative.
- Steadfast support: positive.
- Pledged: positive commitment.
- Defeat: positive action.
- Cancel: neutral, but in context, it's a consequence.
- Review: neutral, but part of the response.

Okay, so I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

Now, the summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the attacks and their timing after Obama's statement. Then, the responsibility claimed by ISIS. Hollande's response as an act of war. Obama's comments on containment and the flow of fighters. Criticism of his past remarks. The other attack on the Russian plane. Obama's condolences and support. The leaders' pledge to fight terrorism. Hollande canceling his trip. Obama reviewing intelligence.

I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, so I'll use words like "terrorist attacks," "act of war," "contained," "scourge," "pledged," etc.

Let me put it all together in a coherent summary.
