SUMMARY:

President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained" just 12 hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, which French President Francois Hollande called "an act of war." In an interview with ABC News, Obama rejected the notion that the Islamic State was gaining strength, saying "we have contained them." However, the Paris attacks and the downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula on October 31, which the Islamic State also claimed responsibility for, suggest otherwise. Obama spoke with Hollande to offer condolences and reiterated the US's support for France, pledging to work together to defeat terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where he was to meet with Obama and other world leaders to discuss the fight against the Islamic State.
