SUMMARY: The terrorist attacks in Paris, perpetrated by the Islamic State just hours after President Obama declared the extremist group "contained," highlight the moral imperative of addressing global terrorism with unwavering resolve. Despite Mr. Obama's assertions, the Islamic State has demonstrated its growing strength and reach, claiming responsibility for the heinous attacks in Paris that left countless innocent lives lost and many more injured. This act of war, as rightly stated by French President Francois Hollande, underscores the urgent need for a unified global response. The Paris killings, along with the previous downing of a Russian passenger plane, serve as tragic reminders of the Islamic State's expanding threat. Mr. Obama has offered condolences and pledged support to France, our oldest ally, in the fight against terrorism. The moral duty to protect innocent lives and uphold the values of freedom and security demands a coordinated and robust response from the international community. It is imperative that world leaders, including Mr. Obama and Mr. Hollande, who canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, come together to address this scourge. The containment of the Islamic State and the protection of vulnerable citizens from such atrocious acts must be a shared moral responsibility. END OF SUMMARY.
