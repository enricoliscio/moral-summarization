Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about the Paris attacks. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

The article talks about how the Islamic State carried out attacks in Paris just 12 hours after President Obama said they were contained. That's a key point. The attacks resulted in 127 deaths and many injuries. Hollande called it an act of war. Obama's comments were that ISIS wasn't gaining strength, but the attacks happened right after his statement. There's also mention of concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to attack in France. The Paris attacks are the second major one by ISIS in two weeks, the other being the downing of a Russian plane. Obama reached out to Hollande to offer support, and both leaders plan to work together against terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, while Obama is still going, and he'll review the latest intelligence before leaving.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to include the main events: the timing of the attacks, Obama's statement, Hollande's response, the casualties, the prior criticism of Obama's comments, the other attack on the Russian plane, the support offered, and the leaders' actions post-attack.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the attacks, then the political implications, and the aftermath. I need to keep it concise, avoiding too much detail but covering all key points. Also, make sure to use the correct acronyms for Islamic State (ISIS, ISIL, etc.) and the leaders' names correctly.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too wordy. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, which occurred just 12 hours after President Obama stated that the group had been "contained." The attacks, involving shootings and bombings, killed at least 127 people and injured many others. French President Fran√ßois Hollande labeled the attacks "an act of war," while Obama maintained that ISIS was not gaining strength and that efforts to contain them were successful. Security concerns persist over French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks. The Paris attacks follow the ISIS-linked downing of a Russian passenger plane in Sinai, killing 224. Obama expressed condolences to Hollande and reaffirmed U.S. support for France's fight against terrorism. Hollande canceled his G-20 summit trip, while Obama will attend and review intelligence on the attacks before leaving.  
END OF SUMMARY.
