SUMMARY: Less than a day before the Paris terrorist attacks, President Obama stated in an interview that the Islamic State was "contained" and not gaining strength. However, the attacks, which left at least 127 people dead and many more wounded, proved otherwise. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the shootings and bombings, with French President Francois Hollande calling it "an act of war." Obama faced criticism for his previous comments and his early 2014 reference to the Islamic State as a "jayvee team." The Paris attacks are the second major incident in two weeks, following the downing of a Russian plane in Sinai. Obama offered condolences to Hollande and pledged support in the fight against terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders were set to discuss the Islamic State, the Syrian civil war, and the refugee crisis. Obama will also attend the summit and convene his National Security Council to review intelligence on the Paris attacks.
END OF SUMMARY.
