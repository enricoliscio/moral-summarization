SUMMARY:

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The attacks occurred just 12 hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained." In an interview with ABC News, Obama said the Islamic State was not gaining strength and that "we have contained them." However, French President Francois Hollande blamed the Islamic State for "an act of war." The Paris killings are potentially the second major attack carried out by the Islamic State in two weeks, following the downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula. Obama spoke with Hollande to offer condolences and reiterated the US's support for France. The two leaders pledged to work together to defeat terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, while Obama will convene his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence surrounding the attacks.
