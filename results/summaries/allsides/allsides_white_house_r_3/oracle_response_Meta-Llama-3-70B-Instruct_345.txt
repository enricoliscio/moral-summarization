SUMMARY:

Just hours after President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained," the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the devastating attacks in Paris, leaving at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. French President Francois Hollande condemned the attacks as "an act of war." Despite the horrific killings, President Obama insisted that the Islamic State was not gaining strength, and that "we have contained them." However, the group's recent attacks, including the downing of a Russian passenger plane, suggest otherwise. The Paris attacks are a stark reminder of the ongoing war against terrorism, and the need for international cooperation to defeat the scourge of terrorism. President Obama and President Hollande have pledged to work together to reduce the flow of foreign fighters and bring those responsible to justice. The investigation into the attacks is ongoing, and the world remains on high alert against further terrorist attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
