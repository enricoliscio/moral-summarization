SUMMARY:

President Obama stated that the Islamic State (IS) had been "contained" just 12 hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The IS claimed responsibility for the attacks, which French President Francois Hollande described as "an act of war." In an interview, Obama rejected the notion that the IS was gaining strength, saying that "we have contained them" and that they had not gained ground in Iraq and Syria. However, security officials are concerned about the potential return of French citizens who joined the IS in Syria to carry out attacks in France. The Paris attacks come just two weeks after the IS claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger plane, killing all 224 aboard. Obama spoke with Hollande to offer condolences and reiterated the US's support for France, pledging to work together to defeat terrorism.
