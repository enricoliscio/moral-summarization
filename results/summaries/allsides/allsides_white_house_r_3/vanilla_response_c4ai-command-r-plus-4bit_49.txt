SUMMARY: The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the terrorist attacks in Paris that left at least 127 people dead, just hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained." In an interview, Obama rejected the notion that ISIS was gaining strength and asserted that the U.S.-led coalition had successfully contained their territorial expansion in Iraq and Syria. However, the Paris attacks and the recent downing of a Russian plane, both claimed by ISIS, suggest otherwise. Obama has offered condolences and support to French President Francois Hollande, who blamed ISIS for "an act of war." Hollande has canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders, including Obama, were set to discuss the fight against ISIS and the Syrian civil war. Obama will convene his National Security Council before attending the G-20 Summit to review the latest intelligence on the Paris attacks. This incident highlights the ongoing challenge of combating global terrorism and the evolving nature of extremist groups like ISIS. END OF SUMMARY.
