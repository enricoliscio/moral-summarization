Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Paris terrorist attacks and the context around President Obama's statements. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main events are the attacks in Paris by ISIS, the timing just after Obama declared ISIS contained, Hollande's response, and Obama's defense of the containment strategy. There's also mention of the Russian plane incident and the G-20 summit cancellation.

I should highlight the moral aspects, like the criticism of Obama's earlier dismissal of ISIS as a "jayvee team" and the criticism of his recent claim of containment. Also, the emotional impact on France and the international response.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the attacks and their timing. Then, include Obama's statements and the criticism. Next, Hollande's reaction and the broader context of the attacks. Finally, the impact on the G-20 plans.

I'll structure it to flow logically, ensuring each sentence adds value without unnecessary details. I'll make sure to include the moral implications, like the criticism of Obama's earlier remarks and the emotional toll on France.

Let me draft it, ensuring it's concise and captures all necessary points while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, which occurred just 12 hours after President Obama declared the group "contained." The attacks, which killed at least 127 people, were described by French President Francois Hollande as "an act of war." Obama reiterated that ISIS had not gained strength and that the U.S.-led coalition had successfully contained the group, rejecting claims that ISIS was growing stronger. Critics, however, pointed to the attacks as evidence of ISIS's resilience and the potential threat posed by French citizens returning from Syria. The Paris attacks follow the group's claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger plane earlier in October. Obama expressed condolences to France and pledged continued support in combating terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where the fight against ISIS was on the agenda, while Obama planned to review intelligence on the attacks before attending the summit. The attacks underscored the ongoing challenges in countering ISIS's global threat.  
END OF SUMMARY.
