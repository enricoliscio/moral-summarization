SUMMARY:

President Obama's declaration that the Islamic State had been "contained" was tragically contradicted by the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, which French President Francois Hollande called "an act of war." Despite Obama's assurances that the extremist group was not gaining strength, the attacks demonstrate the group's continued threat. The president's words were criticized as downplaying the danger of the Islamic State, echoing his earlier reference to the group as a "jayvee team." The attacks highlight the need for international cooperation to combat terrorism, as pledged by Obama and Hollande. The tragedy also underscores the importance of vigilance and effective action against the Islamic State, rather than complacent assurances of containment.

END OF SUMMARY.
