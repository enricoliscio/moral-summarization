SUMMARY: The Islamic State carried out horrific terrorist attacks in Paris, killing at least 127 people and wounding many others. This act of war came just hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been contained and was not gaining strength. The French President, Francois Hollande, blamed the Islamic State for the attack and vowed to defeat the scourge of terrorism. The U.S. President has offered condolences and support to France, reiterating the unwavering support of the American people for their oldest ally. Security concerns have been raised as hundreds of French citizens have joined the extremist group and could potentially carry out further attacks. The Paris killings are the second major attack by the Islamic State in recent weeks, with the group also claiming responsibility for the downing of a Russian plane in the Sinai peninsula. The fight against the Islamic State, the Syrian civil war, and the refugee crisis will be discussed at the G-20 summit in Turkey, which Mr. Hollande has canceled his attendance for.
