SUMMARY: The terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by the Islamic State just 12 hours after President Obama declared the group "contained," have brought to light the contrasting views on the threat of ISIS. Despite the group's growing boldness and reach, demonstrated by the Paris attacks and the downing of a Russian plane, Mr. Obama maintains that they are not gaining strength and have been controlled. This is not the first time the President has downplayed the threat of ISIS, having referred to them as a "jayvee team" in 2014. The Paris attacks, which left at least 127 dead, have shown the world that ISIS is far from contained and that the threat of terrorism is very real. Mr. Obama's words, therefore, appear dangerously misguided and highlight a disconnect between his administration and the reality of the situation. The attacks should serve as a stark reminder that the war against ISIS is far from over and that a unified global effort is needed to defeat this enemy. Mr. Hollande's strong response, calling the attacks "an act of war," underscores the severity of the threat and the need for urgent action. The world must stand united with France in the fight against ISIS and work together to prevent future atrocities. END OF SUMMARY.
