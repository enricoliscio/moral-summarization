SUMMARY:

The Islamic State carried out devastating attacks in Paris, claiming responsibility for the shootings and bombings that left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded, many seriously. French President Francois Hollande condemned the act as "an act of war." Just 12 hours prior, President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained," rejecting the notion that they were gaining strength. However, the Paris killings and the downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula on October 31, killing all 224 aboard, suggest otherwise. The attacks have sparked widespread concern, with security officials worried about the potential return of hundreds of French citizens who joined the extremist group in Syria to carry out attacks. President Obama has offered condolences to the people of France and reiterated the United States' steadfast support to defeat the "scourge of terrorism." The two leaders have pledged to work together to investigate and combat the terrorist group.
