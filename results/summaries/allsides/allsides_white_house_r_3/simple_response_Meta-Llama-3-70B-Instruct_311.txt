SUMMARY:

President Obama's declaration that the Islamic State had been "contained" was met with devastating irony as the extremist group claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, killing at least 127 people and wounding many more. French President Francois Hollande condemned the attacks as "an act of war." Despite the president's assurance that the Islamic State was not gaining strength, the group's recent attacks, including the downing of a Russian passenger plane, suggest otherwise. The president's words have sparked criticism, reminiscent of his 2014 remark referring to the Islamic State as a "jayvee team." The attacks have led to a heightened sense of urgency, with President Hollande canceling his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey and President Obama convening his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence. The moral imperative is clear: the international community must come together to defeat the scourge of terrorism and protect innocent lives.
