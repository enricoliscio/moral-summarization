SUMMARY:
President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained" just 12 hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. French President Francois Hollande blamed the Islamic State for "an act of war." In an interview, Mr. Obama rejected the notion that the Islamic State was gaining strength, stating that "we have contained them." However, the Paris killings and the downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula on Oct. 31, killing all 224 aboard, suggest otherwise. Mr. Obama spoke with Mr. Hollande to offer the condolences of the American people for the "horrific" terrorist attacks and reiterated the United States' "steadfast, unwavering support" for France. The two leaders pledged to work together to "defeat the scourge of terrorism." END OF SUMMARY.
