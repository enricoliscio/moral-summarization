SUMMARY:
The terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by the Islamic State, resulted in at least 127 deaths and many wounded. This tragic event occurred only 12 hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained." The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the shootings and bombings, an act that French President Francois Hollande labeled as an "act of war." President Obama's statement was met with criticism and rejection, as he also faced backlash for previously referring to the Islamic State as a "jayvee team." The Paris killings and the downing of a Russian plane in the Sinai peninsula, both claimed by the Islamic State, highlight the group's growing threat. In the wake of the attacks, President Hollande canceled his scheduled trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders, including President Obama, will discuss strategies to defeat the scourge of terrorism. President Obama offered unwavering support and condolences to France, reaffirming the strong bond between the two nations as our oldest ally. The fight against the Islamic State and the pursuit of justice for the victims of these horrific attacks remain a steadfast priority for the international community.
