SUMMARY:
The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, killing at least 127 people and wounding many others. This horrific act of terrorism came just hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained." In an interview, Mr. Obama rejected the notion that the Islamic State was gaining strength, referring to them as a "jayvee team." The group claimed responsibility for the attacks, which French President Francois Hollande called "an act of war." Mr. Obama offered condolences and unwavering support to France, our oldest ally and friend, and pledged to work together to defeat the scourge of terrorism. These attacks, along with the potential downing of a Russian plane by the Islamic State, highlight the continued threat posed by this extremist group. President Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 conference in Turkey, where world leaders, including Mr. Obama, were set to discuss the fight against the Islamic State and the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe.
