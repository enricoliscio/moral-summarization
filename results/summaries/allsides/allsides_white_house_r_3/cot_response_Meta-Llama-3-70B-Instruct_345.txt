SUMMARY:
President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained" just 12 hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the "horrific" shootings and bombings, which French President Francois Hollande called "an act of war." Despite Obama's claims, the attacks suggest that the extremist group is still gaining "strength." The president was criticized for downplaying the threat of the Islamic State, which has also claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger plane. Obama and Hollande pledged to work together to "defeat the scourge of terrorism" and offer "steadfast, unwavering support" to each other. The attacks have led to a heightened sense of urgency, with Obama convening his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence before departing for the G-20 summit in Turkey.
