SUMMARY:

The devastating terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded, have exposed the flaws in President Obama's assessment of the Islamic State's strength. Just 12 hours before the attacks, Obama declared that the extremist group had been "contained." However, the attacks demonstrate that the group is still capable of carrying out brutal and deadly acts of terror. French President Francois Hollande has rightly blamed the Islamic State for "an act of war." The tragedy highlights the importance of recognizing the true nature of the threat posed by the Islamic State and taking decisive action to combat it. The fact that Obama's administration has been criticized for downplaying the threat of the Islamic State in the past adds to the gravity of the situation. The international community must come together to defeat the scourge of terrorism and protect innocent lives.
