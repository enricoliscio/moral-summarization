Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article talks about the terrorist attacks in Paris by ISIS, which happened just after President Obama declared ISIS contained. So, the timing is significant—attacks came 12 hours after Obama's statement. ISIS claimed responsibility, leading to 127 deaths and many injuries. French President Hollande called it an act of war.

Obama's comments are important. He stated that ISIS isn't gaining strength and has been contained. He dismissed the idea that ISIS is getting stronger, pointing out they haven't made gains in Iraq and Syria. He mentioned the US-led coalition, including France, is making progress in reducing foreign fighters. There's also concern about French citizens returning from Syria to attack France.

Additionally, the article mentions another attack by ISIS on a Russian plane, killing 224 people. Obama contacted Hollande to offer condolences and support, and both leaders pledged to fight terrorism together. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit due to the attacks, while Obama is still attending, with a National Security Council meeting before leaving.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and statements. I should include the attacks, Obama's containment claim, Hollande's response, the implications of the attacks, and the leaders' commitments. Also, note the G-20 developments.

Let me structure it: start with the attacks and their timing, mention ISIS's claim, casualties, Hollande's statement. Then, Obama's comments on containment, his dismissal of ISIS gaining strength, the coalition's progress. Concern about French citizens. Mention the Russian plane attack. Obama's condolences, their pledge, Hollande canceling G-20, Obama's plans, and the NSC meeting.

I need to ensure it's concise and flows well, hitting all key points without going over the word limit.
