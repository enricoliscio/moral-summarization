Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Paris terrorist attacks and the related events. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that the attacks happened 12 hours after President Obama declared that ISIS had been contained. That's a significant point because it shows a contradiction between the claims of containment and the actual occurrence of the attacks. I should include that in the summary.

Next, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, which resulted in 127 deaths and many injuries. French President Hollande called it an act of war. That's important to note as it highlights the severity and the official stance from France.

President Obama's statements are crucial here. He said ISIS wasn't gaining strength and that they were contained. He dismissed the idea that ISIS was getting stronger. This is a key point because it contrasts with the reality of the attacks, showing a possible underestimation of the threat.

Security concerns about French citizens returning from Syria to carry out attacks are mentioned. This context is important to show the ongoing threat and why the attacks were possible despite containment claims.

There's also the point about the Paris attacks being the second major one in two weeks, with the Russian plane downing. This shows the Islamic State's recent activity and their reach beyond France.

Obama reached out to Hollande to offer support and discussed working together against terrorism. This indicates international cooperation but also shows that despite efforts, the attacks happened.

Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, which was about fighting ISIS and the refugee crisis. This shows the impact of the attacks on international diplomacy and strategy.

Obama is convening his National Security Council before the summit to review intelligence. This shows the U.S. is taking the attacks seriously and is preparing a response.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these key points without going into too much detail. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the attacks, then the political context, the implications, and the international response.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and covers each main point without redundancy.
