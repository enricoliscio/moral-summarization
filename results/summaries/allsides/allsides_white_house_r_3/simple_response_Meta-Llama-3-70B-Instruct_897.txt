SUMMARY:

In a stark contrast to President Obama's declaration that the Islamic State had been "contained," the terrorist group claimed responsibility for the devastating attacks in Paris that left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. French President Francois Hollande rightly condemned the attacks as "an act of war." President Obama's remarks, made just 12 hours prior to the attacks, downplayed the group's strength, saying they were not gaining ground in Iraq and Syria. This assessment has been widely criticized, particularly in light of the recent downing of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai peninsula. The Paris attacks serve as a sobering reminder of the Islamic State's capabilities and the need for a unified international response to combat terrorism. The tragedy has prompted President Obama to convene an emergency National Security Council meeting to review the latest intelligence surrounding the attacks.
