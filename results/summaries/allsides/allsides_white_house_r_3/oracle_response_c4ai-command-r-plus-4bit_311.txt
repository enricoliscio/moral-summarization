SUMMARY: The terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by the Islamic State just 12 hours after President Obama declared the extremist group "contained," have left the world reeling. With at least 127 people dead and many more wounded, the French President Francois Hollande has called it "an act of war." Despite the President's assurances that the Islamic State was not gaining strength, the group has proven its ability to strike at the heart of a major European city. The Paris killings, along with the recent downing of a Russian plane, highlight the growing threat posed by the Islamic State. The attacks have prompted a unified response from world leaders, who have pledged to work together to defeat the scourge of terrorism. President Obama has offered his condolences and support to France, reiterating the unwavering support of the United States for its oldest ally. The French President has canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders, including President Obama, will discuss the fight against the Islamic State and the broader challenges of the Syrian civil war and the refugee crisis. The White House has stated that the President will convene his National Security Council before leaving for the summit to review the latest intelligence on the Paris attacks. These tragic attacks have underscored the urgent need for a coordinated global response to counter the threat of terrorism and ensure the safety of our citizens.
