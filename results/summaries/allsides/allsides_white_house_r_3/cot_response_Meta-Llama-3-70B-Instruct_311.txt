SUMMARY:
President Obama declared that the Islamic State had been "contained" just 12 hours before the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left at least 127 people dead and scores wounded. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the "act of war" and French President Francois Hollande blamed the group for the attacks. In an interview, Mr. Obama "rejected" the notion that the Islamic State was getting stronger, saying "we have contained them" and that they have not gained ground in Iraq and Syria. However, the Paris killings are potentially the second major attack carried out by the Islamic State in two weeks, raising concerns about the group's "strength". Mr. Obama offered "steadfast, unwavering support" to France and pledged to work together to "defeat the scourge of terrorism". END OF SUMMARY.
