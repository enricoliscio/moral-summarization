SUMMARY: The Islamic State carried out horrific terrorist attacks in Paris, killing at least 127 people and wounding many others. This act of war came just hours after President Obama declared that the extremist group had been contained and was not gaining strength. French President Hollande has blamed the Islamic State for the attack and has canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders, including Mr. Obama, were set to discuss the fight against the extremist group and the ongoing civil war and refugee crisis in Syria. Security officials have long been concerned about the threat posed by French citizens who join the Islamic State in Syria and then return to France. The Paris attacks are the second major attack by the Islamic State in recent weeks, following the downing of a Russian plane in the Sinai peninsula. Mr. Obama has offered condolences and support to France and pledged to work together to defeat the scourge of terrorism. The White House has stated that the president will review the latest intelligence on the Paris attacks with his National Security Council before departing for the G-20 summit.
END OF SUMMARY.
