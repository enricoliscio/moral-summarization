SUMMARY: The horrific terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by the Islamic State, left at least 127 people dead and many more wounded. This tragedy occurred just hours after President Obama stated that the extremist group had been "contained". The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the shootings and bombings, with French President Hollande denouncing their actions as "an act of war". Despite this, President Obama maintained that the Islamic State was not gaining strength and that their progress had been contained. He also offered condolences and support to France, reiterating the unwavering support of the United States for its oldest ally. Hollande has since canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey, where world leaders were set to discuss the fight against the Islamic State, the Syrian civil war, and the refugee crisis. President Obama, however, is still scheduled to attend and has pledged to work with nations around the world to defeat the scourge of terrorism. These attacks potentially mark the second major strike by the Islamic State in two weeks, following the downing of a Russian plane in the Sinai peninsula. END OF SUMMARY.
