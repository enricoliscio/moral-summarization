Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible, which are listed. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Paris attacks by ISIS, happening shortly after Obama declared ISIS contained. The attacks resulted in many casualties, Hollande called it an act of war, and Obama's statements are criticized. There's also mention of previous criticism of Obama's downplay of ISIS, and the upcoming G-20 summit that Hollande canceled.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words from the article: attacks, shootings, bombings, dead, wounded, war, contained, gained, march, fighting, reduce, referring, killings, attack, downing, killing, investigation, defeat, terrorism.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning the attacks and their timing, then the casualties, Hollande's response, Obama's statements, the criticism, the previous attack on the Russian plane, Obama's support, and the G-20 developments.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is maintained. I'll make sure to include words like "attacks," "shootings," "bombings," "dead," "wounded," "war," "contained," etc., as they highlight the severity and the moral implications.

I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and covers all key points while incorporating the specified terms. Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that all important moral elements are included.

SUMMARY:  
The Islamic State carried out terrorist attacks in Paris, including shootings and bombings, just hours after President Obama declared the group "contained." The attacks left at least 127 dead and many seriously wounded, prompting French President Fran√ßois Hollande to label it "an act of war." Obama maintained that ISIS had not gained strength or made significant gains in Iraq or Syria, emphasizing that the U.S.-led coalition had "contained" the group. However, the Paris killings, potentially the second major attack by ISIS in two weeks, raised questions about Obama's earlier characterization of the group as a "jayvee team." ISIS also claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian passenger plane, killing all 224 aboard. Obama offered condolences to France and reaffirmed support for the investigation and fight against terrorism. Hollande canceled his trip to the G-20 summit in Turkey to focus on the attacks, while Obama planned to review intelligence before attending the summit. The attacks underscored the ongoing threat of terrorism and the need for international cooperation to defeat it.  
END OF SUMMARY.
