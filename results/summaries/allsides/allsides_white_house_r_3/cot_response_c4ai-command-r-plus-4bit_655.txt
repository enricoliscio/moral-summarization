SUMMARY:
The horrific terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by the Islamic State extremist group, left at least 127 people dead and many more seriously wounded. This act of war came just hours after President Obama declared that the group had been "contained." In an interview, Obama rejected the notion that the Islamic State was gaining strength and insisted that the U.S.-led coalition had contained them. The French President, Hollande, blamed the Islamic State for the attack and canceled his trip to the G-20 summit, where he was to meet with world leaders, including Obama, to discuss the fight against the extremist group, the civil war in Syria, and the refugee crisis. Obama offered his unwavering support to France, our oldest ally, and pledged to work together to defeat the scourge of terrorism. In the wake of the horror in Paris, security officials are concerned about the threat posed by returning foreign fighters and the potential for more attacks. The President has convened his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence surrounding the attacks.
