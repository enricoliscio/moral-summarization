Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a specific structure to follow, which includes two steps: first, identifying all the morally framed single words, and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. The article talks about President Trump's comments on immigration, which have sparked a lot of criticism. Words like "vulgar," "derogatory," "shameful," "abhorrent," "unpresidential," "condemnation," "unkind," "divisive," "elitist," "ignorance," "prejudice," "racism," "shocking," "shameful," "racist," "shutdown," "troops," "fair," "sweetheart," "merit-based," "oppose," "grace," "peaceable," "considerate," "graciousness," and "abhorrent" come to mind. These words are used to describe Trump's actions, the reactions, and the broader implications of his statements.

Moving on to the summary, I need to condense the article into a concise version, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should reflect the moral framing by highlighting the criticism, the nature of Trump's comments, and the reactions from various groups. I should mention the specific countries affected, the DACA program, the proposed wall, and the political implications, including the threat of a government shutdown. Also, including the UN's and other officials' condemnations will add to the moral context.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, capturing all the key points without getting bogged down in details. I'll structure it to first mention Trump's comments and their reception, then the reactions from lawmakers, the UN, and other groups, followed by the political fallout and Trump's defense. Finally, I'll touch on the broader implications of his remarks regarding immigration policies.

I should also make sure that the summary accurately reflects the moral judgment embedded in the original article, using the identified words to convey the critical stance taken by many towards Trump's statements and actions. This way, the summary not only informs but also preserves the ethical and moral dimensions of the news.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump faced widespread criticism after reports emerged that he used a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied the allegations, calling the language "tough" but not derogatory, and redirected blame to Democrats for their "outlandish" immigration proposals. The controversy overshadowed his remarks at a White House event honoring Martin Luther King Jr., where he spoke about diversity and equality. Lawmakers, human rights officials, and foreign governments condemned his comments as shameful, abhorrent, and racist. Rep. Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, called his remarks unkind, divisive, and elitist. The UN also condemned the comments as shocking and racist. Trump rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal, blaming Democrats for opposing a merit-based immigration system. Some Democrats accused him of favoring immigration from predominantly white countries over black and brown ones. The controversy threatens to disrupt negotiations over a government spending plan, risking a shutdown. Republicans like Sen. Rubio criticized Trump's language, while others remained silent. END OF SUMMARY.
