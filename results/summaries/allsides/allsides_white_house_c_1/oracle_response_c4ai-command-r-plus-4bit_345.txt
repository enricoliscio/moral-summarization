SUMMARY: President Trump caused a global outrage after allegedly using vulgar and racist language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries in a meeting with lawmakers. While Trump denied using such language, his reported comments were met with widespread condemnation, including from human rights officials and lawmakers from both parties. The incident has also sparked protests from the governments of Haiti and El Salvador, who demanded an explanation and lodged a protest, respectively. Trump's attempt to redirect the focus onto Democratic proposals on immigration was rejected by Democrats, who claimed that his goal is to block immigration from predominantly black and brown countries. Some Republicans implicitly rebuked Trump's comments, while others remained silent. The incident has also raised concerns about a potential government shutdown over the DACA program, with Democrats threatening to block a new spending plan if the issue is not addressed. Trump's reported comments and the subsequent reaction highlight the ongoing debate over immigration policy and the moral implications of his proposed changes. END OF SUMMARY.
