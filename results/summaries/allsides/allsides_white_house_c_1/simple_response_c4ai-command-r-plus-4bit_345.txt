SUMMARY: President Trump denied using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries in a tweet, blaming the media for misrepresenting his statements. He claimed that his remarks were "tough" but not vulgar and shifted the focus to Democratic proposals on immigration, which he deemed unacceptable. Trump's denial came after The Washington Post reported his derogatory remarks about these countries during a DACA meeting, sparking widespread criticism and accusations of racism. The incident has caused outrage among lawmakers, human rights officials, and foreign governments, with some demanding an apology and an explanation from the President. Trump's attempt at clarification was overshadowed by his rejection of a bipartisan proposal on DACA, which he claimed lacked funding for the U.S.-Mexico wall and failed to address "chain migration." Democrats attributed Trump's alleged comments to his preference for immigration from predominantly white countries over those that are predominantly black or brown. Some congressional Democrats have even threatened a government shutdown if the DACA program is not addressed. Despite the backlash, Trump stood firm on his immigration demands, seeking to block immigration from countries he perceives as "high crime." Some Republicans rebuked Trump's remarks, while others remained silent.
END OF SUMMARY.
