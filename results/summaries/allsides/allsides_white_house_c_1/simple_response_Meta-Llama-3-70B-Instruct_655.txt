SUMMARY:

President Trump is facing backlash from Congress and the global community after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead redirecting focus to what he called "unacceptable Democratic proposals on immigration." However, his comments have been widely condemned as racist and shameful by lawmakers, human rights officials, and governments of Haiti and El Salvador. Trump's alleged comments have sparked outrage, with many arguing that his goal is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The incident has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration, with some Democrats threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed. Trump's comments have been denounced as "unkind, divisive, and elitist" and "shocking and shameful" by lawmakers and human rights officials.
