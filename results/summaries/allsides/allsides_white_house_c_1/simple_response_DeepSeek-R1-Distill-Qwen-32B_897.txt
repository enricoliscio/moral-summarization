Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump facing criticism for using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. He denied using such language and instead criticized Democratic immigration proposals. The Washington Post reported that Trump referred to "shithole countries" during a meeting about DACA. Trump later denied this, saying he didn't use derogatory terms and even suggested recording future meetings.

The moral framing here is about racism and prejudice. Many lawmakers, like Michelle Lujan Grisham and Mia Love, condemned his comments as racist and shameful. The UN also called the remarks shocking and racist. Trump, however, shifted the blame to Democrats, accusing them of wanting to allow immigration from countries with high crime rates, which some see as targeting black and brown countries.

The summary needs to capture Trump's denial, the accusations of racism, the reactions from various groups, and the political implications for DACA and immigration negotiations. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral aspects are clear.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's denial, mention the reported comments, the reactions from lawmakers and international bodies, Trump's criticism of Democrats, and the ongoing political conflict over DACA. Make sure to highlight the moral issues like racism and divisiveness.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise. Also, end with the specified tokens. Let me draft that.
