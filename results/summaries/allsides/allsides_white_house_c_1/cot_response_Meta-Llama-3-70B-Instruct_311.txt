SUMMARY:
President Trump is facing backlash for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead blaming Democrats for proposing "unacceptable" immigration policies. However, lawmakers and human rights officials have condemned Trump's comments as "shameful," "abhorrent," "racist," and "unkind." The President's remarks have sparked outrage, with many calling for an apology. The government of Haiti and El Salvador have demanded explanations, and the UN has labeled the comments as "shocking" and "racist." Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The controversy has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration, with some lawmakers threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed.
