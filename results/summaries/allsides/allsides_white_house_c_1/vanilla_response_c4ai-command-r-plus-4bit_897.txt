SUMMARY: President Trump denied using vulgar language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, amid widespread criticism. He redirected the focus to Democratic proposals on immigration, calling them unacceptable. The Washington Post reported that Trump questioned why the U.S. would accept immigrants from these "shithole countries" instead of places like Norway. Trump's comments were denounced as racist by lawmakers and human rights officials, including the UN. Trump rejected a bipartisan proposal on DACA, saying it lacked funding for the border wall and did not end "chain migration." Democrats accused Trump of wanting to block immigration from predominantly black and brown countries. Some Republicans implicitly rebuked Trump, while others remained silent. The government of Haiti demanded an explanation, and El Salvador lodged a protest. Trump's comments overshadowed upcoming negotiations between the White House and Congress on immigration.
END OF SUMMARY.
