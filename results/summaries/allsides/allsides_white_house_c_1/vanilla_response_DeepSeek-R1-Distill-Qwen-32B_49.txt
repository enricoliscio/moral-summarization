Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand what's happening. The article is about President Trump facing criticism after using a vulgar term to describe certain countries, specifically Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations. He denied using such language and instead criticized Democratic immigration proposals. The Washington Post reported that Trump used the term "shithole countries" during a meeting with lawmakers, which sparked a lot of backlash. 

He appeared at a White House event to honor Martin Luther King Jr., talking about diversity and equality, but avoided questions about the incident. Trump denied making derogatory comments about Haitians, saying he only mentioned their poverty. He also suggested recording future meetings. The article mentions that Trump wants to end the DACA program unless Democrats agree to new security measures, including a border wall. 

Some lawmakers and human rights officials called his comments racist. Representatives from both parties criticized him, with some demanding an apology. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador protested, and the UN also condemned the remarks. Trump rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal, blaming Democrats and wanting a merit-based system. Democrats accused him of favoring white countries and opposing others. There's a threat of a government shutdown if DACA isn't addressed, which Trump criticized. Some Republicans criticized him as well, with Sen. Rubio highlighting contributions from Haitian-Americans and Flake calling the remarks abhorrent.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Trump's denial, the reported use of offensive terms, the backlash, his redirection to immigration policies, the reactions from Democrats and Republicans, and the potential government shutdown. I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key aspects without getting too detailed.
