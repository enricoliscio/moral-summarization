SUMMARY:

President Trump is facing backlash for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead redirecting focus to Democratic proposals on immigration. However, lawmakers and human rights officials have denounced his comments as racist and shameful. The government of Haiti and El Salvador have demanded explanations, and a UN human rights spokesman called the comments "shocking and shameful." Trump's goal is seen as allowing immigration from predominantly white countries and blocking it from predominantly black and brown countries. The incident has sparked outrage, with many calling for Trump to apologize. The controversy has overshadowed upcoming negotiations on immigration and DACA, with some Democrats threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed.
