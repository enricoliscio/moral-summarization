Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump facing criticism for using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. He denied using the term and instead criticized Democratic immigration proposals. There's a mention of the Washington Post reporting his comments during a DACA meeting. Trump later tweeted denying the derogatory remarks and suggested he'd record future meetings. He's threatening to end DACA unless certain security measures are met, which some see as racist. Lawmakers and UN officials condemned his comments. Some Republicans defended him, while others criticized him. Democrats accused him of wanting immigration from white countries and blocking others. There's a risk of a government shutdown if DACA isn't addressed.

Now, I need to summarize this in under 200 words, focusing on the moral aspects. I should highlight Trump's denial, the accusations of racism, the reactions from lawmakers, and the potential shutdown. I need to keep the moral framing, so I'll mention the criticism of his comments as racist and the reactions against that.

Let me structure this: Start with Trump denying the comments, mention the Washington Post report, his denial, and the context of DACA. Then, discuss the accusations of racism, reactions from lawmakers, UN, and other countries. Include the Republican responses and the threat of government shutdown. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I should avoid any markdown and just write the summary. Make sure it's clear and captures the moral issues involved.
