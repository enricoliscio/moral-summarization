SUMMARY: President Trump has come under fire for reportedly using vulgar and racist language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers on immigration. While Trump denied using such language, his comments have been widely condemned as unacceptable, divisive, and elitist, with some lawmakers demanding an apology. The incident has also sparked outrage from human rights officials and foreign governments, who have called the comments shocking, shameful, and racist. The reported comments have also sparked discussions about Trump's stance on immigration, with Democrats accusing him of favoring immigration from predominantly white countries while trying to block it from predominately black and brown countries. Some Republicans have implicitly rebuked Trump's comments, while others have stayed silent. The incident comes as Congress and the White House are negotiating a deal on the DACA program, with Trump threatening to kill it unless his demands for new security measures are met. The negotiations are likely to be overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Trump's comments.
END OF SUMMARY.
