SUMMARY: President Trump caused a global outrage after he reportedly used a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers on immigration. While Trump denied using the specific language, he acknowledged that his comments were "tough". The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with lawmakers and human rights officials denouncing the comments as racist and unpresidential. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and apologies, and the United Nations also criticized Trump's remarks. Some Republicans implicitly rebuked Trump, while others remained silent. Trump's comments come as he seeks to end the DACA program and implement new security measures to block illegal immigration. Democrats have accused Trump of favoring immigration from predominantly white countries while blocking it from predominately black and brown countries. The incident has also caused a rift between Trump and some lawmakers, with a potential government shutdown looming as Democrats threaten to block a new spending plan unless DACA is addressed.
END OF SUMMARY.
