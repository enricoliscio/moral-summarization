SUMMARY:
President Trump faced backlash from lawmakers and human rights officials after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. Trump denied using the term, instead blaming Democrats for proposing "unacceptable" immigration policies. However, his comments were widely condemned as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist." Lawmakers and officials from Haiti, El Salvador, and the UN denounced Trump's remarks, with some calling for an apology. Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The controversy has cast a shadow over upcoming immigration negotiations, with some lawmakers threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed. Trump's comments were described as "unkind," "divisive," and "elitist," and have sparked widespread outrage. END OF SUMMARY.
