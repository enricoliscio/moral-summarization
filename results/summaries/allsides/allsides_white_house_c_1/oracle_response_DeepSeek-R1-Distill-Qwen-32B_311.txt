Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump facing criticism for using offensive language towards certain countries and his stance on immigration.

The author uses words like "proposal," "ignored," "threatened," "kill," and "comments" which have moral connotations. I should make sure to include these terms in the summary. The article mentions Trump redirecting focus to Democratic proposals, ignoring questions, and threatening to end DACA. He denies using derogatory terms but still faces backlash.

I also need to highlight the negative reactions, such as "shameful," "abhorrent," "racist," and "divisive." These words show the moral judgment against Trump's actions. Additionally, the summary should mention the congressional and international responses, including demands for apologies and the UN's statement.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll start by stating Trump's denial and redirection, then move to the backlash, his threats, and the ongoing negotiations. I'll end with the implications for immigration policies and the criticism from lawmakers.

Now, I'll structure the summary, making sure to include all the key moral terms and points without going over the word limit. I'll check that each sentence captures an essential part of the story while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: President Trump faced criticism for allegedly using derogatory language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as "shithole countries" during a meeting on immigration. Trump denied the claims, redirecting focus to what he called "unacceptable" Democratic proposals on DACA, a program protecting young undocumented immigrants. He ignored questions about the incident during a White House event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., instead emphasizing diversity and equality. Trump threatened to "kill" DACA unless Democrats agreed to his immigration measures, including a border wall. His comments were condemned as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist" by lawmakers, human rights officials, and the governments of Haiti and El Salvador. Trump rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal, calling it insufficient, and accused Democrats of opposing legal immigration from non-white countries. Some Republicans criticized his remarks, while others remained silent. The situation highlights ongoing tensions over immigration policy and accusations of prejudice and racism. END OF SUMMARY.
