SUMMARY: President Trump has caused a global and congressional backlash by reportedly questioning why the U.S. would accept immigrants from "shithole countries" like Haiti and Africa. Trump denied using such language, but his comments have been condemned as racist and abhorrent by lawmakers and human rights officials. The incident occurred during negotiations over the DACA program, which protects young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump has threatened to kill the program unless Democrats agree to new security measures, including a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. His comments have been described as divisive, elitist, and flying in the face of American values. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador have demanded explanations and apologies. Despite Trump's denial, lawmakers who were present at the meeting confirmed the use of abhorrent and repulsive language. The incident has sparked further criticism of Trump's immigration stance, with Democrats accusing him of favoring immigration from predominantly white countries while blocking it from black and brown countries. Some congressional Democrats have even threatened to block government spending unless DACA is addressed. Trump's comments and his rejection of a bipartisan proposal on DACA have been framed as unacceptable and lacking merit.
END OF SUMMARY.
