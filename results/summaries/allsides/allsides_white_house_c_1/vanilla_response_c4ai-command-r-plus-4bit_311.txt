SUMMARY: President Trump denied using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries in a tweet on Friday, saying that his language was "tough" but not vulgar. He also sought to shift the focus onto Democratic proposals on immigration, which he deemed unacceptable. Trump ignored questions about the incident during a White House event honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Day, instead emphasizing diversity and equality. The reported comments drew criticism from lawmakers and human rights officials, who denounced them as racist. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and apologies, while a UN human rights spokesman called the comments "shocking and shameful." Some Republicans implicitly rebuked Trump, while others stayed silent. The incident is likely to shadow upcoming negotiations between the White House and Congress on immigration. Trump also rejected a bipartisan proposal on DACA, claiming it lacked funding for the U.S.-Mexico wall. Democrats accused Trump of wanting to block immigration from non-white countries. Some congressional Democrats threatened a government shutdown if DACA is not addressed.
END OF SUMMARY.
