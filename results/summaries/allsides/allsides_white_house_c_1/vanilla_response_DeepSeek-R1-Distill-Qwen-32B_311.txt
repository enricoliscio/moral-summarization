Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments regarding certain countries. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump is facing criticism for using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. He denied using such language and redirected the focus to Democratic immigration proposals. He tweeted that his language was tough but not the one in question, and criticized the DACA proposal as a setback.

Then, during a White House event honoring Martin Luther King Jr., Trump spoke about diversity and equality but avoided questions about the incident. The Washington Post reported that Trump used the term "shithole countries" during a meeting with lawmakers, specifically mentioning Haiti and African countries, and compared it to Norway, which he had met the prime minister of the day before.

Trump later denied saying anything derogatory about Haitians, except acknowledging Haiti's poverty, and suggested recording future meetings. He threatened to end DACA unless Democrats agreed to security measures, including a border wall.

The article also mentions reactions: lawmakers, human rights officials, and foreign governments condemned his comments as racist. Some Democrats accused him of wanting immigration from white countries and blocking others. Republicans were divided, with some rebuking Trump and others staying silent.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump denied using the term, then mention the Washington Post report. Include his redirection to DACA and criticism of Democrats. Then, note the reactions from lawmakers, UN, and foreign governments. Mention the threat to end DACA and the Republican divide. Keep it concise, ensuring all key points are covered without exceeding the word limit.
