Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President Trump's comments regarding Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that Trump denied using a vulgar term but redirected the conversation to immigration proposals. He tweeted about the language used in a meeting, calling it tough but not the one in question. Then, during an event honoring Martin Luther King Jr., he spoke about equality but avoided questions about the incident.

The Washington Post reported that Trump used the term "shithole countries" during a meeting with lawmakers, specifically mentioning Haiti and African countries. Trump later denied this, saying he only criticized Haiti's poverty and suggested recording future meetings.

The article also discusses Trump's stance on DACA and his demand for security measures, including a border wall. The comments sparked criticism from lawmakers and human rights groups, with some calling them racist. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador protested, and the UN condemned the remarks.

Additionally, Trump rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal, citing lack of funding for the wall and other issues. Democrats accused him of favoring immigration from white countries. Some Republicans criticized his comments, while others remained silent.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's denial, the reported comments, the reaction from various groups, and the political implications regarding DACA and immigration policies.

Let me structure it step by step: start with Trump denying the comments, mention the reported remarks, the reactions from different parties, and the impact on immigration negotiations. Keep it clear and concise.
