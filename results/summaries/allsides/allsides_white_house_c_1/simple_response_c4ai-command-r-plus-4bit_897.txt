SUMMARY: President Trump caused an uproar of criticism and outrage both domestically and internationally after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries in a meeting with lawmakers regarding immigration policies. While Trump denied using the specific language, he did not deny the sentiment behind it, instead redirecting the focus onto Democratic proposals on immigration. The reported comments have been widely condemned as racist and shameful, with lawmakers and human rights officials demanding an apology and clarification. Trump's remarks have also been interpreted as a reflection of his preference for immigration from predominantly white countries over those that are predominantly black and brown. Some Republicans have implicitly rebuked Trump's comments, while others have remained silent. The incident has further strained upcoming negotiations between the White House and Congress on immigration and has raised questions about Trump's commitment to racial equality and diversity.

END OF SUMMARY.
