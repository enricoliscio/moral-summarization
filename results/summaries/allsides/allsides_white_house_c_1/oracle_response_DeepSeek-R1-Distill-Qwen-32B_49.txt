Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed news article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President Trump facing criticism for using a vulgar term to describe certain countries and redirecting the focus to immigration proposals. The key events include Trump denying the use of the term, his tweets, the reactions from lawmakers and the UN, and the ongoing DACA negotiations.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words in the article. The user provided a list, so I'll make sure to include terms like "proposal," "ignored," "threatened," "kill," "comments," "shameful," "abhorrent," "unpresidential," "ignorance," "prejudice," "racism," "divisive," "shocking," "rejected," "crime," "allow," "block," "opposes," "stop," "care," "repulsive."

I'll structure the summary to cover Trump's denial, the reported comments, the reactions from various groups, and the implications on immigration negotiations. I'll use the moral terms to highlight the negative aspects of Trump's actions and the criticism he received.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. I'll start by stating Trump's denial and the context of the meeting. Then, mention the criticism from lawmakers, the UN, and other countries. Finally, touch on the impact on DACA negotiations and the bipartisan proposal.

I need to ensure that the moral framing is clear, using words like "shameful," "abhorrent," "racism," and "divisive" to convey the negative sentiment. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article and stick strictly to summarizing the given content.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure all key points are included and that the moral terms are appropriately used. I'll also check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump denied using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, instead focusing on what he called "unacceptable" Democratic immigration proposals. During a meeting with lawmakers, Trump reportedly questioned why the U.S. accepts immigrants from "shithole countries" like Haiti or Africa, rather than places like Norway. He later tweeted that he never said anything derogatory about Haitians, calling Haiti a "very poor and troubled country." Trump threatened to "kill" the DACA program unless Democrats agreed to new security measures, including a border wall. His comments drew widespread criticism, with lawmakers and human rights officials denouncing them as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist." Rep. Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, called his remarks "unkind, divisive, and elitist." The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations, while the U.N. called the comments "shocking and shameful." Trump also rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal, blaming Democrats for blocking a "merit-based" system. Some Democrats accused him of opposing legal immigration based on race, with Rep. Luis Gutierrez calling his stance "clearly racist." The controversy overshadowed ongoing negotiations, with some Republicans rebuking Trump for his "repulsive" language. END OF SUMMARY.
