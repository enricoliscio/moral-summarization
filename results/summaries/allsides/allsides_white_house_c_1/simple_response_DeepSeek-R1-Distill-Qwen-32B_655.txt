Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump facing criticism for using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. He denied using the term and redirected blame to the Democrats' immigration proposals. There's mention of the DACA program, which he wants to end unless certain security measures are agreed upon, including a border wall. The Washington Post reported his comments, and several lawmakers and human rights officials condemned his remarks as racist. Some Democrats are threatening to block government spending unless DACA is addressed, risking a shutdown. Trump accused Democrats of wanting to prioritize immigration from predominantly white countries. Some Republicans criticized Trump's comments, citing the importance of diversity and equality, referencing Martin Luther King Jr.'s values.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Trump's denial, the context of the DACA meeting, the criticism from lawmakers and international governments, the threat of a government shutdown, and the Republican responses. I must preserve the moral framing, so I'll highlight the accusations of racism and the impact on immigration policies.

Let me structure the summary: start with Trump denying the use of the term, mention the context of the DACA meeting, the accusations of racism, the congressional reactions, the threat of shutdown, and conclude with the broader implications on immigration policies and equality.

I need to ensure that the moral aspects are clear, like the criticism for racism and the divide on immigration policies. I should also mention the bipartisan proposal and Trump's rejection of it, as well as the potential government shutdown.

I think that's a solid structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's concise and within the word limit.
