SUMMARY:
President Trump faced intense backlash after allegedly making derogatory remarks about Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. While discussing immigration, Trump reportedly questioned why the US would accept immigrants from "shithole countries," sparking outrage from lawmakers, human rights officials, and foreign governments. Trump denied using such language, calling his own words "tough" but not vulgar. He shifted the focus to Democratic proposals on immigration, which he deemed unacceptable. Lawmakers and human rights officials condemned Trump's comments as shameful, abhorrent, racist, and unpresidential. Rep. Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, called for an apology, describing the comments as unkind, divisive, and elitist. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and protests, respectively. Despite Trump's denial and attempts to redirect the narrative, his comments overshadowed upcoming negotiations on immigration and prompted implicit rebukes from some Republicans. Democrats accused Trump of seeking to block immigration from non-white countries, while some Republicans highlighted contributions made by individuals of Haitian descent. Sen. Jeff Flake directly contradicted Trump's denial, calling his remarks abhorrent and repulsive. The incident highlighted the moral implications of Trump's immigration stance and further polarized the debate surrounding DACA.
