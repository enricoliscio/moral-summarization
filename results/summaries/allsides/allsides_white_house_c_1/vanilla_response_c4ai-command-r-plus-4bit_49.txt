SUMMARY: President Trump faced intense backlash after allegedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries in a DACA meeting. While Trump denied using the specific language, he did not deny the sentiment and instead shifted the focus to Democratic immigration proposals. The incident sparked outrage from lawmakers and human rights officials, who denounced the comments as racist and unpresidential. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and apologies. Trump's subsequent tweets rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal and blamed Democrats for the impasse. Some Republicans rebuked Trump, while others remained silent. The controversy comes as Congress and the White House prepare for negotiations on immigration, with some Democrats threatening to block a new government spending plan if DACA is not addressed.
END OF SUMMARY.
