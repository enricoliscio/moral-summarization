SUMMARY:

President Trump has faced backlash from Congress and globally after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead blaming Democrats for proposing "unacceptable" immigration ideas. He also tweeted that he would record future meetings to prove his innocence. Lawmakers and human rights officials have condemned Trump's comments as racist and shameful. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador have demanded explanations, and the UN has called the comments "shocking and shameful." Trump has threatened to end the DACA program unless Democrats agree to new security measures, including a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The incident has sparked outrage, with some Republicans implicitly rebuking Trump and Democrats threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed.
