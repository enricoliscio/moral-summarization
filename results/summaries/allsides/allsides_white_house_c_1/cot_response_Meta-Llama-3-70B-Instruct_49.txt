SUMMARY:
President Trump faced backlash for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. He denied using the term, instead redirecting focus to Democratic proposals on immigration. Trump's comments were denounced as "shameful," "abhorrent," "unpresidential," and "racist" by lawmakers and human rights officials. The government of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations, with the UN calling the comments "shocking" and "racist." Trump also rejected a bipartisan congressional proposal on DACA, saying it lacked funding for the U.S.-Mexico wall. Democrats argued that Trump's goal is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The controversy has sparked outrage, with some Republicans implicitly rebuking Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
