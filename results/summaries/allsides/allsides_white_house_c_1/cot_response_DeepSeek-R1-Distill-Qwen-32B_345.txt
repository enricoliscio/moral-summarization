Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with moral framing. They provided a detailed article about Trump's comments and the reactions. First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

I see words like "firestorm," "vulgar," "unacceptable," "derogatory," "shameful," "abhorrent," "unpresidential," "condemnation," "unkind," "divisive," "elitist," "racist," "shocking," "ignorance," "prejudice," "respect," "merit-based," "oppose," "sweetheart deal," "ire," "abhorrent," "repulsive." These all carry strong moral connotations.

Next, I need to summarize the article, keeping these words in. I'll start by mentioning Trump's denial of using vulgar terms, redirecting focus to Democratic proposals. Then, I'll note his comments about "shithole countries" and the backlash. Include the reactions from lawmakers, the UN, and other countries. Also, mention the ongoing DACA debate and the government shutdown threat.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it too long. I'll structure it to flow from Trump's actions to the reactions, highlighting the moral issues involved.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Okay, that should cover all the necessary points while maintaining the ethical context.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump faced criticism after reports emerged that he used a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a DACA meeting. Trump denied the allegations, calling the language "tough but not derogatory," and redirected focus to what he called "unacceptable" Democratic immigration proposals. He also criticized a bipartisan DACA plan, claiming it failed to address security measures like a border wall. Lawmakers and human rights officials condemned his comments as racist and abhorrent, with some calling for an apology. The government of Haiti demanded an explanation, while El Salvador lodged a protest. Trump's remarks sparked widespread condemnation, with critics accusing him of promoting a merit-based immigration system that favors predominantly white countries like Norway over others. Democrats accused him of opposing legal immigration based on race, while some Republicans rebuked his comments. The ongoing DACA debate and potential government shutdown further complicated the situation, with Trump threatening to cut funding for troops unless DACA was addressed. END OF SUMMARY.
