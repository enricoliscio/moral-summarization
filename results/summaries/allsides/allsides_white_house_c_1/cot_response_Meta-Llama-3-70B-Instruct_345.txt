SUMMARY:
President Trump faced backlash from lawmakers and human rights officials after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. Trump denied making the comment, calling it "tough" but not derogatory. However, many condemned his alleged words as "shameful," "abhorrent," "racist," and "repulsive." Lawmakers and officials from Haiti, El Salvador, and the UN demanded an explanation and apology. Trump instead shifted focus to Democratic proposals on immigration, calling them "outlandish" and "unacceptable." The controversy has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration, with some lawmakers threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed. Trump's comments were widely criticized as "unkind," "divisive," and "elitist," and have sparked concerns about his views on race and immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
