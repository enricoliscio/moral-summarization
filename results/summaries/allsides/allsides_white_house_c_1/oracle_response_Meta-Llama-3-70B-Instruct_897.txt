SUMMARY:

President Trump faced intense criticism for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, sparking accusations of racism. Trump denied using the term, instead redirecting focus to what he called "unacceptable Democratic proposals on immigration." However, his attempt to clarify was met with widespread condemnation from lawmakers, human rights officials, and governments of Haiti and El Salvador. Trump's comments were deemed "shameful," "abhorrent," and "unpresidential" by many, with some labeling them "racist." The president's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. Trump's remarks have cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration, with some lawmakers threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed. The incident has sparked a firestorm of criticism, with many calling for Trump to apologize and take responsibility for his "unkind, divisive, and elitist" comments.
