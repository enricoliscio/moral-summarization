Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about President Trump's comments and the reactions. They want a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump denied using a vulgar term but redirected blame to the Democrats' proposals. He was criticized for his comments, which were called racist and abhorrent. There were reactions from lawmakers, the UN, and other countries. The DACA program was a focal point, and there were threats of government shutdowns.

Now, I need to extract the key events and the moral language. Words like "shameful," "racist," "abhorrent," "ignorance," "prejudice," "divisive," etc., are important to include. I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's actions and the negative reactions, making sure to use those terms.

I'll start by mentioning Trump's denial and redirection. Then, the criticism from lawmakers and organizations. Include the UN's statement about racism. Mention the government shutdown threat and the bipartisan proposal. Also, note the Republican responses, like Rubio and Flake, to show some pushback.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence includes the moral framing where applicable. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points and terms are included without being too wordy.

SUMMARY: President Trump faced criticism for allegedly using derogatory language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as "shithole countries" during a meeting about immigration. He denied the claims, redirecting focus to what he called "unacceptable" Democratic proposals on DACA, a program protecting young undocumented immigrants. Trump ignored questions about the incident during a White House event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., instead emphasizing diversity and equality. Lawmakers and human rights officials condemned his comments as racist, shameful, and abhorrent. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham called them "unpresidential," while Rep. Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, demanded an apology, labeling the remarks "unkind, divisive, and elitist." The governments of Haiti and El Salvador protested, with the UN calling the comments "shocking and shameful." Trump rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal, blaming Democrats for failing to address border security and crime. Some Democrats accused him of opposing legal immigration based on race, favoring predominantly white countries like Norway. The White House threatened to shut down the government over DACA, while some Republicans criticized Trump's remarks, with Sen. Marco Rubio highlighting contributions from Haitian-Americans and Sen. Jeff Flake calling the language "abhorrent and repulsive." END OF SUMMARY.
