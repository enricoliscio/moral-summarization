SUMMARY:

President Trump is facing backlash for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead blaming Democrats for proposing "unacceptable" immigration policies. The incident has sparked widespread criticism, with many labeling Trump's comments as racist and unbecoming of a president. Lawmakers from both parties, as well as the governments of Haiti and El Salvador, have condemned Trump's remarks. The UN has also weighed in, calling the comments "shocking and shameful." Trump's attempt to redirect the focus on Democratic proposals on immigration has fallen flat, with many accusing him of trying to block immigration from predominantly black and brown countries. The incident has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration and has sparked calls for Trump to apologize.
