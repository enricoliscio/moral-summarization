Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump facing criticism for using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. He denied using such language and redirected the focus to the Democratic immigration proposals. He mentioned that the language at the DACA meeting was tough but not the one he used. He also talked about diversity and equality during a White House event honoring Martin Luther King Jr.

The Washington Post reported that Trump referred to "shithole countries" during a meeting with lawmakers, questioning why the U.S. accepts immigrants from these countries instead of places like Norway. Trump denied making derogatory comments about Haitians, saying he only pointed out that Haiti is poor and troubled. He also mentioned recording future meetings.

Trump threatened to end DACA unless Democrats agreed to security measures, including a border wall. The comments sparked criticism from lawmakers, human rights officials, and the governments of Haiti and El Salvador, calling them racist. Some Democrats accused Trump of wanting immigration from predominantly white countries. Republicans were divided, with some rebuking Trump and others staying silent.

So, the summary needs to capture Trump's denial, the reported comments, the criticism, and the impact on immigration negotiations. It should highlight the moral issues like racism and divisiveness.

I should structure the summary to first mention Trump's denial, then the reported comments, followed by the criticism from various groups, and conclude with the implications for immigration talks. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring the moral framing is clear.
