SUMMARY:
President Trump is facing intense backlash after reportedly using vulgar and racist language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a DACA meeting. Trump denied using such language and instead shifted the focus to Democratic proposals on immigration, which he deemed unacceptable. The Washington Post reported that Trump questioned why the US would accept immigrants from "shithole countries," with lawmakers and human rights officials denouncing his comments as racist and abhorrent. Trump's remarks sparked outrage, with lawmakers calling for an apology and the governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanding explanations and lodging protests. Despite Trump's attempts to redirect the narrative, his comments have cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration and prompted some Republicans to implicitly rebuke him. Democrats accused Trump of wanting to block immigration from predominantly black and brown countries, favoring instead immigrants from predominantly white countries like Norway. The incident underscores the tense debate surrounding immigration policy and raises concerns about the moral implications of the President's language and intentions.
