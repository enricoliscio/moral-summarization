SUMMARY:

President Trump is facing backlash from lawmakers and human rights officials after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting on immigration. Trump denied using the term, instead blaming Democrats for proposing "unacceptable" immigration plans. The reported comments have been denounced as racist and shameful, with lawmakers and the government of Haiti demanding an explanation. Trump has threatened to end the DACA program unless Democrats agree to new security measures, including a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The controversy has sparked outrage, with some Republicans implicitly rebuking Trump and others staying silent. The incident has overshadowed upcoming negotiations on immigration, with Democrats threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed.
