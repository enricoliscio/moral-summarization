SUMMARY: President Trump denied using a vulgar term to refer to Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, amid widespread criticism over his remarks. Trump's comments, in which he questioned why the US would accept immigrants from these "shithole countries," were condemned as racist and shameful by lawmakers, human rights officials, and foreign governments. Despite his denial, Trump's comments reflect his preference for immigration from predominantly white countries over those that are predominantly black or brown. Some Republicans implicitly rebuked Trump, while others remained silent. The incident underscores Trump's controversial stance on immigration and his administration's focus on implementing stricter border security measures.

END OF SUMMARY.
