SUMMARY: President Trump denied using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, despite widespread criticism. He redirected the focus to what he called unacceptable Democratic "proposals" on immigration. Trump's reported comments, which lawmakers and human rights officials denounced as "shameful", "abhorrent", and "racist", have sparked outrage globally. The government of Haiti demanded an explanation, while El Salvador lodged a protest. Trump's "rejection" of a bipartisan congressional proposal on DACA was criticized by Democrats as an attempt to allow immigration from predominantly white countries while "blocking" it from predominantly black and brown countries. Some Republicans "implicitly rebuked" Trump, while others remained silent. The incident has overshadowed upcoming negotiations between the White House and Congress on immigration, with some Democrats threatening to "block" a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed, risking a government shutdown.
END OF SUMMARY.
