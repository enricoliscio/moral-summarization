SUMMARY:

President Trump faced backlash after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, sparking accusations of racism. Trump denied using the term, instead redirecting focus to what he called "unacceptable" Democratic proposals on immigration. However, his tweets and statements were widely condemned as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "unpresidential." Lawmakers and human rights officials denounced his comments as "racist" and "divisive," with some demanding an apology. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador also protested, with the UN calling the comments "shocking" and "racist" if confirmed. Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The controversy threatens to overshadow upcoming negotiations on immigration, with some lawmakers vowing to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed. Trump's comments were widely rebuked by lawmakers, with some Republicans implicitly criticizing him. END OF SUMMARY.
