Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I also have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The user mentioned that I should act as both a news summarizer and a moral expert. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about President Trump facing criticism after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a DACA meeting. The Washington Post reported that he used the term "shithole countries." Trump denied using derogatory language, specifically about Haitians, and redirected blame to the Democrats for their immigration proposals. He also mentioned that he might start recording future meetings.

There's a lot of reaction from different groups. Lawmakers, human rights officials, and even other countries like Haiti and El Salvador are denouncing his comments as racist. Some Democrats are accusing Trump of wanting to prioritize immigration from white countries like Norway over others. There are mentions of possible government shutdowns if DACA isn't addressed, which Trump is against unless certain security measures are met.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key events: Trump's reported comments, his denial, the reactions, and the implications for immigration policy. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”critics see his comments as racist and against American values, while Trump is trying to shift the focus to policy disagreements.

I should structure the summary to first mention the incident, then Trump's denial, followed by the reactions from various groups, and end with the implications for immigration talks. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I need to be concise but thorough.

I should avoid any personal opinions beyond what's stated in the article. The summary should reflect the moral criticism clearly, showing how Trump's comments were condemned as racist and harmful, while Trump defended his stance on immigration policy.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.
