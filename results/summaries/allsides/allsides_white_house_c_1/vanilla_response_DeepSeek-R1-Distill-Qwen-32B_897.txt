Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Trump and his comments regarding Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. The user wants a concise summary of about 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems that Trump was criticized for using a vulgar term to describe certain countries. He denied using that language and redirected the focus to the Democratic immigration proposals. The Washington Post reported that he used the term "shithole countries" during a meeting about DACA. Trump later denied the specifics, saying he only criticized Haiti as poor and troubled. He also mentioned recording future meetings. 

The article mentions that Democrats and human rights officials condemned his comments as racist. Lawmakers and foreign governments, like Haiti and El Salvador, reacted negatively. Trump criticized the bipartisan DACA proposal, blaming Democrats and wanting a merit-based system. Some Republicans defended him, while others criticized his comments. There's also a mention of potential government shutdowns over DACA funding.

I need to condense all this into a summary. I should include Trump's denial, the reported comments, the reactions, his stance on DACA, and the political implications. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, starting with the key points and then the reactions and political fallout.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each important detail is included without going over the word limit. I'll also make sure to use clear and concise language, avoiding any markdown as per the user's request.
