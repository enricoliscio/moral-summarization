Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral implications.

The article is about President Trump facing criticism for his remarks about "shithole countries," specifically Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations. He denied using the term but redirected blame to Democrats' immigration proposals. The moral framing here includes words like "shameful," "abhorrent," "racist," etc. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of these words as possible.

I'll start by identifying the key events: Trump's denial, redirection to DACA, criticism from lawmakers, UN's reaction, and the impact on immigration negotiations. I need to include the morally charged words to reflect the author's tone.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's actions and the reactions. Make sure to mention the specific countries and the terms used. Also, include the responses from Democrats, the UN, and the implications for DACA and immigration policies.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all necessary moral terms. Let me draft the summary, ensuring each sentence includes the relevant moral framing without making it too lengthy.

I should also check that the summary flows logically, starting from Trump's remarks, his denial, the criticism, and the broader implications. Make sure to mention the bipartisan proposal and Trump's rejection, as well as the potential government shutdown threat.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it includes all the required moral words and accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

SUMMARY:  
President Trump faced widespread criticism for allegedly using the term "shithole countries" to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations during a meeting about immigration. Trump denied the claim, calling the language "tough but not derogatory," and redirected focus to what he called "unacceptable" Democratic proposals on DACA. He threatened to "kill" the DACA program unless Democrats agreed to new security measures, including a border wall. Critics, including lawmakers and human rights officials, denounced his comments as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist." Rep. Mia Love, a Haitian immigrant, demanded an apology, calling the remarks "divisive" and "elitist." The governments of Haiti and El Salvador protested, while the UN called the comments "shocking" and "repulsive." Trump rejected a bipartisan DACA proposal, citing insufficient funding for the wall and opposition to "chain migration." Democrats accused him of opposing legal immigration based on race, favoring predominantly white countries like Norway. The situation could lead to a government shutdown if DACA isn't addressed, with Trump warning Democrats not to "stop paying our troops" for a "sweetheart deal." Some Republicans criticized Trump's language, with Sen. Marco Rubio highlighting contributions by Haitian immigrants and Sen. Jeff Flake calling the remarks "abhorrent." END OF SUMMARY.
