SUMMARY: President Trump has caused moral outrage by referring to Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as "shithole countries" and expressing preference for immigrants from predominantly white countries such as Norway. His comments, made during a meeting with lawmakers on the DACA program, have been widely condemned as racist and abhorrent by lawmakers, human rights officials, and foreign governments. While Trump denied using the vulgar term, his comments reflect a clear moral stance on immigration that prioritizes skin color and country of origin over merit. This incident has sparked a moral debate about the values that should guide US immigration policy, with critics arguing that Trump's views are antithetical to American values of equality and diversity. The controversy also highlights the tension between the President's hardline stance on immigration and the need for bipartisan compromise on issues like DACA. Trump's comments have been seen as a setback for efforts to find common ground between the White House and Congress on immigration reform and risk further polarizing an already divided nation.
END OF SUMMARY.
