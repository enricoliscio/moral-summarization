Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. I should make sure to use as many of those as possible without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Trump is facing criticism for his comments about "shithole countries." He denied using the term but redirected blame to Democratic proposals on immigration. The article mentions his tweets, his statements during the Martin Luther King Jr. event, and the reactions from lawmakers and other countries.

I should start by stating Trump's denial and redirection. Then, mention the reported comments about Haiti and African countries, using words like "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist." Include the reactions from lawmakers and the UN, using terms like "condemned," "ignorance," and "prejudice."

Next, explain Trump's stance on DACA, using words like "kill," "oppose," and "block." Highlight the Democrats' accusations of racism and his threat to shut down the government. Finally, note the mixed reactions from Republicans and the UN's statement.

I need to weave in the morally charged words naturally. Words like "proposal," "ignored," "threatened," "kill," "comments," "shameful," "abhorrent," "ignorance," "prejudice," "racism," "divisive," "shocking," "rejected," "crime," "allow," "block," "opposes," "stop," "care," "used," "repulsive."

I'll structure the summary to cover Trump's denial, the reported comments, the reactions, his immigration stance, the accusations, and the broader implications. Make sure each sentence includes a moral term without forcing it. Keep the flow natural and concise.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each point is covered succinctly and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: President Trump denied using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, redirecting focus to what he called unacceptable Democratic immigration proposals. He claimed his language at a DACA meeting was "tough but not derogatory," dismissing reports of his alleged comments about "shithole countries." Trump ignored questions about the incident during a White House event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., instead emphasizing diversity and equality. However, his reported remarks were condemned as shameful, abhorrent, and racist by lawmakers, human rights officials, and the UN. Democrats accused Trump of opposing legal immigration from predominantly black and brown countries, favoring predominantly white nations like Norway. Trump threatened to kill the DACA program unless Democrats agreed to new security measures, including a border wall. Some Republicans criticized his comments, with Sen. Rubio highlighting contributions from Haitian immigrants and Sen. Flake calling the remarks repulsive. The controversy overshadowed negotiations over immigration reform, with Democrats threatening to block a spending plan unless DACA was addressed. Trump accused Democrats of prioritizing DACA over troop funding, while critics accused him of promoting a merit-based system that excludes certain countries based on race. END OF SUMMARY.
