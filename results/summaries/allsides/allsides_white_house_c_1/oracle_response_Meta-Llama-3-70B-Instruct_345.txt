SUMMARY:

President Trump faced intense criticism for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. He denied making the comments, instead redirecting focus to what he called "unacceptable Democratic proposals on immigration." Trump's attempt to clarify came after The Washington Post reported that he questioned why the U.S. would accept immigrants from "shithole countries" like Haiti or in Africa rather than in places like Norway. Lawmakers and human rights officials denounced his comments as "racist," "shameful," and "abhorrent." Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, demanded Trump apologize, calling his comments "unkind, divisive, and elitist." The government of Haiti and El Salvador also condemned the remarks. Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The controversy has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the White House and Congress on immigration.
