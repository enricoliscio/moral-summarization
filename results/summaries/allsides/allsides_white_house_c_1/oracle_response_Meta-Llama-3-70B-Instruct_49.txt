SUMMARY:

President Trump faced a global backlash after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. He denied using the term, instead redirecting focus to what he called unacceptable Democratic proposals on immigration. Trump's comments were denounced as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist" by lawmakers and human rights officials. The government of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations, and the UN human rights spokesman called the comments "shocking" and "shameful." Trump rejected a bipartisan congressional proposal on DACA, saying it lacked funding for the U.S.-Mexico wall and did not end programs like "chain migration." Democrats accused Trump of opposing legal immigration from predominantly black and brown countries. Trump's goal is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from others. His comments were deemed "unkind," "divisive," and "elitist," and flew in the face of the nation's values. Trump's denial and redirection did little to quell the outrage, with many calling for an apology and condemning his remarks as "repulsive."
