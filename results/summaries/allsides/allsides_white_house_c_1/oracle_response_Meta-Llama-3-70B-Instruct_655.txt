SUMMARY:

President Trump faced a global backlash after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, sparking accusations of racism. Trump denied using the term, instead shifting the focus to "unacceptable" Democratic proposals on immigration. However, his attempt to clarify was met with widespread condemnation, with lawmakers and human rights officials denouncing his comments as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist." The President's remarks were deemed "unkind," "divisive," and "elitist" by Rep. Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and lodged protests, while a UN human rights spokesman called the comments "shocking" and "racist." Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The incident has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration, with some lawmakers threatening to block a new government spending plan unless the DACA program is addressed.
