SUMMARY:

President Trump is facing backlash for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead blaming Democrats for proposing "unacceptable" immigration policies. However, lawmakers and human rights officials have condemned Trump's comments as racist and shameful. The government of Haiti and El Salvador have demanded explanations, and a UN human rights spokesman called the comments "shocking and shameful." Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The incident has sparked outrage, with many calling for Trump to apologize and condemning his comments as unbecoming of a president. The controversy is likely to overshadow upcoming negotiations on immigration and DACA.
