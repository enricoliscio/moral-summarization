SUMMARY:
President Trump caused a moral firestorm of criticism for his use of vulgar language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as "shithole countries." While Trump denied using such language, calling it "tough" but not vulgar, his comments were condemned as unacceptable, abhorrent, and unpresidential by lawmakers and human rights officials. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, demanded strong condemnation of Trump's statement, while Rep. Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, called his remarks unkind, divisive, and elitist. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and apologies. A UN human rights spokesman called Trump's comments shocking and racist. In response, Trump redirected the focus to what he called unacceptable Democratic proposals on immigration, rejecting a bipartisan proposal for the DACA program as it lacked funding for the US-Mexico wall and did not end "chain migration." Some Republicans, like Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Jeff Flake, implicitly rebuked Trump, with Flake calling his words "abhorrent and repulsive." Trump's comments sparked outrage and raised concerns about his administration's stance on immigration and racial equality.
