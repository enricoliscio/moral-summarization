SUMMARY:

President Trump has faced backlash from Congress and the global community after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead shifting focus to what he called unacceptable Democratic proposals on immigration. He tweeted that the language used was "tough" but not derogatory, and suggested he would record future meetings. The reported comments have been denounced as racist by lawmakers and human rights officials, with some demanding an apology. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador have also protested the remarks. Trump has threatened to end the DACA program unless Democrats agree to new security measures, including a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The controversy is likely to overshadow upcoming negotiations on immigration.
