Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral language used. The article is about President Trump's comments regarding immigrants from certain countries, which has sparked a lot of criticism.

I remember the user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to look for words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "shameful," "abhorrent," "unpresidential," "condemnation," "unkind," "divisive," "elitist," "ignorance," "prejudice," "racism," "shocking," "shameful," "racist," "shutdown," "troops," "country," "first," "sweetheart deal," "fair deal," "merit-based," "oppose," "look," "certain way," "certain countries," "predominantly white," "black," "brown," "chain migration," "high crime countries," "doing badly," "respect," "dignity," "noble," "brave," "slander," "peaceable," "considerate," "graciousness," "troops," "government workers," "first."

Now, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should cover Trump's denial of using the term "shithole countries," his focus on immigration proposals, the criticism from lawmakers and human rights groups, the impact on DACA negotiations, and the broader implications of his comments.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as racism, divisiveness, and the impact on immigration policies. I'll mention the reactions from various lawmakers, the UN, and the governments of Haiti and El Salvador. Also, include Trump's stance on a merit-based system and the potential government shutdown.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Trump's comments, the reactions, the implications for DACA, and the broader debate on immigration. I'll use the morally framed words to convey the severity of the situation and the various criticisms.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Trump faced widespread criticism after reports emerged that he referred to Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as "shithole countries" during immigration discussions. Trump denied using derogatory language, redirecting focus to what he called "outlandish" Democratic proposals on DACA, a program protecting young undocumented immigrants. His comments were condemned as "shameful," "abhorrent," and "racist" by lawmakers, human rights officials, and the UN. Rep. Mia Love, a Haitian-American, called his remarks "unkind, divisive, and elitist." The Haitian and Salvadoran governments demanded explanations, while Trump accused Democrats of blocking a "merit-based" immigration system. He criticized a bipartisan DACA proposal, claiming it favored "high crime countries," sparking accusations of racial bias. Some Republicans criticized Trump, while others remained silent. The situation escalated tensions over immigration reform and risked a government shutdown. Trump emphasized prioritizing troops and the country over DACA, but critics accused him of seeking a sweetheart deal for immigrants from predominantly white nations.
