SUMMARY: President Trump sparked outrage with his derogatory comments about Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, referring to them as "shithole countries." Despite his denial and attempt to shift the focus to Democratic proposals on immigration, his remarks were widely condemned as racist and abhorrent. The incident occurred during a meeting with lawmakers regarding the DACA program, with Trump questioning why the US accepts immigrants from these nations. Trump's comments were criticized by lawmakers, human rights officials, and foreign governments, with some demanding an apology and an explanation. The incident also drew implicit rebuke from some Republicans, while others remained silent. Trump's criticism extended to a bipartisan congressional proposal on DACA, which he rejected due to the lack of funding for the US-Mexico wall and the continuation of "chain migration." The incident highlights Trump's controversial stance on immigration and raises concerns about racial bias in his policies.
