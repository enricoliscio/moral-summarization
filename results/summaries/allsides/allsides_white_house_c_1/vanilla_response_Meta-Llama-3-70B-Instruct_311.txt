SUMMARY:

President Trump has faced backlash from Congress and globally after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead blaming Democrats for proposing "unacceptable" immigration plans. He tweeted that the language used was "tough" but not derogatory, and suggested he would record future meetings. The reported comments have been denounced as racist by lawmakers and human rights officials, with some demanding an apology. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador have also demanded explanations and lodged protests. Trump has threatened to kill the DACA program unless Democrats agree to new security measures, including a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The incident is likely to shadow upcoming immigration negotiations between the White House and Congress.
