SUMMARY: President Trump has denied using vulgar language to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries in a meeting with lawmakers on immigration. He claimed that his comments were "tough" but not vulgar and criticized a Democratic proposal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as a "big setback." Trump's alleged comments sparked widespread criticism, with lawmakers and human rights officials denouncing them as racist. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and apologies. Despite Trump's denial, some congressional Democrats have threatened to block a new government spending plan unless DACA is addressed, risking a government shutdown. Trump has blamed Democrats for the impasse and pushed for a "merit-based" immigration system that blocks entry from "high-crime countries." Some Republicans implicitly rebuked Trump, while others remained silent. The incident has overshadowed upcoming negotiations between the White House and Congress on immigration.
END OF SUMMARY.
