SUMMARY: President Trump has denied using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, despite facing intense criticism from lawmakers and human rights officials who denounced his comments as racist, divisive, shocking, and shameful. Trump's reported remarks have sparked outrage, with some demanding an apology and an explanation. The president's comments came during a meeting on the DACA program, where he questioned why the U.S. would accept immigrants from "shithole countries." In his denial, Trump claimed that his language was "tough" but not derogatory, and shifted the focus to Democratic proposals on immigration, which he rejected as unacceptable. The bipartisan proposal on DACA was criticized by Trump for lacking funding for the U.S.-Mexico wall and failing to end "chain migration." Democrats, however, accused Trump of wanting to block immigration from predominantly black and brown countries while favoring immigration from predominantly white countries. Some Republicans implicitly rebuked Trump's comments, while others remained silent. The incident has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations between the White House and Congress on immigration, with the government of Haiti and El Salvador demanding explanations and protests.
END OF SUMMARY.
