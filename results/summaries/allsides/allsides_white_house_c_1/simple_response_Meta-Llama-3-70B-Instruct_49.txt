SUMMARY:

President Trump is facing backlash for reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries during a meeting with lawmakers. Trump denied using the term, instead redirecting focus to Democratic proposals on immigration. However, lawmakers and human rights officials have denounced his comments as racist and shameful. The President's remarks have sparked outrage, with many calling for an apology and condemning his language as unkind, divisive, and elitist. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador have also demanded explanations and lodged protests. Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The incident has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration and has sparked a moral outcry, with many calling for respect, dignity, and equality for all people, regardless of their country of origin.
