SUMMARY:
President Trump faced backlash from lawmakers and human rights officials after reportedly using a vulgar term to describe Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries. Trump denied making the comments, instead calling the Democratic proposals on immigration "outlandish" and "a big setback for DACA!" However, many condemned his alleged remarks as "shameful," "abhorrent," "racist," and "unkind." Lawmakers and officials from Haiti and El Salvador demanded explanations and apologies, with the UN human rights spokesman calling the comments "shocking" and "racist." Trump's goal, according to Democrats, is to allow immigration from predominantly white countries and block it from predominantly black and brown countries. The controversy has cast a shadow over upcoming negotiations on immigration, with some Republicans implicitly rebuking Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
