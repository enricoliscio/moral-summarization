Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about President Trump's recent comments regarding Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries, which have caused a lot of criticism. 

First, the key points I notice: Trump denied using a vulgar term, redirecting focus to immigration proposals. The Washington Post reported him questioning why the U.S. accepts immigrants from "shithole countries" like Haiti or in Africa instead of Norway. He met with the Norwegian PM the day before. 

He tweeted that his language was tough but not derogatory, and he criticized the DACA program. DACA is about protecting young immigrants. Trump wants to end it unless Democrats agree to security measures, including a border wall. 

The article mentions that some lawmakers and human rights officials called his comments racist. The governments of Haiti and El Salvador protested. The UN also condemned it as racist. 

Trump rejected a bipartisan proposal on DACA, saying it didn't fund the wall or end chain migration. Democrats accused him of wanting immigration from white countries and blocking others. There's a threat of a government shutdown if DACA isn't addressed, which Trump criticized. 

Some Republicans rebuked Trump, like Rubio sharing contributions from Haitian-Americans, while Flake called his words abhorrent. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include Trump's denial, the reported comments, the backlash, his criticism of DACA, the accusations of racism, the protests, the UN's statement, his rejection of the proposal, Democratic accusations, the shutdown threat, and some Republican responses.

I'll structure it to start with Trump denying the comments, then the report from the Washington Post, his criticism of DACA, the backlash, the protests, UN's statement, his rejection of the proposal, Democrats' accusations, shutdown threat, and some Republicans' reactions. 

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all main points without being too detailed. Also, keep the language clear and straightforward.
