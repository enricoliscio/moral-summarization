Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, and I need to include as many as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule that allowed healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other services on moral or religious grounds. The judge said the rule overstepped, was based on false claims, and could be costly and damaging. It was also called discriminatory and would interfere with access to healthcare. The HHS rule was described as a solution in search of a problem because the complaints were flatly untrue. The judge warned it could jeopardize vulnerable populations and inhibit healthcare employers. The rule was blocked, and some groups were happy, while others, like Sen. Ben Sasse, were critical.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary using the moral words provided. I'll start by mentioning the judge striking down the rule, using "overstepped" and "based on false claims." I'll note the rule was called "costly," "damaging," "discriminatory," and "interfering." I'll include that the complaints were "untrue" and the rule was a "solution in search of a problem." I'll mention the vulnerable populations being "jeopardized" and how the rule could "inhibit" healthcare employers. Finally, I'll note that the rule was "blocked" and the mixed reactions.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it to flow naturally, highlighting the judge's ruling, the reasoning, and the implications, all while using the moral terms.

SUMMARY: A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other services on moral or religious grounds, calling it "overstepped" and "based on false claims." The judge criticized the rule as "costly," "damaging," and "discriminatory," stating it would "interfere" with access to healthcare. He noted the department's claim of increased complaints was "flatly untrue," labeling the rule a "solution in search of a problem." The rule could "jeopardize" vulnerable populations, including women, LGBT individuals, and those with HIV/AIDS, while also "inhibiting" healthcare employers' ability to manage staff during emergencies. The judge emphasized that HHS lacked authority to impose such measures, leaving it to Congress to "decide" on related laws. The rule was "blocked," with some praising the decision while others, like Sen. Ben Sasse, called it "absurd." END OF SUMMARY.
