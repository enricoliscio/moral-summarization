SUMMARY: A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule that could have allowed more health care workers to refuse to participate in procedures like abortions based on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, stated that the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and went beyond existing law. He highlighted the potential negative consequences of the rule, including costs and burdens, as well as interference with emergency care. Engelmayer also refuted the department's rationale for the rule, claiming that it was based on false claims about a rise in complaints. The ruling blocked the rule from taking effect, with opponents arguing that it would have been discriminatory and interfered with access to healthcare. The decision underscored the importance of leaving decisions about religious objections to Congress, inhibiting employers' ability to organize their workplaces efficiently.
END OF SUMMARY.
