SUMMARY:
A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed more health care workers to refuse to participate in procedures, including abortions, on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, ruled that the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on a lie, as there has not been a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The ruling blocks what critics called a discriminatory measure that would interfere with people's access to health care and inhibit the ability of health care employers to organize their workforce efficiently, particularly in emergencies. The HHS rule was challenged by a coalition of states, local governments, and health organizations who argued that it would have been damaging to emergency care and harmful to vulnerable populations. The Conscience Provisions, first created in 1973, have long protected health care professionals from carrying out services that conflict with their beliefs, but the HHS rule sought to broaden these protections in a way that critics argued went too far. The judge's ruling affirms that HHS lacked the authority to enact such sweeping changes and that any changes to existing law should be left to Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
