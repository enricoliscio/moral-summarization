Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule that allowed healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other services on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, found that the HHS overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on untrue claims about increased complaints. The rule was seen as discriminatory and could harm vulnerable populations.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words like "overstepped," "costly," "damaging," "untrue," "discriminatory," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the judge's ruling, the reasons behind it, and the reactions from different groups.

I'll start by stating the judge's decision, then mention that HHS overstepped and the rule was based on false claims. Next, I'll note that the rule was struck down as discriminatory and could interfere with healthcare access. Include the reaction from Planned Parenthood and the APA, then mention the opposition from Sen. Ben Sasse. Finally, explain how the rule could affect healthcare workers and the judge's warning about staffing issues.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key points are covered with the moral framing intact. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds, stating the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority. The judge called the rule costly, damaging, and based on untrue claims of increased complaints about conscience violations, labeling it a "solution in search of a problem." Critics argued the rule was discriminatory and would interfere with access to healthcare. The HHS rule expanded the list of personnel who could refuse participation, including counselors, trainers, and even receptionists, potentially inhibiting emergency care and forcing employers to increase staff. The judge emphasized that HHS lacked authority to impose such measures and that Congress should decide on religious objection laws. The ruling was praised by health organizations but criticized by Sen. Ben Sasse as "absurd mush." END OF SUMMARY.
