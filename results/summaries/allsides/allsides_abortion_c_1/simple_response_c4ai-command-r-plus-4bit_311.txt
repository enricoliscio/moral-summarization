SUMMARY: A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule that would allow health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, argued that the rule was based on a lie and that the Health and Human Services Department had overstepped its authority. The rule change was opposed by a coalition of states, health organizations, and local governments, who argued that it would be discriminatory and interfere with access to health care. The original Conscience Provisions, created in 1973, already protected health care professionals from carrying out services that conflict with their beliefs. However, the new rule expanded the definition of health care personnel and restricted employers' abilities to inquire about employees' objections. Judge Engelmayer warned that the rule could be costly and burdensome, particularly in emergency situations, and that it should be left to Congress to decide on any changes to the law. The ruling was criticized by Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who urged the administration to appeal, while others, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, praised the decision as a protection for vulnerable populations.
