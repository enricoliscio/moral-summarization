Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, I need to write a summary preserving those moral terms.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "protest," "abortion," "refuse," "morally," "object," "discriminatory," "discrimination," "vulnerable," "jeopardized," "absurd," "mush," "authority," "false," "untrue," "conscience," "objections," "protections," "rights," "freedoms," "ethics," "morality," "justice," and "equality." These words are used to frame the debate around morality and ethics.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article, keeping the moral language intact. The key points are the judge striking down the rule, the HHS overstepping, the impact on healthcare access, and the opposing views. I'll make sure to include terms like "protest," "abortion," "morally," "discriminatory," and "vulnerable" to maintain the moral framing.

I should structure the summary to include the judge's decision, the reasoning behind it, the arguments from both sides, and the implications of the rule. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but thorough.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Let me put it all together, ensuring the moral terms are preserved and the summary is clear and within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule allowing health care workers to refuse participation in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and falsely claimed an increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The rule, which expanded protections for health care workers, was challenged by 19 states, health organizations, and others, who argued it would be discriminatory and hinder access to health care. Critics, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, warned it could harm vulnerable populations, while supporters like Sen. Ben Sasse called the ruling "absurd." The judge emphasized that the rule could disrupt emergency care and that HHS lacked authority to impose such restrictions. The decision preserves existing federal protections while rejecting the broader rule.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
