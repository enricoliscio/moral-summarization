Words like "protest," "abortion," "object," "morals," "conscience," "discriminatory," "access," "vulnerable," "jeopardize," "cover," "discrimination," "false," "absurd," "appeal," "protections," "institutions," "entities," "obligations," "rights," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny," "deny,"
