Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule. The rule allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures for moral or religious reasons. The judge, Paul Engelmayer, said the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on false claims about an increase in complaints. He also mentioned that the rule could be costly and interfere with emergency care.

The rule was set to take effect on November 22, 2019, but was blocked by a lawsuit from 19 states, DC, local governments, and health organizations. They argued it would be discriminatory and hinder access to healthcare. Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association were against it, while Senator Ben Sasse supported the administration's appeal.

The new rule expanded the types of healthcare personnel who could refuse participation, including counselors, trainers, and even receptionists or ambulance drivers. This could force healthcare institutions to hire more staff, especially in emergencies. The judge said HHS didn't have the authority to create the rule, especially the part about cutting federal funding for violations, and that it should be Congress's role.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: who was involved, what the rule was about, the judge's reasoning, the opposition, and the implications of the rule.

Let me structure it: Start with the judge striking down the rule, mention the reason (overstepped authority, false claims), who opposed it, the consequences of the rule, and the judge's comments on Congress's role. Also, note the reaction from both sides.

I should make sure to include that the rule was blocked and the potential impact on healthcare access and costs. Keep it concise, focusing on the main elements without getting too detailed.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse participation in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority and based the rule on false claims of increased complaints. The rule, set to take effect on November 22, was blocked by lawsuits from 19 states, DC, and health organizations, arguing it would be discriminatory and hinder healthcare access. The judge highlighted the rule's potential to increase costs, disrupt emergency care, and allow even non-clinical staff to refuse duties, forcing institutions to hire more staff. The American Psychological Association and Planned Parenthood opposed the rule, while Senator Ben Sasse supported appealing the decision. Engelmayer emphasized that changing laws on religious accommodations should be Congress's role. END OF SUMMARY.
