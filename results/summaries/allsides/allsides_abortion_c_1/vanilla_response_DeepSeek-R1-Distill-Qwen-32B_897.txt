Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule related to healthcare workers refusing to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. 

The main points I should note are:

1. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, ruled that the HHS rule was beyond their authority and based on false claims about increased complaints.
2. The rule allowed more healthcare workers to refuse services, which could affect emergency care and increase costs.
3. The plaintiffs included 19 states, DC, health organizations, etc., arguing it was discriminatory and would hinder access to healthcare.
4. Reactions: Planned Parenthood and APA criticized the rule, while Sen. Ben Sasse supported appealing the decision.
5. The judge pointed out that HHS overstepped and that the rule could lead to staffing issues, especially in emergencies.

I should make sure to include all these elements concisely, keeping the summary under 200 words. I'll structure it to first mention the judge's ruling, then the reasons, the plaintiffs, reactions, and the potential impact on healthcare operations. I need to keep it clear and straightforward without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule allowing more healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Department exceeded its authority and based the rule on false claims of increased complaints. The rule, set to take effect on November 22, was challenged by 19 states, the District of Columbia, health organizations, and others, who argued it would be discriminatory and hinder access to healthcare. The judge criticized the rule as a "solution in search of a problem," noting it could disrupt emergency care and increase costs. Critics, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, welcomed the ruling, while Sen. Ben Sasse called it "absurd" and urged an appeal. The rule expanded the list of personnel who could refuse to participate in procedures, potentially affecting roles like receptionists or ambulance drivers, and could force employers to increase staffing. END OF SUMMARY.
