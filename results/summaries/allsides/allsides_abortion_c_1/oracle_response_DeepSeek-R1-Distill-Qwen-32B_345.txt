Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should reflect the ethical aspects highlighted in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule that allowed healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge found the rule overstepped authority and was based on false claims. There's a lot of moral language here, like "overstepped," "untrue," and "discriminatory."

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those morally framed words as possible. The user provided a list, so I'll check each point to see where these words fit. For example, the judge said the rule was "costly" and "damaging," so I'll include those. The HHS's claim about complaints was "untrue," so that's important.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the judge's decision, then the reasoning behind it, the reaction from both sides, and the implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and maintains the moral perspective. Words like "blocked," "cover," and "discrimination" should be included to show the opposition's stance. The judge's point about the rule being a "solution in search of a problem" is a strong moral critique, so I'll highlight that.

I should also mention the potential impact on vulnerable populations, as that's another moral angle. Including quotes from Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association will add depth to the summary.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by noting the political reaction and the judge's stance on the rule's authority, emphasizing that it's beyond the administration's power. I'll make sure the summary is clear, concise, and retains the moral framing as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds, calling it "costly," "damaging," and based on "untrue" claims. The judge found the U.S. Health and Human Services Department had "overstepped" its authority and created a "solution in search of a problem." Critics argued the rule would be "discriminatory" and interfere with access to healthcare. The rule expanded the list of personnel who could refuse participation, potentially including receptionists or ambulance drivers, which could "inhibit" workplace efficiency. The judge also criticized the rule for being "outside" existing law and warned it could "jeopardize" vulnerable populations. Supporters, like Sen. Ben Sasse, called the ruling "absurd" and urged an appeal. The decision blocks the rule, which opponents saw as providing "legal cover for discrimination." END OF SUMMARY.
