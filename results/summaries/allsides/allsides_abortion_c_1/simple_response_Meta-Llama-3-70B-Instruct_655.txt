SUMMARY:

A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the rule was based on a lie, as there was no evidence of a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The rule would have been costly, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care, and could have jeopardized the health of vulnerable populations, including women, LGBT people, and people with HIV or AIDS. The judge argued that the rule was a "solution in search of a problem" and that the Trump administration had overstepped its authority. The ruling was hailed as a victory for access to healthcare and a blow to discrimination. In contrast, a Republican senator called the ruling "absurd mush" and urged the administration to appeal.
