SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds, citing that it was "based on a lie" and "beyond existing law". The judge ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department "overstepped its authority" and that the measure could be "costly, burdensome and damaging" to emergency care. The rule was deemed "discriminatory" and would have "interfered" with people's access to health care. The judge's decision was hailed by health organizations, who argued that the rule would have "jeopardized" the health of vulnerable populations. In contrast, a Republican senator called the ruling "absurd mush" and urged the administration to appeal. The judge's ruling blocked the rule from taking effect, preventing it from providing "legal cover for discrimination". END OF SUMMARY.
