Okay, I need to summarize the given news article, preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule. The rule allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul Engelmayer, said the HHS overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on false claims about increased complaints. He also mentioned the potential costs and damage to emergency care.

The summary needs to include the key points: the judge's decision, the reasoning behind it, the reaction from different groups, and the implications of the rule. I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective, highlighting both the supporters and opponents of the rule.

I'll structure it by first stating the judge's ruling, then the reasons given, followed by the reactions from HHS, the suing parties, and the political response. I'll also mention the potential consequences of the rule, like the impact on emergency care and vulnerable populations.

Let me make sure to include all these elements concisely, ensuring the moral framing is clear. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language straightforward.

SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department exceeded its authority and based the rule on false claims of increased complaints. He warned the rule could be costly, burdensome, and harmful to emergency care. The rule, which expanded the list of healthcare personnel who could refuse to participate in procedures, was challenged by 19 states, health organizations, and others, who argued it would discriminate and limit access to healthcare. Critics, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, called the rule discriminatory and harmful to vulnerable populations. Supporters, like Sen. Ben Sasse, called the ruling "absurd" and urged an appeal. The judge emphasized that Congress, not HHS, should decide on such matters. END OF SUMMARY.
