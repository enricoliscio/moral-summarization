SUMMARY:

A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the rule was based on a false claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The rule would have been costly, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care, and would have interfered with people's access to health care. The judge argued that the rule was a "solution in search of a problem" and that the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority. The ruling was hailed as a victory for reproductive rights and access to health care, particularly for vulnerable populations such as women, LGBT people, and people with HIV or AIDS. On the other hand, some conservatives criticized the ruling as "absurd mush" and urged the administration to appeal.
