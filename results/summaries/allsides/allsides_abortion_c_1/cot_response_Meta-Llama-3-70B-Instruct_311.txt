SUMMARY:
A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge deemed the rule "flatly untrue" and a "solution in search of a problem," saying it could be "costly, burdensome, and damaging" to emergency care. The rule would have expanded the list of health care personnel who can refuse to participate, including those who counsel, refer, train, or make arrangements for a medical procedure. Critics argued that the rule would be "discriminatory" and interfere with people's access to health care, particularly for "vulnerable" populations such as women, LGBT people, and those with HIV or AIDS. The judge's ruling was hailed as a victory for those who believe in protecting access to health care, while opponents called it "absurd mush." END OF SUMMARY.
