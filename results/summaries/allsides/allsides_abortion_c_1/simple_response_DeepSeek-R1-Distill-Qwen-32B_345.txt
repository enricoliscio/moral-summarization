Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule. The rule allowed healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other procedures based on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul Engelmayer, said the rule was beyond HHS's authority and based on false claims about increased complaints. He also mentioned it could be costly and affect emergency care.

There's a lot of context here. The rule expands the Conscience Provisions, which were originally from 1973. The new rule includes more personnel, like counselors and pharmacists, and restricts employers from inquiring about objections. The judge warned this could disrupt healthcare operations, especially in emergencies, forcing institutions to hire more staff.

The plaintiffs, including 19 states and health organizations, argued the rule was discriminatory and harmful. Planned Parenthood and the APA criticized it, while Sen. Ben Sasse opposed the ruling. The judge emphasized that changing such laws should be Congress's job, not HHS's.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. The main points are the judge's decision, the reasoning (overstepping authority, false claims), the impact on healthcare access, and the opposing views. I should mention the expansion of who can refuse services and the potential costs and discrimination.

I should structure it clearly: start with the judge's ruling, then the reasoning, the implications, and the reactions. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like discrimination and access to care.

Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200. I'll need to be concise but cover all key aspects without losing the moral angle.

SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds, calling it a "solution in search of a problem" based on false claims. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) overstepped its authority and that the rule would be costly, burdensome, and harmful to emergency care. The rule, which expanded the list of personnel who could refuse to participate in such procedures, including counselors and pharmacists, was challenged by 19 states, health organizations, and others who argued it would discriminate and hinder access to care. The judge warned it could disrupt healthcare operations, forcing institutions to hire more staff during emergencies. Critics, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, called the rule harmful, while Sen. Ben Sasse criticized the ruling as "absurd." The judge emphasized that Congress, not HHS, should decide on such laws. END OF SUMMARY.
