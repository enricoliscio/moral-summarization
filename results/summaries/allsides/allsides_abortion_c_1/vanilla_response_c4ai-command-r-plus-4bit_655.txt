SUMMARY: A federal judge in New York struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed more health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The ruling stated that the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on false claims of increased complaints. The rule was challenged by multiple states, health organizations, and advocacy groups, who argued that it would interfere with access to health care and enable discrimination. The decision was praised by Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, while a Republican senator criticized it. The original Conscience Provisions, created in 1973, protected health care professionals from carrying out services that conflicted with their beliefs, but the new rule expanded this to a broader range of health care personnel and restricted employer inquiries. The judge warned of potential burdens and disruptions to emergency care and emphasized the need for Congress to decide on any changes to existing law. 

END OF SUMMARY.
