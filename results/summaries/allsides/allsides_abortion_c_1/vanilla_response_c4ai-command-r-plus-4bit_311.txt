SUMMARY: A federal judge in New York has struck down a new Trump administration rule that would allow more health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, stated that the rule was based on a false claim of increased complaints and that the Department of Health and Human Services had overstepped its authority in issuing the rule. The ruling comes as a result of a lawsuit filed by nineteen states, health organizations, and others who argued that the rule would be discriminatory and interfere with access to healthcare. The rule would have expanded the types of health care personnel who can refuse to participate and restrict employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. Judge Engelmayer warned that the rule could be costly and burdensome, particularly for emergency care, and that it could inhibit workplace efficiency. The ruling was criticized by Republican Senator Ben Sasse, while health organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association praised the decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
