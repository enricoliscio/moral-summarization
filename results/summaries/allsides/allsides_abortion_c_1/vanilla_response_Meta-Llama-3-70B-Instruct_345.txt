SUMMARY:

A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the measure could be costly and damaging to emergency care. The rule would have broadened the list of healthcare personnel who can refuse to participate and restricted employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. Critics argued that the rule would be discriminatory and interfere with people's access to healthcare. The judge's decision was praised by healthcare organizations and advocates for women's and LGBTQ+ rights, but criticized by some Republicans. The ruling blocks the rule from taking effect on November 22.
