SUMMARY:

A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the rule exceeded the authority of the US Health and Human Services Department and was based on a false claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The rule would have broadened the list of healthcare personnel who can refuse to participate and restricted employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. Critics argued that the rule would be discriminatory and interfere with people's access to healthcare. The judge's ruling was praised by healthcare organizations and advocates, but condemned by some Republicans. The ruling blocks the rule from taking effect on November 22.
