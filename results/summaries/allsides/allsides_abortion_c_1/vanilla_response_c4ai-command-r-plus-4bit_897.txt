SUMMARY: On Wednesday, November 6th, a federal judge in New York struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed more healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The ruling stated that the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on false claims of increased complaints about workers being forced to act against their conscience. The ruling argued that the rule could be discriminatory, costly, and burdensome, particularly in emergency care situations, and that it exceeded existing laws protecting healthcare professionals' religious and moral beliefs. The rule also restricted employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections and broadened the definition of healthcare entities. The judge warned that it could force healthcare employers to increase staff, especially during emergencies, creating inefficiencies and dislocations. The ruling was praised by Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association but criticized by Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who urged the administration to appeal.
