SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and went beyond existing law in issuing the rule, which was based on "flatly untrue" claims of a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The rule was deemed "costly, burdensome, and damaging" to emergency care and would have interfered with people's access to healthcare, particularly for vulnerable populations such as women, LGBT people, and those with HIV or AIDS. The judge's decision blocked the rule from taking effect, preventing discrimination and ensuring that healthcare employers are not forced to accommodate religious objections that could jeopardize patient care. The ruling was hailed as a victory for healthcare access and a blow to discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
