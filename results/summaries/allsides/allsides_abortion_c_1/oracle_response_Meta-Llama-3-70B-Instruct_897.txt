SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds, citing that it was based on a "lie" and would be "costly", "burdensome", and "damaging" to emergency care. The judge ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had "overstepped" its authority and gone "beyond" existing law in issuing the rule. The measure was deemed "discriminatory" and would have "interfered" with people's access to health care. The ruling blocked the administration's attempt to provide "legal cover for discrimination". Health organizations and 19 states had sued to block the rule, arguing it would "jeopardize" the health of vulnerable populations. The judge's decision was praised by Planned Parenthood, but criticized by Sen. Ben Sasse, who called the ruling "absurd mush". END OF SUMMARY.
