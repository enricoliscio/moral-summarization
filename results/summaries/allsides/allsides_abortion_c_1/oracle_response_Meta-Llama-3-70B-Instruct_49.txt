SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and went beyond existing law in issuing the rule, which could have been costly, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care. The department's claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience was deemed "flatly untrue." The rule would have been discriminatory, interfering with people's access to healthcare, and could have jeopardized the health of vulnerable populations. The judge blocked the rule, preventing the Trump administration from providing legal cover for discrimination. The ruling was hailed as a victory by health organizations, while a Republican senator called it "absurd mush" and urged an appeal. END OF SUMMARY.
