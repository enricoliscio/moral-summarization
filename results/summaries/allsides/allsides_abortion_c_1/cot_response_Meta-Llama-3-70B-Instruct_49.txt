SUMMARY:
A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the measure could be costly, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care. The department's claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience was deemed "flatly untrue." The rule was criticized for being discriminatory and for potentially jeopardizing the health of vulnerable populations, including women, LGBT people, and people with HIV or AIDS. In contrast, a Republican senator called the ruling "absurd mush" and urged the Trump administration to appeal. The judge's decision blocks the rule from taking effect, protecting people's access to health care.
END OF SUMMARY.
