Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule related to health care workers refusing to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. 

The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority. He also criticized the rule as being based on false claims about an increase in complaints. The rule was set to take effect on November 22, but lawsuits from 19 states and others blocked it.

The HHS rule expanded the list of personnel who could refuse to participate, including counselors, trainers, etc. It also affected how employers could inquire about objections. The judge warned this could disrupt emergency care and force institutions to increase staffing, which would be costly.

Supporters, like Planned Parenthood, praised the ruling, while opponents, such as Sen. Ben Sasse, called it absurd. The existing Conscience Provisions from 1973 were already in place, and this rule was an expansion of those.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the judge's ruling, mention the criticism of HHS overstepping and lying, the impact on emergency care, and the reaction from both sides. I'll also note that the rule was blocked by lawsuits and the expansion beyond the existing provisions.

Let me make sure I include all key points: judge's decision, HHS overreach, false claims, impact on emergency care, reactions from supporters and opponents, and the expansion of the rule beyond existing laws.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main action (judge striking down the rule), then the reasoning, the consequences, and the reactions. Keeping it concise but informative.

I think that covers everything without going over the word limit. Let me put it all together.

SUMMARY: A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule allowing health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority and based the rule on false claims of increased complaints. The rule, which would have expanded the list of personnel who could refuse to participate, including counselors and trainers, was blocked by lawsuits from 19 states and health organizations. Critics argued it would disrupt emergency care and force institutions to increase staffing, while supporters like Planned Parenthood praised the ruling. Opponents, such as Sen. Ben Sasse, called it absurd. The judge emphasized that Congress, not HHS, should decide on such laws. END OF SUMMARY.
