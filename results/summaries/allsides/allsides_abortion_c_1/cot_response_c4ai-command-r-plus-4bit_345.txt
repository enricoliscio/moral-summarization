SUMMARY:
A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or *conscience* grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, stated that the rule was based on a *lie*, as there was no significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their *conscience*. The rule was also deemed *discriminatory*, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care. Opponents of the rule, including 19 states and health organizations, argued that it would interfere with people's access to health care and be particularly harmful to *vulnerable* populations. The ruling was criticized by Republican Senator Ben Sasse as "*absurd mush*," but it was praised by Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, who asserted that the Trump administration was blocked from providing legal cover for *discrimination*. Engelmayer highlighted the potential *inhibit* on employers' ability to organize their workplaces efficiently and the HHS's overreach in creating the rule, urging Congress to address the issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
