SUMMARY:

A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority and that the measure could be costly and damaging to emergency care. The rule would have broadened the list of healthcare personnel who can refuse to participate and restricted employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. Critics argued that the rule would be discriminatory and interfere with people's access to healthcare. The judge's ruling was praised by health organizations and advocacy groups, but a Republican senator called it "absurd mush" and urged the administration to appeal.

END OF SUMMARY.
