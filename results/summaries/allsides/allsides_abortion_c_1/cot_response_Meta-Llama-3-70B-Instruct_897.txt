SUMMARY:
A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the rule was based on a "flatly untrue" claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The rule was deemed "costly, burdensome, and damaging" to emergency care and would have led to "discrimination" against certain populations, including women, LGBT people, and people with HIV or AIDS. The judge argued that the rule was a "solution in search of a problem" and that the administration had "lied" about the need for it. The ruling was hailed as a victory for those who believe that health care workers should not be allowed to "discriminate" against patients based on their personal beliefs. END OF SUMMARY.
