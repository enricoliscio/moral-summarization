SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds, citing that it was "based on a lie" and "went beyond existing law". The judge argued that the rule was "costly, burdensome, and damaging" to emergency care and would have "jeopardized" the health of vulnerable populations. The rule was deemed "discriminatory" and would have "interfered" with people's access to healthcare. The judge also noted that the administration's claims about an increase in complaints were "flatly untrue". The ruling was hailed as a victory by healthcare organizations, who argued that the rule would have provided "legal cover for discrimination". On the other hand, a Republican senator called the ruling "absurd mush" and urged the administration to appeal. The judge's decision blocks the rule from taking effect, preventing healthcare employers from being forced to "inhibit" their ability to organize workplace arrangements. END OF SUMMARY.
