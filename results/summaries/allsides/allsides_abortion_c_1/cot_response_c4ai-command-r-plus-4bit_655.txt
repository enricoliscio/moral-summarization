SUMMARY:
A federal *judge* struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed health care workers to refuse to participate in procedures, including abortions, on *moral* or religious grounds. The *judge* found that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) overstepped its *authority* and that the rule was based on a lie. The HHS claimed there was an increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their *conscience*, but the *judge* deemed this "flatly *untrue*." The ruling blocks what was seen as a discriminatory policy that would have interfered with access to health care and could have *inhibit*ed the ability of employers to organize their workforce efficiently. The *judge* also warned that the rule could be costly and burdensome, particularly for emergency care, and that it went beyond existing law. The ruling was applauded by Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, but criticized by a Republican senator who called it "absurd mush."
END OF SUMMARY.
