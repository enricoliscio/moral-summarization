Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about a federal judge in New York striking down a Trump administration rule. The rule allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures based on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, said the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on false claims about increased complaints.

The rule was supposed to take effect on November 22, but several states, health organizations, and others sued to block it. They argued it would be discriminatory and interfere with access to healthcare. The judge agreed, saying the rule was a "solution in search of a problem" and could be costly and damaging, especially in emergencies.

The new rule expanded the list of healthcare personnel who could refuse participation, including counselors, trainers, and even receptionists or ambulance drivers. This could force employers to increase staff during emergencies, which the judge found problematic.

Supporters like Sen. Ben Sasse criticized the ruling, calling it absurd and urging an appeal. Opponents, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, welcomed the decision, stating it could harm vulnerable populations.

So, the main points are: the rule was struck down, the judge's reasoning about overstepping and false claims, the potential impact on healthcare access and costs, and the reaction from both sides.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the judge's decision, the rule's content, the judge's criticisms, the lawsuit details, the consequences of the rule, and the reactions from different groups. I'll make sure to include key details without getting too bogged down in specifics.

SUMMARY: A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse participation in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on false claims of increased complaints. The rule, set to take effect on November 22, was challenged by 19 states, health organizations, and others, who argued it would be discriminatory and hinder access to healthcare. The judge criticized the rule as a "solution in search of a problem," noting its potential to increase costs and disrupt emergency care. The rule expanded the categories of healthcare personnel who could refuse participation, including counselors and receptionists, which could force employers to hire more staff during emergencies. Supporters like Sen. Ben Sasse criticized the ruling, while opponents, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, welcomed the decision, citing risks to vulnerable populations.
