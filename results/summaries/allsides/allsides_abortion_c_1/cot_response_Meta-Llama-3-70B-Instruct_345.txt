SUMMARY:
A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the rule was based on a "flatly untrue" claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The rule was deemed "costly, burdensome, and damaging" to emergency care and would have led to "discrimination" against certain groups, including women, LGBT people, and those with HIV or AIDS. The judge argued that the rule was a "solution in search of a problem" and that the administration acted outside its authority. The ruling was hailed as a victory by healthcare organizations, but criticized by some Republicans as "absurd mush". The judge's decision protects the rights of patients to access healthcare without unjustified restrictions. END OF SUMMARY.
