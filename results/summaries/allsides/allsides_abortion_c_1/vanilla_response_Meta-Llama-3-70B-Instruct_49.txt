SUMMARY:

A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other medical procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) overstepped its authority and that the measure could be costly and damaging to emergency care. The rule would have broadened the list of healthcare personnel who can refuse to participate and restricted employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. The judge warned that the rule could force healthcare employers to double or triple staff, particularly during emergencies. Nineteen states, the District of Columbia, and health organizations had sued to block the rule, arguing it would be discriminatory and interfere with people's access to healthcare.

END OF SUMMARY.
