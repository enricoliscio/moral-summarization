SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that could have allowed more health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds, stating that the Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and went beyond existing law. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, also highlighted the potential costs and burdens of the rule, arguing that it could be damaging to emergency care and was based on false claims about an increase in conscience-based complaints. Nineteen states, health organizations, and other entities sued to block the rule, arguing that it would interfere with people's access to health care and discriminate against certain groups. The ruling prevents the Trump administration from providing legal cover for discrimination and highlights the importance of leaving such decisions to Congress.
END OF SUMMARY.
