SUMMARY:

A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the rule was based on a "lie" and would have been "costly, burdensome, and damaging" to emergency care. The rule would have expanded the list of healthcare personnel who could refuse to participate, including receptionists, elevator operators, and ambulance drivers, potentially forcing employers to double or triple staff during emergencies. The judge argued that the rule was a "solution in search of a problem" and that the administration had overstepped its authority. The ruling was praised by healthcare organizations and advocates for reproductive rights, who argued that the rule would have been discriminatory and interfered with people's access to healthcare. In contrast, a Republican senator called the ruling "absurd mush" and urged the administration to appeal.
