SUMMARY: A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule that would allow more healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures based on moral or religious grounds. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, stated that the rule was beyond the authority of the Health and Human Services Department and went beyond existing law. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by nineteen states, health organizations, and others who argued that the rule would be discriminatory and interfere with access to healthcare. The HHS rule broadens the definition of who can refuse to participate in certain procedures and restricts employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. Judge Engelmayer warned that the rule could be costly and burdensome and could impact emergency care. He also stated that the rationale for the rule was based on a lie, as there has not been a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The ruling was praised by Planned Parenthood and other health organizations.

END OF SUMMARY.
