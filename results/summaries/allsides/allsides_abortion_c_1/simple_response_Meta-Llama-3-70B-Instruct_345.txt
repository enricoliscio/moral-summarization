SUMMARY:

A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority and that the measure could be costly, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care. The rule was deemed a "solution in search of a problem" as there was no evidence of a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The ruling was hailed by pro-choice groups, who argued that the rule would have interfered with people's access to healthcare and would have been discriminatory. Critics of the ruling, including Sen. Ben Sasse, called it "absurd mush" and urged the Trump administration to appeal.

END OF SUMMARY.
