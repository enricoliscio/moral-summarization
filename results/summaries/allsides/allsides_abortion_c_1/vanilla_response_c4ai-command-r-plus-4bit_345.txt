SUMMARY: A federal judge has struck down a new Trump administration rule that would allow health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The rule was challenged by nineteen states, health organizations, and others who argued that it would interfere with people's access to healthcare and be discriminatory. The judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, stated that the rule was based on a lie and that the Health and Human Services Department had overstepped its authority. He also warned that the rule could be costly and burdensome, particularly for emergency care, and could force health care employers to increase staff. The rule would have broadened the list of health care personnel who can refuse to participate in certain procedures and restricted employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. Opponents of the rule, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, praised the judge's decision, while supporters, such as Republican Senator Ben Sasse, criticized it.
