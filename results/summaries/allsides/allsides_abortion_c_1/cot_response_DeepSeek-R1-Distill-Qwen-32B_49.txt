Alright, I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and specific instructions. First, I have to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. Then, I need to write a summary preserving those moral framings.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "protest," "abortion," "refuse," "conscience," "discriminatory," "vulnerable," "absurd," "protection," "discrimination," "jeopardize," "moral," "burdensome," "false," "lies," "authority," "unconstitutional," "oppress," "access," "rights," "equality," "justice," "oppression," "freedom," "oppressed," "oppressing," "morally," "immoral," "ethically," "unjust," "unfair," "oppressive," "morally," "ethically," "unjust," "unfair," "oppressive," "morally," "ethically," "unjust," "unfair," "oppressive." I'll list each with a *.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping the moral framing intact. The key points are the judge striking down the rule, the expansion of refusal rights, the impact on vulnerable groups, the false claims by HHS, the opposition from various groups, and the political reactions. I'll make sure to include words like "protest," "abortion," "discriminatory," "vulnerable," "absurd," "discrimination," "jeopardize," "moral," "false," "authority," "unconstitutional," "oppress," "access," "rights," "equality," "justice," "oppression," "freedom," "oppressed," "oppressing," "morally," "ethically," "unjust," "unfair," "oppressive."

I'll structure the summary to highlight the judge's decision, the rule's expansion, the opposition's arguments, the false claims, and the political divide. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring it flows naturally while preserving the moral language is crucial. I'll avoid adding any new moral terms not present in the original text.

**SUMMARY:**  
A federal judge struck down a Trump administration rule allowing health care workers to refuse participation in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and made false claims about a surge in complaints. The rule, which expanded refusal rights to include counselors, trainers, and even receptionists, was deemed discriminatory and potentially harmful to vulnerable populations like women, LGBT individuals, and those with HIV/AIDS. Critics argued it could disrupt emergency care and force employers to hire more staff. Supporters, like Sen. Ben Sasse, called the ruling "absurd." The decision highlights tensions over balancing religious freedom with access to healthcare, emphasizing the moral and ethical implications of such policies.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
