SUMMARY:

A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the rule was unlawful and could be costly, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care. The rule, which was set to take effect on November 22, would have expanded the list of healthcare personnel who can refuse to participate and restricted employers' ability to inquire about employees' objections. Nineteen states, the District of Columbia, and health organizations had sued to block the rule, arguing it would be discriminatory and interfere with people's access to healthcare. The judge's ruling was praised by Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, but criticized by a Nebraska Republican senator who urged the Trump administration to appeal.
