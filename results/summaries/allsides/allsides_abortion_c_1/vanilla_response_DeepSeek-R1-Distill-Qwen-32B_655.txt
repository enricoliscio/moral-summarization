Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about a federal judge striking down a Trump administration rule related to healthcare workers refusing to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. 

The key points are: the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, ruled that the HHS overstepped its authority. He also criticized the rule as costly and based on false claims about increased complaints. The rule was set to take effect on Nov. 22 but was blocked. The plaintiffs included 19 states, DC, local governments, and health organizations. They argued it was discriminatory and would hinder access to healthcare. 

Planned Parenthood and the APA were against it, while Sen. Ben Sasse supported the administration's appeal. The rule expanded the types of healthcare workers who could refuse participation, potentially affecting even support staff like receptionists or ambulance drivers. The judge noted this could disrupt emergency care and increase staffing costs. He also mentioned that HHS shouldn't have the authority to cut funding for non-compliance; that's a legislative matter.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the judge struck down the rule, mention the criticisms, who was involved in the lawsuit, the implications of the rule, and the judge's reasoning about HHS's overreach and funding authority. I'll make sure it's clear and concise, hitting all the main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: A federal judge in New York has struck down a Trump administration rule allowing healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions or other procedures on moral or religious grounds. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the rule was based on false claims of increased complaints. The rule, which would have expanded the types of healthcare personnel who could refuse participation, was blocked from taking effect on November 22. Plaintiffs, including 19 states, health organizations, and local governments, argued it would be discriminatory and hinder access to healthcare. Critics, including Planned Parenthood and the American Psychological Association, said it could harm vulnerable populations. Supporters, like Sen. Ben Sasse, called the ruling "absurd" and urged an appeal. The judge also criticized the rule for potentially disrupting emergency care and increasing staffing costs. He noted that HHS lacked authority to cut funding for non-compliance, a decision reserved for Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
