SUMMARY:
A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed healthcare workers to refuse to participate in abortions and other procedures on moral or religious grounds. The judge ruled that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department overstepped its authority and that the measure could be costly, burdensome, and damaging to emergency care. The rule was based on a "flatly untrue" claim that there was a significant increase in complaints about workers being forced to violate their conscience. The judge argued that the rule could have "jeopardized the health of some of our most vulnerable populations, including women, LGBT people, and people with HIV or AIDS." The ruling was hailed as a victory by healthcare organizations and advocates, who argued that the rule would have provided "legal cover for discrimination." On the other hand, a Republican senator called the ruling "absurd mush" and urged the Trump administration to appeal. END OF SUMMARY.
