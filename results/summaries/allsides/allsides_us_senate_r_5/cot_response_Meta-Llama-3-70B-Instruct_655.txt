SUMMARY:
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror attacks, threatening to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and the Defense Department. Graham is seeking an "accountable" explanation of the president's leadership during the incident, criticizing the administration's handling of the attacks as "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled." The senator wants to know if the White House contacted the Libyan government to help the Americans under attack, and why no follow-up calls were made. Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, have called Graham's actions "unprecedented" and "not appropriate," arguing that dwelling on the tragedy to block nominations is not justified. END OF SUMMARY.
