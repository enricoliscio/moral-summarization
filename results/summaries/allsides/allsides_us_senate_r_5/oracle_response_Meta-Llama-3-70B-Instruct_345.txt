SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is determined to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham is critical of the White House's handling of the crisis, accusing them of "delayed, denied, deceived and stonewalled" information. He wants to know if the president pressed the Libyan government to let a response team reach the U.S. outpost under attack. Graham's actions are seen as "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes it's "not appropriate" to dwell on the tragedy to block nominations. Graham is willing to take drastic measures, including holding up the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA director, until the White House provides a full accounting of the events of that night.
