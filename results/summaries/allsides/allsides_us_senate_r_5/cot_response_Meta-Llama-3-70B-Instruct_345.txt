SUMMARY:
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror attacks before confirming President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham is holding the administration "accountable" for their leadership during the incident, citing a lack of transparency and accusing them of "delayed, denied, deceived and stonewalled" responses. He wants to know what the president and other top officials did during the eight-hour attack, including whether they called the Libyan government for help. Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, have called Graham's actions "unprecedented" and "not appropriate," but Graham is determined to get answers before confirming nominees Chuck Hagel and John Brennan. END OF SUMMARY.
