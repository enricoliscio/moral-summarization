Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham and his stance on the nominations for CIA and Defense Department. He's a Republican from South Carolina and is critical of Chuck Hagel and the White House's handling of the Benghazi attacks. The attacks happened in 2012 and resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three others. 

Graham wants more details about what the White House did that night before confirming Hagel as Defense Secretary. He's also applying the same tactic to John Brennan's nomination for CIA director. He's not threatening a filibuster but has been taking other steps, like demanding Leon Panetta testify. Another senator, James Inhofe, threatened a filibuster to require 60 votes for Hagel's confirmation. 

Hagel's nomination is opposed by many Republicans due to concerns about his support for Israel and military action against Iran. Graham is pushing for accountability from Obama, questioning his leadership during the attacks. Democrats, like Jack Reed, think Graham's actions are unprecedented and not appropriate.

So, the main points are: Graham's opposition to Hagel's nomination, his demand for more information about the White House's response during Benghazi, his tactics including delaying confirmation, and the Republican opposition to Hagel. Also, the Democrats' criticism of Graham's approach.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements. I'll start by mentioning Graham's suggestion to hold up the nominations, his reasons related to Benghazi, the specific questions about the White House's actions, and his approach with both nominees. Then, I'll note the Republican opposition and the Democrats' criticism. I should also include Inhofe's threat of a filibuster as part of the Republican strategy.

I should structure it in a way that flows logically, starting with Graham's actions, the reasons behind them, the implications for the nominations, and the opposing views from Democrats. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is important. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail.
