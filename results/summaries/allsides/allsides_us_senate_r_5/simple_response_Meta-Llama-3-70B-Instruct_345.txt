SUMMARY:

Senator Lindsey Graham is taking a strong stance against the White House, demanding more information about the administration's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks before confirming President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham is critical of the handling of the attacks, which killed four Americans, and wants to know what the President and top officials were doing that night. He is particularly concerned about why no follow-up calls were made after the initial 30-minute conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham's actions have been called "unprecedented" by Democratic Senator Jack Reed, who believes it's not appropriate to dwell on the tragedy to block nominations. However, Graham remains resolute, saying "no confirmation without information" and that the President must be held accountable for his leadership during the incident. END OF SUMMARY.
