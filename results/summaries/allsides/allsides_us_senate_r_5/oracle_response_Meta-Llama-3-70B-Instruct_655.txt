SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, before allowing the confirmation of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and the Defense Department. Graham is critical of the White House's handling of the crisis and wants to know what the president and other top administration officials did during the attack. He questions why no follow-up calls were made after a 30-minute phone conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham accuses the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" and demands accountability from Obama for his leadership during the incident. Democrats, however, support the president's nominations and call Graham's actions "unprecedented" and "not appropriate."
