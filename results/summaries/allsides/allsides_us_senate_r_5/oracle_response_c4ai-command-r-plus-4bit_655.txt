SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina threatens to delay President Obama's nominees to lead the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham accuses the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" behavior and demands an accounting of the president's actions during the night of the attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham questions the White House's response and leadership during the crisis, asking if they contacted the Libyan government for help and pressed them to allow a response team to assist the outpost under attack. He vows to block the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director until his demands are met. Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe also threatens to filibuster Hagel's nomination. Democrats support the president's choices, but Republicans express concerns about Hagel's stance on Israel and Iran's nuclear program. Graham insists on accountability from the president, demanding answers to his questions about the White House's actions during the Benghazi tragedy. Rhode Island Democratic Senator Jack Reed calls Graham's actions "unprecedented" and inappropriate.
END OF SUMMARY.
