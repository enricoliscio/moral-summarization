Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Sen. Lindsey Graham delaying Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense until more info on Benghazi attacks. He's critical of the administration's response and wants accountability.

I should identify the key elements: the senators involved, the nominees, the Benghazi attacks, the deaths, and the moral words like "attacks," "killed," "accounting," etc.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally. I'll start by mentioning Graham's suggestion to hold up the nominations. Then, explain his reasons, including the moral framing words. I'll also include the opposition from Democrats and other Republicans' actions.

I should make sure each sentence includes relevant moral terms without forcing them. For example, using "attacks," "killed," "accounting," "help," "accountable," etc., where appropriate.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to cover all main points concisely, ensuring it's clear and sticks to the moral framing as per the author's intent.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides a full accounting of its response during the Benghazi attacks. The attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, have become a focal point for criticism of the administration’s handling of the crisis. Graham emphasized the need for accountability, questioning whether the White House made efforts to help the victims by contacting the Libyan government. He accused the administration of delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling, insisting that Obama must account for his leadership during the tragedy. Graham also threatened to withhold confirmation for CIA nominee John Brennan until more details are revealed. Other Republicans, like Sen. James Inhofe, have threatened to filibuster Hagel’s nomination, requiring a supermajority vote. Democrats, however, support Hagel, while Republicans remain divided over concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran. The ongoing focus on Benghazi has drawn criticism from some Democrats, who argue that Graham’s actions are unprecedented and inappropriate. END OF SUMMARY.
