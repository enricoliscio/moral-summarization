Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They've also listed specific morally charged words that the author used. My task is to create a concise summary, under 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's about Senator Lindsey Graham delaying the confirmation of Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Secretary until more information is provided about the Benghazi attacks. The attacks killed several Americans, and Graham is critical of the White House's response.

I should identify the key elements: the senators involved, their actions, the moral words used, and the implications. I need to ensure that the summary includes words like "attacks," "killed," "accounting," "help," "accountable," "incident," "delayed," "denied," "deceived," "stonewalled," "pressed," "crisis," and "tragedy."

I should structure the summary to highlight Graham's stance, his use of these moral terms, and the reactions from other senators. I need to keep it clear and within the word limit, making sure each sentence adds value without unnecessary details.

Also, I should maintain the moral framing by using the specified words to convey the criticism and the urgency of the situation. It's important to show that Graham is holding the administration accountable and that the issue is seen as a tragedy with a crisis-level response needed.

I'll start by mentioning Graham's suggestion to delay the nominations. Then, I'll include the moral words to describe the attacks and the need for an accounting. Next, I'll outline his actions, like calling for accountability and the specific questions about phone calls and the Libyan government's involvement. I should also mention the criticism from Democrats, such as Senator Reed, to provide a balanced view.

Finally, I'll conclude by tying it back to the larger context of the Benghazi tragedy and the ongoing debate over the administration's handling of the crisis. This should encapsulate the moral framing effectively while staying within the required length.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has suggested delaying the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for CIA and Defense Secretary until the White House provides more details about its response to the Benghazi attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham emphasized the need for an "accounting" of the White House’s actions during the incident, questioning whether the administration "pressed" the Libyan government to assist. He accused the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and demanded accountability for Obama’s leadership during the national crisis. Graham also threatened to withhold confirmation for CIA nominee John Brennan until more information is provided, stating, "No confirmation without information." Meanwhile, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe threatened to filibuster Hagel’s nomination, while Democrats criticized Graham’s tactics as "unprecedented" and inappropriate, calling his focus on the tragedy to block nominations "not appropriate." The ongoing debate highlights the moral and political stakes surrounding the Benghazi tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
