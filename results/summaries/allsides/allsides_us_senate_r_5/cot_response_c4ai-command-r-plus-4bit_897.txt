SUMMARY:
Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to block the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department Chief until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham accuses the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and demands to know the president's actions during the night of the attacks. He questions whether the president attempted to contact the Libyan government for help and if he pressed them to allow a response team to leave the airport. Graham's actions are deemed "aggressive" and "unprecedented" by some, while others criticize his use of the tragedy to block nominations as "inappropriate.". Graham has also called on the president to withdraw the nomination of Chuck Hagel, who faces opposition from Republicans over concerns about his support for Israel and Iran. The Senator vows to hold Obama "accountable" for his leadership during the Benghazi incident, demanding answers for the lack of follow-up calls after the initial conversation.
