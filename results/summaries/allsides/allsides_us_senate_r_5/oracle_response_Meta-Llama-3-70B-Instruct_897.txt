SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has threatened to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham demands to know if the White House contacted the Libyan government to help the victims, and why no follow-up calls were made after the initial 30-minute conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham accuses the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" information, and vows to hold Obama "accountable" for his leadership during the crisis. Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, call Graham's actions "unprecedented" and "not appropriate," but Graham remains resolute in his pursuit of truth, saying "no confirmation without information." END OF SUMMARY.
