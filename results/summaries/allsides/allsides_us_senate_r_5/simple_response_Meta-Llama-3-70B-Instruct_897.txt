SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is threatening to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more information about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is seeking accountability from the president and wants to know why no follow-up calls were made after the initial 30-minute phone conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on the day of the attacks. Graham's actions have been deemed "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes that dwelling on the tragedy to block nominations is "not appropriate." Graham's moral framing of the issue is one of accountability and transparency, arguing that the White House has "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" and that the president must be held accountable for his leadership during the incident.
