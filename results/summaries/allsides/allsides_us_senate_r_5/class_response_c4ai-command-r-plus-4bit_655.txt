SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to block President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department chief unless the White House provides more details about the Benghazi incident. Graham accuses the administration of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and demands accountability for the night of the attacks that killed Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans. He questions the White House's actions during the crisis, including whether they called the Libyan government for help and pressed them to allow a response team to assist. Graham pledges to hold up the nominations of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan until he receives an accounting of the President's leadership during the tragedy. Senator Jack Reed calls Graham's actions "unprecedented" and inappropriate. Graham vows to continue seeking the truth about the administration's response to the Benghazi attack.
END OF SUMMARY.
