Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I have to include as many as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Sen. Lindsey Graham is holding up Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense until more info on Benghazi. He's critical of the administration's response to the attacks, which killed Ambassador Stevens and others. He uses terms like "attacks," "killed," "accounting," "help," "accountable," etc. 

I should structure the summary to include these terms. Start with Graham's actions, mention the nominees, the request for details, and the moral implications. Also, include other senators' reactions, like Inhofe's filibuster threat and Reed's criticism. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and includes the key morally framed words without making it sound forced. Maybe start with Graham's demand, then his methods, other senators' actions, and conclude with the ongoing debate and the moral issues involved.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence includes the necessary moral terms and stays within the word count.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has demanded that President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Secretary not be confirmed until the administration provides a detailed account of its actions during the Benghazi attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. Graham emphasized the need for "accountability" and questioned whether the White House "pressed" the Libyan government for help during the crisis. He accused the administration of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" in providing information. Graham also threatened to block the confirmation of John Brennan for the CIA, insisting on "no confirmation without information." Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe threatened a filibuster to require Hagel to secure 60 votes, while Democrats defended the nomination. Graham's focus on the tragedy to delay confirmations has been called "unprecedented" and "not appropriate" by Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed. The ongoing debate highlights concerns about the administration's handling of the national crisis and its accountability for the incident. END OF SUMMARY.
