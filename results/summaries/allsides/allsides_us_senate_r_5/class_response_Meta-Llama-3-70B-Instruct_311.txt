SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding an "accounting" from the White House regarding the Benghazi terror attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham wants to know what President Obama and top administration officials were doing the night of the attacks and is threatening to hold up the appointments of CIA and Defense Department nominees until he gets answers. He questions why the White House didn't "press" the Libyan government to let a response team reach the U.S. outpost under attack for eight hours. Graham accuses the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" information, and vows to hold Obama "accountable" for his leadership during the "incident". Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, call Graham's actions "unprecedented" and "not appropriate", saying he's using the "tragedy" to block nominations. Graham remains resolute, insisting on transparency and answers about the "crisis" night. END OF SUMMARY.
