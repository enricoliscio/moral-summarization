Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham's actions regarding the nominations of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan, linking them to the Benghazi attacks. 

He's suggesting holding up their confirmations until the White House provides more details about what happened that night. The moral framing here seems to be about accountability and transparency. Words like "hold up," "accounting," "deceive," "stonewalled" are used, which carry moral implications.

I should identify all the morally framed words first. Let me go through the article again. Words like "hold up," "accounting," "deceive," "stonewalled," "unprecedented," "inappropriate," "accountable," "crisis," "delayed," "denied," "deceive," "stonewalled," "end," "account," "leadership,"
