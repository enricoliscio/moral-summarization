Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the words used.

The article is about Sen. Lindsey Graham holding up Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until more info on Benghazi attacks. The attacks killed Ambassador Stevens and others. Graham wants accountability, using words like "attacks," "killed," "allow," "stop," "producing," "delayed," "denied," "deceived," "stonewalled," "leadership," "crisis." 

He's delaying the confirmation of Hagel and Brennan, saying "No confirmation without information." He's criticized the White House's response, questioning if they called Libyan government for help. He's also pushing for 60 votes instead of 51, which is a higher bar. Democrats support Hagel, but Republicans oppose due to concerns about Israel and Iran. Graham accuses the White House of being uncooperative and hiding info, calling it a national crisis.

I need to include as many of those moral words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the tokens. I should structure it to show Graham's actions, the reasons, and the reactions from others, using the specified terms.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides details on the administration's response during the Benghazi attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. Graham has criticized the White House for "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and insists on accountability for the president's leadership during the national crisis. He has also threatened to block the nomination of Chuck Hagel for Defense Secretary unless the administration answers questions about the White House's actions that night, including whether the president pressed the Libyan government for assistance. Graham's actions have been labeled "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who criticized the focus on blocking nominations as "not appropriate." Meanwhile, Sen. James Inhofe has threatened to filibuster Hagel's nomination, requiring 60 votes for confirmation. END OF SUMMARY.
