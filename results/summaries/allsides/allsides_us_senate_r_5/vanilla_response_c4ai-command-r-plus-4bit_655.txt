SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to hold up appointments of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is critical of the Defense Department nominee, Chuck Hagel, and the White House's handling of the attacks that killed four Americans. Graham demands an accounting of the president's actions during the night of the attacks and questions if the White House contacted the Libyan government for help. He also wants to know if the president pressed Libya to allow a response team to leave the airport. Graham vows to hold Obama accountable for his leadership during the incident. Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe threatens to filibuster the Hagel nomination. Democrats support Hagel, but Republicans are concerned about his support for Israel and his stance on Iran. Rhode Island Democratic Senator Jack Reed calls Graham's actions "unprecedented" and inappropriate.
