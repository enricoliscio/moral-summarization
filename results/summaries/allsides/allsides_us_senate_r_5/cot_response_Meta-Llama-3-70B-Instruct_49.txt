SUMMARY:
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror attacks before confirming President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham is holding the nominees "accountable" for the administration's handling of the attacks, which killed four Americans. He claims the White House has "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" in providing details about the president's actions during the crisis. Graham wants to know if the president called the Libyan government to help the Americans under attack and why no follow-up calls were made after the initial 30-minute conversation. Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, have criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and "not appropriate," saying it's unfair to block nominations over the Benghazi issue. END OF SUMMARY.
