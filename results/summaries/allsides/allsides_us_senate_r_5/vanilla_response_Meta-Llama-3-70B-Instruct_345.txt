SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has threatened to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more information about the president's actions on the night of the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is critical of the handling of the attacks, which killed four Americans, and wants to know if the White House contacted the Libyan government to help the victims. He also wants to know what President Obama did during the eight-hour attack. Graham has already successfully demanded that outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testify on Benghazi before a vote on nominee Chuck Hagel. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe has also threatened to filibuster the Hagel nomination. Democrats support the nomination, but Republicans are largely opposed, citing concerns about Hagel's support for Israel and his stance on military action against Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
