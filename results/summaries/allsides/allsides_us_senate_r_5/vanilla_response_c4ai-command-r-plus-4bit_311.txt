SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham stated that he will try to delay the appointment of President Obama's nominees to lead the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more information about the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is among the most vocal critics of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel and the administration's handling of the attacks that killed four Americans. Graham is demanding details about the White House's response during the night of the attacks, including whether the president contacted the Libyan government for assistance. He also questioned why there were no follow-up calls after the initial conversation between Obama, Panetta, and Dempsey. Graham's efforts are supported by Republican Senator James Inhofe, who threatened to filibuster the Hagel nomination. Democrats support the president's nominations, but Republicans are largely opposed, citing concerns about Hagel's support for Israel and his stance on Iran. Graham has called for accountability from the president and vowed to block confirmations until his demands are met. Rhode Island Democratic Senator Jack Reed criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and inappropriate.
END OF SUMMARY.
