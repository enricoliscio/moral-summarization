SUMMARY: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is holding President Obama's nominees for Defense and CIA hostage. He is demanding that the White House provide more details about the actions of the President and other officials during the Benghazi terror attacks before he will approve the nominations. Graham is threatening to delay the confirmations of Chuck Hagel for Defense and John Brennan for CIA until his demands are met. He is using aggressive tactics to get his way, including calling for the President to withdraw the nomination and demanding testimony from the outgoing Defense Secretary. Graham is not alone in his opposition to Hagel, as many Republicans are concerned about Hagel's support for Israel and his stance on Iran. Graham is particularly critical of the White House's handling of the Benghazi attacks and is demanding more information about the President's leadership during the incident. He wants to know if the President contacted the Libyan government for help and if he pressed them to allow a response team to leave the airport. Democratic Senator Jack Reed criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and inappropriate, given that they are using a national tragedy for political gain. Graham remains steadfast in his demand for accountability from the President.
