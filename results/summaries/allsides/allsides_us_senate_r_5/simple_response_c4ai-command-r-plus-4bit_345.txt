SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham vows to hold up President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department, demanding more details about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham accuses the White House of stonewalling and demands accountability for the administration's response to the tragedy that killed four Americans. He questions the lack of follow-up calls and the president's efforts to secure help from the Libyan government. Graham's actions are criticized by Democratic Senator Jack Reed as "unprecedented" and "inappropriate." Republican Senator James Inhofe threatens to filibuster the nomination of Chuck Hagel for Defense Secretary, citing concerns over Israel and Iran. Graham's aggressive stance on Benghazi is part of a broader Republican opposition to Hagel's nomination. Graham seeks to ensure Obama's accountability for his leadership during the crisis.
