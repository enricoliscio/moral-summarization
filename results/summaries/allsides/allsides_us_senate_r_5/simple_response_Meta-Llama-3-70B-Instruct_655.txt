SUMMARY:

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about President Obama's actions on the night of the Benghazi terror attacks before confirming the President's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham is critical of the administration's handling of the attacks, which killed four Americans, and wants to know if the President or other officials contacted the Libyan government for help. He has threatened to hold up the nominations of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan until he gets the answers he's looking for. Graham's actions have been called "unprecedented" by Democratic Senator Jack Reed, who believes it's "not appropriate" to use the tragedy to block nominations. Graham's move is seen as a way to hold the President accountable for his leadership during the crisis.

END OF SUMMARY.
