SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has threatened to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more information about the president's actions on the night of the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham wants to know if the White House contacted the Libyan government to help the Americans under attack and why there were no follow-up calls after the initial phone conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham has been critical of the administration's handling of the attacks, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. He has also been opposed to the nomination of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary, citing concerns about Hagel's support for Israel and his stance on Iran's nuclear program. Democrats have criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and "not appropriate."

END OF SUMMARY.
