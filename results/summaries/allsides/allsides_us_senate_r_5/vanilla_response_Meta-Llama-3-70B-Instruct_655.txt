SUMMARY:

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatened to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department heads until the White House provides more information about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham wants to know if the White House contacted the Libyan government to help the Americans under attack and why no follow-up calls were made after the initial 30-minute conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham has been critical of the administration's handling of the attacks and has already called for the withdrawal of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel. Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe also threatened to filibuster Hagel's nomination. Democrats support the nominees, but Republicans are largely opposed, citing concerns over Hagel's support for Israel and his stance on military action against Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
