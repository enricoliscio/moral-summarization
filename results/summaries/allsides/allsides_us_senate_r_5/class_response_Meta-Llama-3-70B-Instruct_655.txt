SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding an "accounting" from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror "attacks" that "killed" Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham wants to know if the White House "help" was offered to the Libyan government to aid the U.S. outpost under "attack" for eight hours. He is threatening to hold up the nomination of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director until he gets answers. Graham accuses the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" information, and wants to know what President Obama did during the "incident" and "national crisis". Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, call Graham's actions "unprecedented" and "not appropriate", saying he is using the "tragedy" to block nominations. Graham insists on transparency, saying "no confirmation without information". END OF SUMMARY.
