SUMMARY: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham vows to hold up President Obama's nominees for key posts until the White House provides a full accounting of the president's actions during the Benghazi attack. Graham is among the most vocal critics of the administration's handling of the Benghazi incident, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. He questions the lack of follow-up calls and the absence of a response team, demanding to know if the president contacted the Libyan government for assistance. Graham's actions are deemed "unprecedented" and "inappropriate" by Rhode Island Democratic Senator Jack Reed, who believes Graham is using the tragedy to block nominations. Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe threatens a filibuster against Defense nominee Chuck Hagel, who faces opposition from Republicans over his stance on Israel and Iran. Graham insists on accountability from the president and demands answers to crucial questions about the White House's response to the attack.
END OF SUMMARY.
