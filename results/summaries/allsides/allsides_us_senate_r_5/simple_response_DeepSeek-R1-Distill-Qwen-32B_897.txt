Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham holding up President Obama's nominations for CIA and Defense Department until more information is provided about the Benghazi attacks. He's critical of Chuck Hagel and the White House's handling of the situation. The attacks killed Ambassador Stevens and others. Graham wants accountability and more details about the White House's actions that night. He's using the confirmation hearings as leverage, saying no confirmation without information. Other Republicans, like Sen. Inhofe, are considering filibusters. Democrats support Hagel, but Republicans oppose him over concerns about Israel and Iran. Graham is pushing for answers, accusing the White House of delaying and deceiving. Another Democrat, Sen. Reed, calls Graham's actions unprecedented and inappropriate.

So, the moral framing here seems to be about accountability and transparency. Graham is emphasizing the need for the White House to be transparent about their actions during a national crisis. The opposition is framing this as an unprecedented move that's not appropriate, possibly suggesting it's political rather than about the facts.

I need to make sure the summary captures this tension between accountability and the criticism of the approach. It should mention the key points: Graham's demand for information, the specific issues like phone calls to Libya, the filibuster threat, Republican opposition reasons, and the criticism from Democrats.

I should structure it to first state Graham's actions, then the reasons behind them, the reactions from other Republicans and Democrats, and the underlying moral issues of accountability versus political gamesmanship.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all essential elements. I'll start by stating Graham's plan to delay nominations, mention the Benghazi attacks, his demand for accountability, the specific questions about phone calls, the filibuster threat, Republican opposition reasons, and the Democratic criticism.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without getting too detailed. I'll also highlight the moral aspect by emphasizing the call for transparency and accountability versus the criticism of using the situation for political leverage.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure to include all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the administration's response during the Benghazi attacks. Graham, a vocal critic of the administration's handling of the incident, has emphasized the need for accountability and transparency, questioning whether the White House contacted Libyan authorities for assistance. He has also threatened to block the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director, stating, "No confirmation without information." Other Republicans, like Sen. James Inhofe, have threatened filibusters to require a supermajority vote for Hagel's confirmation. Democrats, however, argue that Graham's actions are unprecedented and inappropriate, with Sen. Jack Reed calling them a misuse of the confirmation process. The Republican opposition to Hagel stems from concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran. Graham's push for answers highlights the ongoing debate over transparency and accountability in the administration's handling of the Benghazi tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
