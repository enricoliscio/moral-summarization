SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina suggested he would attempt to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department, Chuck Hagel and John Brennan, respectively. Graham seeks more information about the White House's response to the Benghazi terror attacks on September 11, 2012, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Graham questions the lack of follow-up calls from the President and the absence of a response team from Tripoli. He demands an "accounting" of the President's actions during the eight-hour attack. Senator Graham has not threatened a filibuster but has employed other tactics to delay the nomination process. Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe has threatened a filibuster, seeking 60 votes for Hagel's confirmation. Democrats support the President's nominations, while Republicans express concerns about Hagel's stance on Israel and Iran. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and inappropriate.
END OF SUMMARY.
