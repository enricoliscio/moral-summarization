SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has threatened to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is critical of the administration's handling of the attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. He wants to know if the White House called the Libyan government to help the victims and why no follow-up calls were made after the initial phone conversation with Obama. Graham accused the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" information, and demanded Obama to account for his leadership during the crisis. Graham's actions have been called "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes it's "not appropriate" to dwell on the tragedy to block nominations. The confirmation of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan is at stake, with Republicans largely opposed to Hagel's nomination over concerns about his support for Israel and stance on Iran's nuclear program.

END OF SUMMARY.
