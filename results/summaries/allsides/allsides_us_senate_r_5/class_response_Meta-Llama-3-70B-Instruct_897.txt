SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding accountability from the White House regarding the Benghazi terror attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham is threatening to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the president's actions on the night of the attacks. He wants to know if the White House ever contacted the Libyan government to help the victims and why no follow-up calls were made after the initial 30-minute conversation. Graham accuses the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" information, and he vows to hold Obama "accountable" for his leadership during the incident. Democrats, however, consider Graham's actions "unprecedented" and "not appropriate," as they dwell on the tragedy to block nominations. The controversy surrounds the nominations of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan, with Republicans largely opposed to Hagel's support of Israel and stance on Iran's nuclear weapon production.

END OF SUMMARY.
