SUMMARY:
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham vows to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and the Defense Department until the White House provides more details about its response to the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham, who has been highly critical of the White House's handling of the issue, demands an "accounting" of the president's actions during the night of the attacks. He questions whether the White House made any attempts to seek help from the Libyan government and if there was any follow-up communication between the president and military leaders. Graham threatens to block the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director until his demands are met. He believes that the White House has "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" and that the president must be held "accountable" for his leadership during the tragic incident. Senator Jack Reed calls Graham's actions "unprecedented and inappropriate," deeming it a tragedy.
