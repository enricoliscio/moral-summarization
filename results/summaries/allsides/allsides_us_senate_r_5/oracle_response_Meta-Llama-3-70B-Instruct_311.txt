SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, before confirming President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham is critical of the administration's handling of the attacks and wants to know what the president and top officials were doing during the crisis. He questions why no follow-up calls were made after a 30-minute phone conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham accuses the White House of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" and wants Obama to account for his leadership during the incident. Graham's actions are seen as "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes it's "not appropriate" to dwell on the tragedy to block nominations. END OF SUMMARY.
