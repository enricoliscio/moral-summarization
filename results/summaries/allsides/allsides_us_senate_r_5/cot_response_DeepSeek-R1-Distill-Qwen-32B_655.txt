Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding what the article is about. It's about Senator Lindsey Graham trying to delay the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director until the White House provides more details about their actions during the Benghazi attacks. 

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. Looking through the article, words like "hold up," "accounting," "help," "No confirmation without information," "aggressive," "opposed," "support," "back," "accountable," "delayed," "denied," "deceived," "stonewalled," "unprecedented," "not appropriate" stand out. These words carry moral weight, indicating blame, responsibility, or criticism.

Next, I'll summarize the article. I'll start by mentioning Graham's actions to delay confirmations. Then, I'll explain his reasons, like wanting accountability and more details about the White House's response. I'll include his criticism of the administration's handling and mention other senators' reactions, like Inhofe's filibuster threat and Reed's criticism of Graham's tactics. I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the essence of the political conflict and the moral accusations involved.

**SUMMARY:**
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for Defense Secretary and CIA Director until the White House provides a full accounting of its response during the Benghazi attacks. Graham criticized the administration for failing to act decisively, questioning whether the White House contacted Libyan authorities for assistance. He emphasized, “No confirmation without information,” signaling his intent to hold Obama accountable for leadership during the crisis. While not threatening a filibuster, Graham has pushed for greater transparency, including Leon Panetta’s testimony. Fellow Republican Sen. James Inhofe threatened a filibuster to require 60 votes for Hagel’s confirmation. Democrats support Hagel, but Republicans oppose him over concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran. Graham accused the administration of delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling, calling for an end to such tactics. Democratic Sen. Jack Reed criticized Graham’s actions as unprecedented and inappropriate, arguing they politicize a tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
