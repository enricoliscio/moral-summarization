Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Sen. Lindsey Graham delaying the confirmation of Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until more details about the Benghazi attacks are provided. He's critical of the administration's handling of the situation where Ambassador Stevens and others were killed. The key points are Graham's actions, his use of morally charged language, and the political implications.

I need to make sure to include words like "attacks," "killed," "allow," "stop," "producing," "delayed," "denied," "deceived," "stonewalled," "leadership," "attack," and "crisis." I should structure the summary to highlight Graham's stance and the moral implications he's emphasizing.

Also, I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll start by stating Graham's suggestion, then mention the Benghazi attacks and the casualties. Next, I'll outline his demands and the moral framing words he uses. I'll also include the political moves he's making, like holding up confirmations and the threat of filibuster. Finally, I'll note the criticism from Democrats and the ongoing debate.

I should ensure that each morally framed word is appropriately placed to maintain the author's original tone. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides a detailed account of its actions during the Benghazi attacks. The attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, have become a focal point for criticism of the administration’s handling of the crisis. Graham emphasized the need for accountability, stating, “No confirmation without information,” and questioned whether the White House made efforts to contact the Libyan government for assistance. He accused the administration of “delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling” in providing answers about the president’s leadership during the attacks. Graham also raised concerns about whether Obama pressed Libya to allow a response team to reach the outpost under attack. Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, criticized Graham’s approach as “unprecedented” and inappropriate, while Republicans like Sen. James Inhofe threatened to filibuster Hagel’s nomination. The debate highlights ongoing tensions over transparency and leadership during a national crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
