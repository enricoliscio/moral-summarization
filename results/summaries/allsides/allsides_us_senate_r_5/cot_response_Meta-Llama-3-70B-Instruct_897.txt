SUMMARY:
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror attacks before confirming President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham wants to hold the nominees, Chuck Hagel and John Brennan, accountable for the administration's handling of the attacks. He claims the White House has "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" in providing details about the president's actions during the crisis. Graham's actions have been deemed "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes it's "not appropriate" to dwell on the tragedy to block nominations. Graham is seeking answers to questions such as whether the president pressed the Libyan government to allow a response team to reach the U.S. outpost under attack. END OF SUMMARY.
