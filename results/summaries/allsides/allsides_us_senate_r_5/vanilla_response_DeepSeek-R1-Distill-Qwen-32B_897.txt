Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Senator Lindsey Graham and the confirmation of Chuck Hagel. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator, wants to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about their actions during the Benghazi attacks. The attacks happened on September 11, 2012, and resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three others. Graham is critical of Chuck Hagel, the nominee for Defense Secretary, and the White House's handling of the situation.

Graham mentioned on CBS that he doesn't think Hagel should be confirmed without an accounting from the White House. He's also considering holding up John Brennan's nomination for CIA director. He hasn't threatened a filibuster but has been pushing for more information, like getting Leon Panetta to testify before the vote on Hagel.

Another Republican, James Inhofe, threatened a filibuster to require 60 votes for Hagel's confirmation. Democrats support the nomination, but Republicans are against it, mainly due to concerns about Hagel's stance on Israel and Iran's nuclear program.

Graham has been pushing for details about the White House's response that night, questioning why there were no follow-up calls and whether the president urged the Libyan government to help. He accuses the White House of delaying, denying, and deceiving. A Democratic senator, Jack Reed, called Graham's actions unprecedented and inappropriate.

So, the summary should include the main points: Graham's attempt to delay confirmations, the reason being the need for more information about the Benghazi attacks, the key issues like phone calls and Libya's response, other Republican actions like Inhofe's filibuster threat, and the Democratic response.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll structure it by mentioning Graham's actions, the context of Benghazi, the specific questions he's asking, other Republican moves, and the opposing Democratic viewpoint.

Let me draft that, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit. I'll start with the main action, then the reasons, followed by other related actions, and end with the opposing view.
