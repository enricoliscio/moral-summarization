SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has threatened to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more information about the president's actions on the night of the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham wants to know if the White House contacted the Libyan government to help the Americans under attack and why no follow-up calls were made after an initial 30-minute conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham's actions are seen as an attempt to hold the administration accountable for its handling of the crisis. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe has also threatened to filibuster the nomination of Chuck Hagel for Defense Secretary. Democrats have criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and "not appropriate," but Republicans are largely opposed to Hagel's nomination due to concerns about his support for Israel and stance on Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
