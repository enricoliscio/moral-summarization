Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham delaying the confirmation of Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until more information is provided about the Benghazi attacks.

First, I should identify the key points. Graham is a Republican senator from South Carolina who is critical of Chuck Hagel's nomination as Defense Secretary. He wants more details on what the White House did during the Benghazi attacks in 2012, which killed Ambassador Stevens and others. He's holding up the nominations, saying no confirmation without information. He's not threatening a filibuster but using other tactics like demanding testimony from Panetta.

Also, another senator, James Inhofe, threatened a filibuster for Hagel, needing 60 votes. Democrats support Hagel, but Republicans oppose him over issues with Israel and Iran. Graham has been pushing for accountability, questioning the White House's actions that night, like whether they contacted Libyan officials. He's critical of the administration's handling, calling it delaying and stonewalling.

Democratic Senator Jack Reed thinks Graham's actions are unprecedented and inappropriate. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include these main points: Graham's delay, the Benghazi incident, the nominees, the demand for information, Inhofe's threat, Republican opposition reasons, and Reed's criticism.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with Graham's action, the context of Benghazi, what he's demanding, the impact on nominations, other senators' actions, and the opposing views. Make sure it's all within the word limit and flows well.
