SUMMARY: Sen. Lindsey Graham vows to hold up appointments of President Obama’s nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about its response to the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham, a sharp critic of the administration’s handling of the issue, said he wants to know what the president and other top officials were doing during the night of the attacks, which killed four Americans. He accused the White House of “delaying, denying, deceiving and stonewalling” and demanded to know whether Obama pressed the Libyan government to allow a response team to leave a Libyan airport to help the Americans under attack. Graham’s actions have been criticized by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed as “unprecedented” and “not appropriate.”

Graham’s threat to block the nominations of Chuck Hagel for Defense Secretary and John Brennan for CIA director comes amid Republican opposition to Hagel’s nomination over concerns about his support for Israel and his stance on Iran. Graham has called for Obama to withdraw the nomination and has demanded that outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testify on Benghazi before a vote on Hagel. Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe has also threatened to filibuster the Hagel nomination.
