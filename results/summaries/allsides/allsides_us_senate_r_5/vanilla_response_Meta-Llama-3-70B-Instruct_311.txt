SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has threatened to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more information about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is critical of the administration's handling of the attacks and wants to know what the president and other officials did on the night of September 11, 2012. He has also called for more details about whether the White House contacted the Libyan government to help the Americans under attack. Graham's move is seen as an attempt to block the nomination of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director. Democrats have criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and "not appropriate". The nomination of Hagel is already facing opposition from Republicans over concerns about his support for Israel and stance on Iran.
