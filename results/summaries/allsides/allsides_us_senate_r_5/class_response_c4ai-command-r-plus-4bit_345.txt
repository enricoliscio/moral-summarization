SUMMARY: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to hold up President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about their response to the Benghazi terror attacks that killed four Americans. Graham accuses the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and demands that they be held "accountable" for their actions during this national crisis. He questions whether the president and other top officials took appropriate action on the night of the attacks, such as calling the Libyan government for help. Graham's efforts are seen as unprecedented and inappropriate by some, but he maintains that no confirmations should take place without the necessary information. Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe also threatens to filibuster the nomination of Chuck Hagel for Defense Secretary, citing concerns over Israel and Iran. Graham and other Republicans criticize Hagel's stance on these issues, but Graham's primary focus remains on seeking an accounting of the Benghazi tragedy. Graham vows to continue his efforts until the White House provides a full accounting of the incident.
