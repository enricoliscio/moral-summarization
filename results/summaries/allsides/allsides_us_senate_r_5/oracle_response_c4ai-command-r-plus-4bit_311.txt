SUMMARY: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is highly critical of the administration's handling of the attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. He questions the White House's actions during the night of the attacks, including whether they made any attempts to call the Libyan government for help. Graham vows to block the confirmation of Defense Department nominee Chuck Hagel and CIA nominee John Brennan until his demands are met. He accuses the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and calls for the president to be held "accountable" for his leadership during the crisis. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island criticizes Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and "inappropriate." Graham's threat comes amid Republican opposition to Hagel's nomination over concerns about his support for Israel and his stance on Iran's nuclear program.
