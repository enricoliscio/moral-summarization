SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about President Obama's actions on the night of the Benghazi terror attacks before confirming nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham is critical of the administration's handling of the attacks, which killed four Americans, and wants to know if the White House contacted the Libyan government for help. He is threatening to hold up the nominations of Chuck Hagel for Defense Secretary and John Brennan for CIA Director until he gets the information. Graham's actions are seen as unprecedented and inappropriate by Democrats, who support the president's nominees. The senator's demands are motivated by concerns about the administration's response to the crisis and its policies on Israel and Iran.

END OF SUMMARY.
