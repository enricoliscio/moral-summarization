SUMMARY: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to block President Obama's nominees for key positions until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham, known for his strong criticism of the administration's handling of the issue, demands an accounting of the president's actions during the night of the attacks. He questions the White House's response and whether enough was done to help the Americans under attack. Graham's aggressive tactics are unprecedented and have drawn criticism from Democrats like Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, who deems Graham's actions as inappropriate. Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe also threatens to filibuster the nomination of Chuck Hagel for Defense Secretary, citing concerns over Hagel's support for Israel and Iran's nuclear program. Graham vows to hold Obama accountable for his leadership during the Benghazi incident, demanding answers and transparency from the administration.
