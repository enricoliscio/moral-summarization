Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Senator Graham is delaying Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense until more information is provided about the Benghazi attacks. He's critical of the administration's handling of the incident, especially the night of the attacks. The article mentions the killed ambassador and other Americans, which are important for the moral framing.

I need to include words like "attacks," "killed," "accounting," "help," "accountable," "incident," "delayed," "denied," "deceived," "stonewalled," "pressed," "crisis," and "tragedy." I should structure the summary to show Graham's actions and the moral implications, like the delay in providing information and the criticism of the administration's handling.

I'll start by stating Graham's suggestion to hold up the nominations. Then, mention the Benghazi attacks and the deaths. Highlight his demand for an accounting and the specific questions about phone calls and assistance from Libya. Include his accusations of the administration's behavior, like delaying and deceiving. Also, note the Democratic response and the ongoing debate.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll make each sentence cover multiple points. I'll avoid any technical jargon and focus on the moral aspects, using the specified words to convey the criticism and accountability.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring all key points are included with the moral framing intact. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token as instructed.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has suggested delaying the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides a detailed accounting of its actions during the Benghazi attacks. The attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, have become a focal point for criticism of the administration’s handling of the incident. Graham emphasized the need for transparency, questioning whether the White House made efforts to help the besieged outpost by contacting the Libyan government. He accused the administration of delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling, calling for Obama to be held accountable for his leadership during the national crisis. Graham also vowed to apply the same scrutiny to CIA nominee John Brennan. Meanwhile, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe threatened to filibuster Hagel’s nomination, while Democrats criticized Graham’s actions as unprecedented and inappropriate, arguing that he is using the tragedy to block nominations. END OF SUMMARY.
