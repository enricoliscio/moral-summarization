Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and specified the morally charged words to include. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the context and the key points.

The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham's actions regarding the confirmation of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan. Graham is using the Benghazi attacks as leverage to demand more information from the Obama administration. The morally framed words include "attacks," "killed," "allow," "stop," "producing," "delayed," "denied," "deceived," "stonewalled," "leadership," "attack," and "crisis." I need to ensure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll outline the main points: Graham is delaying the confirmation of Hagel and Brennan until the White House provides details about their actions during the Benghazi attacks. He's critical of the administration's handling of the incident, accusing them of not taking sufficient action. He's using aggressive tactics, like demanding testimony and threatening to filibuster. The Democrats support the nominations, while Republicans oppose them, citing concerns about Hagel's stance on Israel and Iran.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using the specified moral words. I should start by stating Graham's intention to delay the confirmations, mention the Benghazi attacks and the casualties, then his accusations of the administration's actions. Include his tactics and the opposing views from Democrats and other Republicans. End with the criticism from Democratic Senator Jack Reed.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and includes all the key points while preserving the moral language. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence incorporates the necessary terms without being too verbose.

After drafting, I'll check the word count and adjust if needed. Also, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for the CIA and Defense Department, including Chuck Hagel, until the White House provides a detailed account of its actions during the Benghazi attacks. Graham criticized the administration for failing to act decisively, accusing it of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" in its handling of the crisis. He emphasized the need for accountability, particularly regarding whether the White House contacted the Libyan government to assist the besieged U.S. outpost. Graham’s actions reflect broader Republican concerns about Hagel’s support for Israel and his stance on military action against Iran. Other Republicans, like Sen. James Inhofe, have threatened to filibuster Hagel’s nomination, while Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, have criticized Graham’s tactics as "unprecedented" and inappropriate, given the tragedy of the attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. END OF SUMMARY.
