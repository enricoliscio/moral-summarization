SUMMARY:

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is threatening to hold up the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more information about the president's actions on the night of the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is demanding to know what the president did to help the Americans under attack and why no follow-up calls were made after the initial 30-minute conversation with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. Graham's actions are seen as unprecedented by Democrats, who accuse him of using the tragedy to block nominations. However, Graham believes that the White House has been "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and that the president must be held accountable for his leadership during the crisis. The senator's moral stance is clear: transparency and accountability are essential in times of national crisis, and the White House must come clean about its actions.
