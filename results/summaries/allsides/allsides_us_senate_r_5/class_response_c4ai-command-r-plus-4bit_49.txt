SUMMARY: South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham threatens to hold up President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and Defense Department, demanding more details about the administration's response to the Benghazi terror attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham accuses the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling," and vows to hold the president "accountable" for his leadership during the incident. He questions the White House's actions on the night of the attacks, including whether they contacted the Libyan government for help and pressed them to allow a response team to leave the airport. Graham's actions are criticized by Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed as "unprecedented" and "inappropriate." Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe threatens to filibuster the Defense Department nominee, Chuck Hagel, requiring 60 votes for confirmation. Democrats support Hagel, but Republicans express concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran. Graham demands an "accounting" of the president's actions and insists on "no confirmation without information."
