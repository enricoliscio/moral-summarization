SUMMARY:
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding more information from the White House about the night of the Benghazi terror attacks before confirming President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. Graham claims the White House has "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" and wants to hold them "accountable" for their actions. He questions why no follow-up calls were made after a 30-minute phone conversation between Obama and his officials. Graham also wants to know if the president pressed the Libyan government to let a response team reach the U.S. outpost under attack. Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, call Graham's actions "unprecedented" and say it's "not appropriate" to dwell on the tragedy to block nominations. Graham's efforts are seen as an attempt to block the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director. END OF SUMMARY.
