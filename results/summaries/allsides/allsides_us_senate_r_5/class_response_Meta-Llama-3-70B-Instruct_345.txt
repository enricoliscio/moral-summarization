SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding an "accounting" from the White House regarding the Benghazi terror attacks that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham wants to know what President Obama and top administration officials did on the night of the attacks, including whether they "pressed" the Libyan government to let a response team reach the U.S. outpost. He is threatening to hold up the appointments of CIA and Defense Department nominees until he gets answers. Graham has been critical of the White House's handling of the "incident" and has accused them of "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" information. He wants to know why no follow-up calls were made after a 30-minute phone conversation between Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Graham's actions have been called "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes it's "not appropriate" to dwell on the "tragedy" to block nominations. END OF SUMMARY.
