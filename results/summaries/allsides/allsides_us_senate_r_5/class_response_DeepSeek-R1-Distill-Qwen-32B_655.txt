Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham trying to delay the confirmation of Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department. He's doing this because he wants more information about the White House's actions during the Benghazi attacks. The attacks killed Ambassador Stevens and three others. Graham is using strong language like "accountable," "attacks," "killed," and "crisis." 

I need to make sure the summary includes these words. I should also mention that Graham is critical of the White House's handling and that he's using tactics like holding up confirmations. Also, other senators' reactions, like Inhofe threatening a filibuster and Reed calling it unprecedented, are important.

I'll structure the summary to first state Graham's actions, then the reasons, include the moral words, and conclude with the political implications. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it flows naturally while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides a full accounting of its actions during the Benghazi attacks. The attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, have become a focal point for criticism of the administration's handling of the incident. Graham has accused the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling," insisting that Obama must be held accountable for his leadership during the crisis. He has also questioned whether the president pressed the Libyan government to assist the besieged outpost. Graham's actions have drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue that his focus on the tragedy to block nominations is "unprecedented" and inappropriate. Meanwhile, Sen. James Inhofe has threatened to filibuster the Hagel nomination, requiring 60 votes for confirmation. The Republican opposition to Hagel centers on concerns about his support for Israel and potential reluctance to engage in military action against Iran. END OF SUMMARY.
