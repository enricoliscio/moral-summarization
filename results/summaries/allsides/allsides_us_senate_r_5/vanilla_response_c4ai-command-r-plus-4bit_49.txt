SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina vows to hold up the appointments of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department, demanding more details about the administration's response to the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is seeking information on the actions of the President and other top officials during the night of the attacks, including whether they contacted the Libyan government for help. He is also asking about any follow-up calls made by the President after an initial conversation with Defense officials. Graham threatens to block the confirmation hearings for Chuck Hagel and John Brennan until his demands are met. He is supported by Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe, who threatens to filibuster the Hagel nomination. Democrats support the President's nominations, while Republicans express concerns about Hagel's stance on Israel and Iran. Graham accuses the White House of stonewalling and demands accountability from the President. Rhode Island Democratic Senator Jack Reed criticizes Graham's actions as unprecedented and inappropriate.
