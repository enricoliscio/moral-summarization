Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Sen. Lindsey Graham's actions regarding the confirmation of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Graham is delaying the confirmations until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi attacks. He's critical of the administration's handling of the situation and wants accountability. 

I should highlight the key elements: Graham's threat to hold up confirmations, his reasons (lack of information about the administration's response), the political context (Republicans vs. Democrats), and the implications for the nominees and the administration's credibility.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral perspective, which emphasizes accountability and transparency. I'll structure it to show Graham's actions, the reasons behind them, and the reactions from both sides.

Also, I should note that while Graham hasn't filibustered yet, he's using other tactics, and other Republicans like Inhofe are considering more drastic measures. The Democrats are opposing this, calling it inappropriate.

Putting it all together, the summary should convey that Graham is using the confirmation process to push for answers about Benghazi, highlighting the political tension and the moral imperative for accountability.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides detailed information about its response to the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Graham, a critic of Defense Secretary nominee Chuck Hagel, argues that the administration has not adequately explained its actions during the attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. He has called for accountability, stating, “No confirmation without information,” and has pushed for outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to testify about the incident. While Graham has not threatened a filibuster, he has taken other aggressive steps to delay the process. Meanwhile, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe has threatened to filibuster Hagel’s nomination, requiring 60 votes for confirmation. Democrats support Hagel, but many Republicans oppose him due to concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran. Graham has accused the White House of delaying, denying, and deceiving regarding its response to the attacks, insisting that Obama must account for his leadership. Democratic Sen. Jack Reed has criticized Graham’s actions as “unprecedented” and inappropriate. END OF SUMMARY.
