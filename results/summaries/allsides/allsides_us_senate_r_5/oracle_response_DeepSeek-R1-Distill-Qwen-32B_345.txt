Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham delaying the confirmation of Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until more information is provided about the Benghazi attacks. The author uses words like "attacks," "killed," "allow," "stop," "producing," "delayed," "denied," "deceived," "stonewalled," "leadership," "attack," and "crisis." These words carry moral weight, so I need to include them in the summary.

First, I'll identify the main elements: Graham's actions, the Benghazi incident, the nominees, and the moral implications. I should mention that Graham is delaying the confirmations, the names of the nominees, and the reasons he's doing so, which include accountability and the handling of the crisis.

I also need to note the opposition from Democrats and the criticism from other senators. Including the specific moral terms will help maintain the author's framing. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically.

Let me structure the summary: start with Graham's suggestion to delay confirmations, mention the Benghazi attacks and the casualties, his demand for accountability, the specific nominees, and the moral terms used. Then, touch on the opposition from Democrats and the broader implications of his actions.

I need to ensure that all the key points are covered without exceeding the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral framing words and that the summary is coherent.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has suggested delaying the confirmation of President Obama’s nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides details about its response to the Benghazi attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham criticized the administration’s handling of the crisis, accusing it of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling." He emphasized the need for accountability, questioning whether the White House contacted the Libyan government to assist during the eight-hour attack. Graham also vowed to block the nomination of John Brennan for the CIA unless the White House provides more information. Democrats, including Sen. Jack Reed, criticized Graham’s actions as "unprecedented" and inappropriate, while other Republicans, like Sen. James Inhofe, threatened to filibuster Hagel’s nomination. The opposition to Hagel centers on concerns about his support for Israel and potential reluctance to stop Iran’s nuclear program. Graham’s focus on the White House’s leadership during the crisis has sparked debate over transparency and accountability in handling national security. END OF SUMMARY.
