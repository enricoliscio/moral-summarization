SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina vowed to hold up the appointments of President Obama's nominees to lead the CIA and the Defense Department until the White House provides a full accounting of the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham is demanding answers to crucial questions, including whether the White House made any attempts to call the Libyan government for help during the attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham accused the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and believes they must be held accountable for their leadership during this national crisis. He also questioned the lack of follow-up calls from the president after the initial conversation with Defense officials. Graham's actions have been deemed "unprecedented" and "inappropriate" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes that Graham is using the tragedy to block nominations. Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe has threatened to filibuster the Defense Department nominee, Chuck Hagel, who faces opposition from Republicans over concerns about his support for Israel and Iran. Graham is determined to uncover the truth behind the White House's response to the Benghazi incident, demanding information before confirmation.
END OF SUMMARY.
