SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to block President Obama's nominees for key positions until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi terror attack. Graham accuses the administration of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and demands an accounting of the president's actions during the night of the attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham questions whether the White House made any efforts to call the Libyan government for help and if the president pressed Libya to allow a response team to assist. He pledges to hold Obama "accountable" for his leadership during the crisis and vows to block the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA Director. Democrat Jack Reed calls Graham's actions "unprecedented" and inappropriate. Graham's move is part of a broader Republican opposition to Hagel's nomination over concerns about his support for Israel and his stance on Iran's nuclear program.
