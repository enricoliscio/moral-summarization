Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham holding up President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until more information is provided about the Benghazi attacks. He's critical of Chuck Hagel and the White House's handling of the incident. Graham wants to know what the White House did that night, like whether they contacted the Libyan government for help. He's using the confirmation hearings for Hagel and Brennan as leverage, saying no confirmation without information. He hasn't filibustered but has pushed for Panetta's testimony. Other Republicans, like Inhofe, are also opposing Hagel over concerns about Israel and Iran. Democrats support the nominations, but Republicans are mostly against. Graham is pressing for accountability, and another senator, Reed, thinks his actions are unprecedented and inappropriate.

So, the summary should cover Graham's actions, his reasons, the impact on nominations, other Republicans' stances, and the Democratic response. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start by stating Graham's suggestion, then his reasons, the nominees involved, his methods, other Republicans' actions, and the opposing views. I'll make sure to include key points like the delay, denial, deception claims, and the focus on accountability.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has threatened to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA director, John Brennan, and Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, until the White House provides more details about its response to the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Graham, a vocal critic of the administration's handling of the incident, has demanded accountability from the White House, questioning whether the president or other officials contacted the Libyan government for assistance during the attacks. He has also pushed for outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to testify about the incident. While Graham has not filibustered Hagel's nomination, he has taken other steps to delay the process. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe has threatened to filibuster Hagel's confirmation, requiring a 60-vote majority. Republicans oppose Hagel over concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran, while Democrats support the nomination. Graham has accused the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and insists on answers about the president's actions during the attacks. Democratic Sen. Jack Reed has criticized Graham's tactics as "unprecedented" and inappropriate. END OF SUMMARY.
