SUMMARY:

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is demanding accountability from the White House regarding the Benghazi terror attacks that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Graham wants to know what President Obama and top administration officials were doing on the night of the attacks and is threatening to hold up the confirmation of Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until he gets an accounting. Graham is critical of the White House's handling of the incident and is seeking answers to questions such as whether the president pressed the Libyan government to help the Americans under attack. Graham's actions have been called "unprecedented" by Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who believes that dwelling on the tragedy to block nominations is "not appropriate." However, Graham remains resolute, accusing the White House of having "delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled" and vowing to hold Obama accountable for his leadership during the crisis.
