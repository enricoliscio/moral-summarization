SUMMARY:
Sen. Lindsey Graham vows to hold up the appointment of President Obama's nominees to run the CIA and the Defense Department, demanding more details about the administration's response to the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham accuses the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and calls for accountability from the president himself. He questions the actions of Obama and other top officials on the night of the Benghazi tragedy that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham's aggressive tactics are deemed "unprecedented" and "inappropriate" by Sen. Jack Reed, who believes Graham is using the tragedy to block nominations. Meanwhile, Sen. James Inhofe threatens to filibuster the nomination of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary, citing concerns over Israel and Iran. Republicans largely oppose Hagel, despite Democratic support. Graham insists on knowing if the president contacted the Libyan government for help during the attack and demands to know why there were no follow-up calls after the initial conversation. He pledges to hold Obama "accountable" for his leadership during the national crisis.
