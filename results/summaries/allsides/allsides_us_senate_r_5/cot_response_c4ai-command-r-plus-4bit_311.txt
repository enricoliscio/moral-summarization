SUMMARY: 
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham threatens to block the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department chiefs unless the White House provides more details about its response to the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham accuses the administration of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and demands to know if they contacted the Libyan government for help during the eight-hour attack. He questions the president's leadership during the national crisis, asking why there were no follow-up calls after the initial conversation. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe threatens a filibuster against the Hagel nomination, while Democrats support the president's choice. The Benghazi incident, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans, has sparked criticism and calls for accountability from Graham and other Republicans. They demand answers about the White House's actions during this tragic event. Graham's actions are labeled as *unprecedented* and *inappropriate* by Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed.
