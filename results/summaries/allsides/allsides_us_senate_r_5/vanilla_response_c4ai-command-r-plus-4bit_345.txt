SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina threatened to hold up the appointments of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department, Chuck Hagel and John Brennan, respectively. Graham aims to pressure the White House to provide more details about the president's actions during the Benghazi terror attacks on September 11, 2012, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Graham questioned the lack of follow-up calls between Obama and military leaders after an initial conversation on the day of the attacks. He also inquired about the president's efforts to secure assistance from the Libyan government. Graham vowed to hold Obama "accountable" and demanded answers, stating, "We know nothing about what the president did during the night of Sept. 11 during a night of national crisis." Meanwhile, Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe threatened to filibuster Hagel's nomination. Democrats support Obama's choices, but Republicans express concerns about Hagel's stance on Israel and Iran. Rhode Island Democratic Senator Jack Reed criticized Graham's actions as "unprecedented" and "inappropriate."
