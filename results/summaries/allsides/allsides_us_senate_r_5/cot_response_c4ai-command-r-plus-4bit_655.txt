SUMMARY:
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatened to block President Obama's nominees for key positions, demanding more details about the administration's response to the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham accused the White House of stonewalling and demanded accountability from the President regarding his actions during the night of the attacks. He questioned the lack of follow-up calls and the absence of communication with the Libyan government for assistance. Graham's actions were deemed "unprecedented" and "inappropriate" by Democratic Senator Jack Reed, who believes that Graham is using the Benghazi tragedy to block nominations. The Senator's aggressive moves come amidst concerns about the nominees' support for Israel and their stance on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe also threatened to filibuster the Hagel nomination. Graham insists that Obama must be held accountable for his leadership during the Benghazi crisis, demanding answers to crucial questions about that fateful night.
