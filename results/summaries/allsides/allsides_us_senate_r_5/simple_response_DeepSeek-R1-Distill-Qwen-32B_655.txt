Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggesting he'll delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi attacks. He's critical of Chuck Hagel's nomination and wants accountability from the White House regarding their actions during the attacks.

Graham is questioning whether the White House contacted Libyan officials for help and wants more information before confirming Hagel as Secretary of Defense. He's using the confirmation hearings as leverage, stating "No confirmation without information." He hasn't filibustered but has taken other steps like calling for Obama to withdraw the nomination and getting Leon Panetta to testify.

Another Republican, James Inhofe, threatened a filibuster to require 60 votes for Hagel's confirmation. Democrats support the nomination, but Republicans oppose it, citing concerns about Hagel's stance on Israel and Iran's nuclear program.

Graham has been pushing for details about the White House's response that night, accusing them of delaying and stonewalling. He's focused on whether Obama tried to get Libyan help for the outpost under attack. Other Democrats, like Jack Reed, criticize Graham's actions as unprecedented and inappropriate, using the tragedy to block nominations.

So, the summary needs to capture Graham's actions, his reasons, the political implications, and the opposing viewpoints. I should make sure to include the moral aspects, like accountability and the appropriateness of using the tragedy for political leverage.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll condense each point without losing the essence. Make sure to mention the key players, their actions, and the underlying moral framing from the author, which seems critical of Graham's tactics.
