Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, who is holding up President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department. He wants more information about what happened during the Benghazi attacks. The attacks killed Ambassador Stevens and three others, so it's a significant event.

Graham is critical of Chuck Hagel, the nominee for Defense Secretary, and the White House's handling of the situation. He's saying that Hagel shouldn't be confirmed until they get answers. He's also doing the same with John Brennan's nomination for CIA director, using the "no confirmation without information" approach.

Graham hasn't filibustered yet but has been aggressive in other ways, like calling for Obama to withdraw the nomination and getting Leon Panetta to testify. Another senator, Inhofe, is threatening a filibuster to require 60 votes instead of a simple majority. Democrats support the nominations, but Republicans are mostly against Hagel due to concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran.

Graham wants to know why there were no follow-up calls from the White House and whether the president pressured Libya to help. He's been critical, saying the White House has delayed, denied, deceived, and stonewalled. Democratic Senator Reed calls his actions unprecedented and inappropriate.

So, the moral framing here is about accountability and transparency. Graham is pushing for answers, which is about holding the administration accountable. The article presents this as a conflict between Republicans seeking information and Democrats defending the nominees. It's important to keep that tension in the summary.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures all the key points without losing the moral aspect. I'll start by mentioning Graham's actions, the nominees, his demands, and the political dynamics. I'll also include the criticism from Reed and the implications for transparency and accountability.

Let me structure it: introduce Graham's move, explain why (Benghazi), mention the nominees, his specific demands, the methods he's using, other Republicans' actions, Democratic support, and the criticism from Reed. Then conclude with the broader implications.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts as presented, but ensure the moral framing is clear. That is, the issue is about accountability and whether the administration is being transparent. So the summary should reflect that this is a significant issue in terms of governance and responsibility.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has vowed to delay the confirmation of President Obama's nominees for the CIA and Defense Department until the White House provides more details about its response during the Benghazi attacks. Graham is particularly critical of Defense Secretary nominee Chuck Hagel and the administration's handling of the 2012 attacks, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. He has demanded accountability from the White House, questioning whether the administration made efforts to assist the besieged outpost and whether President Obama took appropriate action during the crisis. Graham has also threatened to withhold confirmation for CIA nominee John Brennan until these questions are addressed, stating, "No confirmation without information." While he has not filibustered, Graham has taken other aggressive steps, such as calling for Obama to withdraw Hagel's nomination and securing testimony from outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe has threatened to filibuster Hagel's nomination, requiring 60 votes for confirmation. Democrats support the nominations, but many Republicans oppose Hagel due to concerns about his stance on Israel and Iran. Graham has accused the White House of stonewalling and delaying information, while Democratic Sen. Jack Reed has criticized Graham's tactics as unprecedented and inappropriate. The debate highlights tensions over transparency and accountability in the administration's response to the Benghazi attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
