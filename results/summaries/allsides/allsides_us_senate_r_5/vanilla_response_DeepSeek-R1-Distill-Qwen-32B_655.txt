Alright, so I need to help the user summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article is about Senator Lindsey Graham holding up Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department until more details about the Benghazi attacks are revealed. 

Okay, the main points are: Graham is a Republican senator from South Carolina. He's critical of Chuck Hagel, the Defense nominee, and wants more info on what the White House did during the Benghazi attacks. He's threatening to delay the confirmations without answers. 

I should note that the attacks happened in 2012, killed Ambassador Stevens and others. Graham mentioned on CBS that he won't allow Hagel's confirmation without an accounting. He also wants to know if the White House contacted Libyan officials for help. 

He's not filibustering yet, but has other tactics like demanding Panetta's testimony. Another Republican, Inhofe, threatened a filibuster. Democrats support Hagel, but Republicans oppose him due to concerns about Israel and Iran. 

Graham started pushing for details last week, saying the White House has been evasive. He's questioning Obama's leadership and whether he pressured Libya to help. A Democratic senator, Reed, called Graham's actions unprecedented and inappropriate.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, focusing on Graham's actions, the reasons, and the political implications. Make sure to include key details without getting too wordy. Also, the summary should start after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Let me structure it: Start with Graham's threat, mention the nominees, the Benghazi attacks, his demands, his tactics, Inhofe's threat, the reasons for Republican opposition, the timeline of his actions, and the criticism from Reed. Keep it concise and clear.
