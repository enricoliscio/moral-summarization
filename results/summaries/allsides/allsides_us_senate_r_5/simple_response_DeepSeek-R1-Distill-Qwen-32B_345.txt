Okay, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing that the author presented. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, the article is about Senator Lindsey Graham trying to delay the confirmation of Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Secretary until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi attacks. He's critical of the administration's handling of the situation, especially regarding what the president and others did that night. He mentions that the White House hasn't been transparent and that they should provide an accounting before confirming the nominees. He's using this as leverage, saying "No confirmation without information."

Graham is also concerned about whether the White House contacted the Libyan government for help. He's taking aggressive actions, like pushing for the outgoing Defense Secretary to testify, but hasn't filibustered yet. Another senator, Inhofe, threatens a filibuster to require 60 votes for Hagel's confirmation. The Republicans are opposed to Hagel over concerns about his support for Israel and Iran policy, while Democrats support the nomination.

Graham has been pushing for accountability, questioning the White House's actions, and accusing them of delaying information. He's critical of the administration's response during the crisis. Democratic Senator Reed calls Graham's actions unprecedented and inappropriate, using the tragedy to block nominations.

Now, I need to capture all this in a summary under 200 words, preserving the moral framing. I should highlight Graham's actions, his reasons, the implications, and the opposing views. I'll structure it by first stating Graham's stance, then his methods, the opposition from Democrats, and the broader implications.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, starts with the main action, and includes the key points without getting too bogged down in details. Also, maintain the moral perspective, which seems to be about accountability and transparency versus partisanship.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each sentence covers a main point without exceeding the word limit.
