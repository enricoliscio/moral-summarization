SUMMARY: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham threatens to block President Obama's nominees for CIA and Defense Department chief until the White House provides more details about the Benghazi terror attacks. Graham accuses the White House of delaying, denying, and deceiving the public about the events of that night, including the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Graham demands to know if the White House called the Libyan government for help during the attack and if the president pressed Libya to allow a response team to intervene. He questions the lack of follow-up calls and the president's leadership during the crisis. Senator James Inhofe threatens a filibuster against the Defense nominee, Chuck Hagel, while Democrats support the president's nomination. Republicans oppose Hagel over concerns about his support for Israel and Iran's nuclear program. Senator Jack Reed calls Graham's actions "unprecedented" and inappropriate, dwelling on the tragedy to block nominations. Graham insists on accountability and information before confirmations.
END OF SUMMARY.
