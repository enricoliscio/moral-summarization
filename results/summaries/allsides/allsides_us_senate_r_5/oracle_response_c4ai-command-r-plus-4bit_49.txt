SUMMARY: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina threatened to hold up the appointments of Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary and John Brennan as CIA director unless the White House provides more details about President Obama's actions during the Benghazi terror attack. Graham is among those who have criticized the administration's handling of the attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. He questioned whether the White House made any attempts to contact the Libyan government for help during the crisis. Graham accused the White House of "delaying, denying, deceiving, and stonewalling" and demanded that Obama be held "accountable" for his leadership during the incident. Meanwhile, Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe threatened to filibuster the Hagel nomination, citing concerns over Hagel's support for Israel and his stance on Iran's nuclear program. Democrats have supported the president's nominations, but Republicans remain largely opposed. Graham insisted that more information is needed about the White House's response to the attacks and the president's actions during the night of the crisis. Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed called Graham's actions "unprecedented" and inappropriate.
END OF SUMMARY.
