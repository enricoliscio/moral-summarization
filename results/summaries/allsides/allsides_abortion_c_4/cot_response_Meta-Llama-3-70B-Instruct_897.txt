SUMMARY:
The Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argues that the law "likely" violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech. The law forces licensed pregnancy centers to post notices about free or low-cost state programs that include abortion services, which the petitioners claim is a form of forced advertising for abortion. The decision has sparked concerns that it could have unintended consequences, putting laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about the growth of their fetus at risk. The ruling has been met with criticism from liberal justices and reproductive rights advocates, who argue that the decision gives "fake health centers" a free speech right to deceive pregnant women.
