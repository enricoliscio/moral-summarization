SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has struck down a California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the law violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech. The law forced licensed clinics to provide a government-drafted script about state-sponsored services, including abortion, which goes against the centers' anti-abortion stance. The decision could have unintended consequences, potentially putting at risk laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth. Liberal justices dissented, arguing that the law is necessary to inform women of their rights to an abortion. The ruling is seen as a victory for free speech rights, but critics argue that it allows "fake health centers" to deceive pregnant women.
