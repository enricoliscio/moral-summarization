SUMMARY:

The Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the law "likely" violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech. The court's conservatives claimed that the law forces pregnancy centers to provide free advertising for abortion, imposing a government-drafted script that targets their anti-abortion views. In contrast, liberal justices argued that the law is necessary to notify women of their rights to an abortion and to prevent deception by pregnancy centers that pose as medical clinics. The decision may have unintended consequences, putting laws in conservative states that require women to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth at risk. The ruling gives "fake health centers" a free speech right to deceive pregnant women, according to critics.
