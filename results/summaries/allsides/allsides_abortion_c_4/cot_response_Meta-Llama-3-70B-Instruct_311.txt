SUMMARY:
The Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the law "likely" violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech, forcing these centers to provide a government-drafted script about the availability of state-sponsored services. The court's conservatives believe that the law targets only clinics that counsel women to complete their pregnancies, violating their convictions on deeply divisive subjects such as abortion. In contrast, liberal justices argue that the law is necessary to prevent deceit and misinformation by pregnancy centers that pose as medical clinics. The ruling may have unintended consequences, putting laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about the growth of their fetus at risk.
