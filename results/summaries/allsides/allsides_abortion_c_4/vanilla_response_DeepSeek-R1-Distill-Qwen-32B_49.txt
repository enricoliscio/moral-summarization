Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Supreme Court ruling on California's law regarding anti-abortion pregnancy centers. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article says that the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against California's law, which required these centers to inform women about state-funded abortion and contraception services. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion, stating that the law likely violates the First Amendment because it compels speech. He mentioned that the clinics have to provide a government script about abortion services, which they oppose.

Justice Anthony Kennedy agreed, calling it a threat to individual speech. The ruling might have unintended consequences, possibly affecting laws in conservative states that require ultrasounds or fetal development information before abortions. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, questioning why doctors can inform about adoption but not about abortion services.

California's law forces licensed centers to post notices about free services, including abortion, and unlicensed ones to state they're not medical facilities. Challengers argue it's compelled speech, with Michael Farris saying it forces pro-life centers to advertise abortion against their beliefs.

During arguments, conservatives felt the law targets pro-life clinics, while liberals compared it to informed consent laws. The state claims many centers mislead women, pretending to be medical clinics. The ruling could impact other laws requiring postings, like health instructions or handwashing.

So, to summarize, the key points are:

- Supreme Court rules 5-4 against California's law requiring anti-abortion centers to inform about state services.
- The law is seen as compelled speech violating the First Amendment.
- Potential impact on other state laws requiring information before abortions.
- Dissenters argue it's about informed consent.
- The ruling could affect other posting requirements beyond abortion.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include the main elements: the court's decision, the reasoning, the consequences, and the opposing views.
