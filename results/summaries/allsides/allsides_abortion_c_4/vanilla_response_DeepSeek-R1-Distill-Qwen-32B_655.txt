Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Supreme Court ruling on California's law regarding anti-abortion pregnancy centers. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it has to be returned after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against California's law, saying it likely violates the First Amendment. The law required these centers to inform women about state-funded abortion and contraception services. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion, calling it compelled speech. Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing the threat to individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Breyer, questioned why the state couldn't inform women about their options.

California's law also required unlicensed centers to state they aren't medical facilities. Challengers argued it forces them to promote abortion against their beliefs. The ruling could affect similar laws in conservative states, like those requiring ultrasounds before abortions. The state argued that many centers mislead clients, especially since many pregnancies are unintended.

I need to condense all this into a summary. I'll start by stating the court's ruling, the vote, the reason (First Amendment), and the key points from both sides. I'll mention the implications for other states and the state's argument about misleading information. I'll keep it under 200 words, making sure it's clear and concise.
