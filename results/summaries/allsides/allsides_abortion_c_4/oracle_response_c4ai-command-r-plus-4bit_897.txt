SUMMARY: The Supreme Court deals a blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about abortion services, ruling that it "likely" violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. The law forces licensed clinics to provide information about state-sponsored abortion services and contact information for obtaining them. Justice Clarence Thomas calls this a form of "government-drafted" speech that threatens individual expression. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurs, stating that the law imposes a government message over that of the individual. The decision, aimed at notifying pregnant women of abortion rights, may have unintended consequences for conservative state laws requiring women to view ultrasounds before abortions. The four liberal justices dissent, arguing that if doctors can be required to inform women of adoption services, then medical counselors should also inform women about childbirth and abortion services. The law also requires unlicensed centers to disclose that they are not medical facilities, with challengers calling it forced advertising for abortion. The ruling gives so-called fake health centers a free speech right to deceive pregnant women, according to critics. The Court has previously defended free speech in cases involving pregnancy centers and cities, with a focus on viewpoint discrimination.
END OF SUMMARY.
