SUMMARY:
In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court struck down a California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by the court's conservative bloc, argued that the law violates the First Amendment by compelling pro-life centers to promote abortion services, which goes against their convictions. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, stating that the law forces centers to adopt the government's message, infringing on free speech. The decision protects pro-life centers from what they saw as compelled advertising for abortion. 

The court's liberals dissented, arguing that if doctors are required to inform women about alternatives to abortion, then pregnancy centers should also be required to provide information about abortion services. California and pro-choice advocates defended the law, stating that many pregnancy centers deceive women by posing as medical clinics, and that women have a right to know all their options. This ruling gives "fake health centers a free speech right to dress up like medical centers and deceive pregnant women," said a critic. The decision highlights the moral divide on abortion and free speech, with potential unintended consequences for conservative states' laws on abortion counseling.
