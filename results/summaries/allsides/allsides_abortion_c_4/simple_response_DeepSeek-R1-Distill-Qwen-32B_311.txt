Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against a California law requiring anti-abortion centers to inform women about abortion services. The majority, led by Justice Thomas, said it violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. The dissenters, including Justice Breyer, argued that if doctors can inform about alternatives, why not these centers. California's law also requires unlicensed centers to disclose they're not medical facilities.

I need to capture the moral arguments from both sides. The pro-life side sees it as forcing them to promote abortion against their beliefs. The pro-choice side argues it's about informed consent and preventing deception.

I should structure the summary to include the ruling, the moral arguments from both sides, and the potential consequences for other states' laws. Keep it under 200 words, concise, and clear, preserving the moral framing as presented.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to highlight the compelled speech issue and the opposing viewpoints on informed consent versus deception.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about state-funded abortion and contraception services, deeming it a violation of the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the conservative majority, criticized the law for forcing pro-life clinics to promote abortion services they oppose. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a threat to individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, argued that if states can require doctors to inform women about alternatives to abortion, they should also require pregnancy centers to provide similar information. California's law also mandates unlicensed centers to disclose they are not medical facilities. Pro-life advocates, like Michael Farris, argue the law forces them to advertise abortion against their convictions, while pro-choice groups, such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, claim the law prevents deception by centers posing as medical clinics. The ruling could impact similar laws in conservative states requiring abortion counseling. END OF SUMMARY.
