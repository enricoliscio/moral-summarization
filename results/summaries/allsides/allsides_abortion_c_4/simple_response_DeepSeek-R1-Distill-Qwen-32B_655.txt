Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about the Supreme Court ruling on a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about state-funded abortion services. The court ruled 5-4 against the law, saying it violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion, while Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing the threat to individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Breyer, argued that the law is similar to other informed consent requirements. The state of California defends the law, claiming it prevents deceptive practices by pregnancy centers, especially since many women have unintended pregnancies. The ruling could affect similar laws in conservative states, potentially weakening requirements for abortion procedures. The case highlights the tension between free speech rights and informed consent in medical settings.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. The summary should include the court's decision, the reasoning from both sides, the implications for other states, and the broader debate on free speech versus informed consent.

I should start by stating the court's ruling and its 5-4 split. Then, mention the majority's argument about compelled speech and the dissent's comparison to informed consent laws. Include California's justification about preventing deception and the potential impact on other states. Finally, note the tension between free speech and informed consent.

Let me structure this clearly, making sure each point flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll ensure that the moral perspectives from both sides are represented accurately.
