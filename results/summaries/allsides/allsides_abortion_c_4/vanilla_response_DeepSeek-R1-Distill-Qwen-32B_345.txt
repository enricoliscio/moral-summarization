Alright, I need to summarize the given news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the key points.

The article is about a Supreme Court ruling on a California law related to anti-abortion pregnancy centers. The law requires these centers to inform women about state-funded abortion and contraception services. The Court ruled 5-4 against the law, saying it likely violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion, pointing out that the law forces clinics to provide a government script, including abortion information, which the centers oppose.

Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a threat to individual speech. On the other hand, Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, questioning why the law is invalid when similar requirements for doctors are upheld. The law also requires unlicensed centers to inform clients they're not medical facilities.

The decision could affect other states' laws requiring ultrasounds or fetal information before abortions. The challengers argue it's compelled speech, forcing pro-life centers to advertise abortion. The state claims many centers mislead clients, posing as medical clinics. The ruling may impact other required postings, like health instructions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: the ruling, the reasoning, the implications, and the opposing views.

I'll start by stating the Supreme Court struck down the California law, explaining the majority opinion and the dissent. Then mention the potential consequences on other states' laws and the debate over compelled speech versus misleading information.

I should make sure to include the 5-4 vote, the compelled speech argument, the implications for other laws, and the state's perspective on misleading centers. Also, note the broader impact on required postings.

Let me structure it: introduce the ruling, explain the majority's reasoning, mention the dissent, discuss the implications, and conclude with the broader impact.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll avoid getting too detailed on each point but ensure all key elements are covered.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to strike down a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about state-funded abortion and contraception services, deeming it a violation of the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the conservative majority, criticized the law for forcing clinics to promote abortion services they oppose. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a threat to free speech. Dissenting Justice Stephen Breyer argued the law was no different from upheld requirements for doctors to provide abortion-related information. The ruling could impact similar laws in conservative states requiring ultrasounds or fetal information before abortions. The state defended the law, claiming many pregnancy centers mislead clients by posing as medical clinics. The decision also raises questions about other required postings, like health instructions.
