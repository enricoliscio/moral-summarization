SUMMARY: In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court dealt a blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The court, with Justice Clarence Thomas writing the majority opinion, said the law likely violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, called the law a threat to individual speech, thought, and expression. The decision could have unintended consequences for laws in conservative states requiring women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal development. The four liberal justices dissented, arguing that if a state can require doctors to tell women about adoption services, they should also be able to require pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion services. The case was brought by the Alliance Defending Freedom, who argued that the law forced pregnancy centers to advertise abortion services against their convictions. The court's ruling defends free speech rights while also upholding abortion as legal nationwide. 

END OF SUMMARY.
