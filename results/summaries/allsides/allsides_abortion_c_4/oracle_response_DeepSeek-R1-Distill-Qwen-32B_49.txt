Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article and specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Supreme Court ruled on a California law requiring anti-abortion centers to provide information about abortion services, which they saw as compelled speech. The majority opinion was written by Justice Thomas, and Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing the threat of government-imposed messages. The dissenting justices, led by Breyer, argued that the law was about informed consent. California's law was about notifying women of their options, but the court struck it down, possibly affecting other states' laws. The centers argued it was forced advertising against their beliefs. The article also mentions that the ruling could put other required postings on shaky ground.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided and ensure they are included. Words like compelled, government-drafted, threat, impose, notify, abortion, require, forced, targets, deceive, misinform, know, gives, dress, struck, block, discriminate, put, aid. 

I'll structure the summary to highlight the court's decision, the moral arguments from both sides, and the potential consequences. I'll make sure to use the specified words to maintain the moral framing. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key points without losing the essence of the article.

I should start by stating the court's ruling, then the majority and dissenting opinions, followed by the implications and the centers' arguments. I'll ensure each part includes the morally charged words where appropriate. Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to provide information about state-funded abortion and contraception services likely violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the conservative majority, criticized the law as government-drafted and a threat to free expression, forcing pro-life centers to advertise abortion services they oppose. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a paradigmatic example of government imposing its message over individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, argued the law was about informed consent, similar to requirements for doctors performing abortions. California contended the law aimed to notify women of their rights and prevent deception by centers posing as medical clinics. Challengers, including the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, argued the law targets pro-life centers and forces them to promote abortion, violating their convictions. The ruling could put similar laws in other states at risk, potentially affecting requirements for ultrasounds or fetal development information. The decision highlights tensions between compelled speech and the government's role in ensuring women know their options, while critics warn it could allow fake health centers to deceive pregnant women. END OF SUMMARY.
