SUMMARY:
The Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the law "likely" violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech. The court's conservatives believed that the law targets only clinics that counsel women to complete their pregnancies, forcing them to provide "free advertising for abortion" against their convictions. In contrast, liberal justices compared it to laws that require doctors performing abortions to advise women about alternatives. The ruling has sparked concerns that it may have unintended consequences, putting laws in conservative states requiring women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about the growth of their fetus at risk. The decision has been met with criticism from reproductive rights advocates, who argue that it gives "fake health centers" a free speech right to deceive pregnant women. END OF SUMMARY.
