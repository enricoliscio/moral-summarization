SUMMARY: 
The Supreme Court ruled against a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The ruling, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, stated that the law likely violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech, with the court's conservatives in the majority. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, stating that the law forces individuals to express a message that goes against their beliefs. The law was intended to notify pregnant women of their rights to abortion and other options, but the ruling could have unintended consequences for similar laws in conservative states. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates argued that informed consent laws are different from counseling women to continue their pregnancies. California argued that many pregnancy centers deceive women by posing as medical clinics. The court's liberals dissented, arguing that the ruling gives fake health centers a free speech right to deceive pregnant women. The case highlights the ongoing debate between moral framing of abortion rights and freedom of speech in the US.
