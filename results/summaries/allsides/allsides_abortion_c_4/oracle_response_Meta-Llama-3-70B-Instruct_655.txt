SUMMARY: The Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to a California law that requires anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the law "likely" violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech, forcing centers to provide a government-drafted script about state-sponsored services. This decision threatens to undermine laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth. The law was aimed at notifying pregnant women of their rights to an abortion, but the court's conservatives saw it as an attempt to impose the government's message on individual speech. The ruling gives "fake health centers" a free speech right to deceive pregnant women, according to critics. This decision could have unintended consequences, putting other required postings, such as first aid instructions, on shaky legal ground. END OF SUMMARY.
