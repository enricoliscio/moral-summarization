Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The Supreme Court ruled against California's law requiring anti-abortion centers to inform women about abortion services. The majority opinion, led by Justice Thomas, said it violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. They argue the law forces pro-life centers to promote abortion, which goes against their beliefs. 

Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing the threat to individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Breyer, questioned why doctors can inform about adoption but not pregnancy centers about abortion. California's law also requires unlicensed centers to state they're not medical facilities. Challengers like Michael Farris argue it's about freedom of speech, especially on divisive issues.

The article mentions that the ruling could affect other states' laws requiring ultrasounds or fetal information. The state of California claims some centers deceive women by posing as medical clinics, especially since many pregnancies are unintended. Supporters of the law, like Nancy Northup, argue against fake centers misleading women. The Court has previously upheld informed consent laws for medical procedures but this case is different since it's about counseling women to continue their pregnancies.

I need to make sure the summary includes all the morally charged words identified, like "anti-abortion," "compelled speech," "deceive," "fake," "pro-life," "pro-choice," "free speech," "discriminate," "deceive," and "coercion." I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflict between free speech and informed consent, the implications for other states, and the perspectives from both sides.

I should start by stating the ruling, then the reasoning, the dissent, the implications, and the broader debate. Keeping it concise but covering all these points without exceeding 200 words. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to reflect the author's perspective accurately.

**SUMMARY:**  

The Supreme Court ruled against a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services, deeming it a form of compelled speech under the First Amendment. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the conservative majority, criticized the law for forcing pro-life centers to promote abortion services, which violates their convictions. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a threat to individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, argued that if states can require doctors to inform women about adoption, they should also allow pregnancy centers to inform about abortion. California's law also mandates unlicensed centers to disclose they are not medical facilities. Challengers, like Michael Farris, argued the law discriminates against pro-life views. The ruling could impact laws in conservative states requiring ultrasounds or fetal information. California countered that some centers deceive women by posing as medical clinics, especially given high rates of unintended pregnancies. The decision highlights the tension between free speech and informed consent, with supporters like Nancy Northup arguing against "fake health centers" misleading women. END OF SUMMARY.
