SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has struck down a California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the law violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech. The law forced licensed pregnancy centers to post notices about free or low-cost state programs that include abortion services, and unlicensed centers to inform clients that they are not medical facilities. The court's conservatives believed the law targeted only pro-life clinics, while liberal justices compared it to laws that require doctors to advise women about alternatives to abortion. The ruling may have unintended consequences, potentially putting at risk laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth.

END OF SUMMARY.
