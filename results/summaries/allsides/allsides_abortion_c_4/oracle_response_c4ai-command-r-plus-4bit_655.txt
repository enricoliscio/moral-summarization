SUMMARY: The Supreme Court has dealt a significant blow to a California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. In a 5-4 ruling, the Court said the law "likely" violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech, with Justice Clarence Thomas stating that it forces licensed clinics to provide a government-drafted script about abortion services. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, saying the law imposes the government's message over individual speech and expression. The decision, aimed at notifying pregnant women of their rights to abortion, may have unintended consequences for conservative state laws requiring women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates challenged the California law, arguing that it forces pro-life pregnancy centers to advertise abortion services against their convictions. The Court's conservatives saw the law as targeting clinics that counsel women to complete pregnancies, while liberal justices compared it to informed consent laws for abortion doctors. California defended the law, stating that pregnancy centers often deceive and misinform clients by posing as medical clinics. The ruling gives anti-abortion centers a free speech right to potentially deceive pregnant women, despite previous defenses of free speech in other cases.
