Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Supreme Court ruled on a California law requiring anti-abortion centers to inform women about state-funded abortion services. The 5-4 decision, led by Justice Thomas, found the law likely violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. The law forces clinics to use a government-drafted script, which the challengers argue is imposing their message. Justice Kennedy concurred, calling it a threat to individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Breyer, questioned why the law is acceptable for doctors but not for counselors. The state argues the centers deceive clients by posing as medical facilities. The ruling might affect similar laws in conservative states. The author uses words like compelled, government-drafted, threat, impose, notify, abortion, require, forced, targets, deceive, misinform, etc.

Now, I'll structure the summary. Start with the ruling, mention the compelled speech aspect, the government-drafted script, the threat to free speech, the dissent's point, the state's argument about deception, and the potential consequences. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words like compelled, government-drafted, threat, impose, notify, abortion, require, forced, targets, deceive, misinform, know, gives, dress, struck, block, discriminating, put, aid.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within limits.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about state-funded abortion and contraception services likely violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. The law mandates licensed clinics to use a government-drafted script, which the challengers argue imposes the government's message, forcing them to advertise abortion services they oppose. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy, described the law as a threat to free speech, while Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, questioning why doctors can notify women about alternatives but counselors cannot inform them about abortion. California argues the law targets centers that deceive clients by posing as medical facilities, with over half of pregnancies in the state unintended. The ruling may put similar laws in conservative states at risk, potentially affecting requirements like ultrasound viewings. The court's decision highlights a conflict between compelled speech and the government's role in notifying women of their rights, while critics warn it could allow fake health centers to deceive pregnant women. END OF SUMMARY.
