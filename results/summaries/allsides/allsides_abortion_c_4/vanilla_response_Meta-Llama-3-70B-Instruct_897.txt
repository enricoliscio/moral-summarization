SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has struck down a California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, deemed the law a form of "compelled speech" that violates the First Amendment. The law forced licensed clinics to provide a government-drafted script about state-sponsored services, including abortion. The decision could have unintended consequences, potentially putting at risk laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth. The ruling was met with criticism from liberal justices and reproductive rights advocates, who argued that the law was necessary to prevent pregnancy centers from deceiving and misinforming clients.

END OF SUMMARY.
