Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Supreme Court ruling on California's law regarding anti-abortion pregnancy centers. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I have to be careful to include the key points from both sides.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against California's law, saying it violates the First Amendment because it compels speech. The law required these centers to inform women about state-funded abortion services. Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion, and Justice Kennedy concurred, talking about government imposing its message over individual speech. The dissenting justices, led by Breyer, argued that if doctors can inform about adoption, why not about abortion services. California's law also required unlicensed centers to state they're not medical facilities.

The article mentions that the ruling could affect other states' laws requiring ultrasounds or fetal information. The pro-life side, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, says it's about not forcing people to promote messages they oppose. The state's argument is that some centers mislead women, and many pregnancies are unintended, so women need accurate info. The Center for Reproductive Rights is upset, saying it allows fake centers to deceive. The Court has been balancing free speech and abortion rights, supporting free speech in recent cases. Cities like NYC and SF had similar laws, but they were often overturned on discrimination grounds.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. I should mention the Court's ruling, the compelled speech argument, the consequences for other states, the arguments from both sides (pro-life vs. state's need for accurate info), and the broader implications for free speech vs. abortion access.

I'll structure it: start with the ruling, explain the law, the Court's reasoning, the consequences, the arguments from both sides, and the broader context. Make sure to highlight the moral framing each side uses, like compelled speech vs. informed consent and deception.

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against California's law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about state-funded abortion and contraception services, deeming it a violation of the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the conservative majority, argued the law forced clinics to promote abortion, which they oppose. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, warning against government imposing its message over individual speech. Dissenting justices, led by Stephen Breyer, questioned why doctors can inform about adoption but not abortion. California's law also required unlicensed centers to disclose they are not medical facilities. Pro-life advocates argued the law infringes on free speech, while the state contended it prevents deception by centers posing as medical clinics. The ruling may affect similar laws in conservative states requiring ultrasounds or fetal information. The decision highlights the Court's balance between free speech and abortion access, with cities like New York and San Francisco facing legal challenges over similar requirements. END OF SUMMARY.
