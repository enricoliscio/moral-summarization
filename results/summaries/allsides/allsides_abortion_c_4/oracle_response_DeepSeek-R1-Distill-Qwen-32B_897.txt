Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the Supreme Court ruling on a California law regarding anti-abortion pregnancy centers. The law required these centers to inform women about state-funded abortion services. The Court ruled 5-4 against the law, saying it violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion, and Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing the threat of government imposing its message. The dissenting justices, led by Breyer, argued that the law was about informed consent and similar to other upheld laws.

I need to include as many of the listed moral words as possible. Words like "compelled," "government-drafted," "threat," "impose," "notify," "abortion," "require," "forced," "targets," "deceive," "misinform," "know," "gives," "dress," "struck," "block," "discriminating," "put," "aid" are key.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects. The majority saw the law as compelled speech, while the dissent viewed it as necessary for informed consent. The article also mentions potential consequences for other states' laws and the debate over misinformation by pregnancy centers.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main arguments and the moral language used. I'll ensure that the summary reflects the tension between free speech and informed consent, using the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to provide information about state-funded abortion and contraception services, deeming it a form of "compelled speech" under the First Amendment. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, criticized the "government-drafted script" as a "threat" to free expression, while Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a "paradigmatic example" of government imposing its message. The dissent, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, argued that the law was a "warranted" effort to "notify" women of their rights, similar to laws requiring doctors to inform patients about alternatives to abortion. Challengers, including the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, argued the law "targets" pro-life clinics and "forces" them to promote abortion, violating their convictions. California countered that many centers "deceive" and "misinform" clients by posing as medical facilities, with over half of pregnancies in the state being unintended. The ruling could "put" other state laws requiring informational postings, like those for "aid" or hygiene, on shaky legal ground. The decision reflects a broader debate over balancing free speech and the "right" to "know" versus "forcing" centers to "dress" up as medical facilities. END OF SUMMARY.
