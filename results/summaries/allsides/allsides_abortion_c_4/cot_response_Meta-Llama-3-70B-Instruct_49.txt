SUMMARY:
The Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, argues that the law "likely" violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech, forcing these centers to provide a government-drafted script about abortion services, which violates their convictions. The decision has unintended consequences, potentially putting laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth at risk. The ruling gives "fake health centers" a free speech right to deceive pregnant women, according to critics. The court's conservatives argue that the law targets only clinics that counsel women to complete their pregnancies, while liberals compare it to laws that require doctors performing abortions to advise women about alternatives.
