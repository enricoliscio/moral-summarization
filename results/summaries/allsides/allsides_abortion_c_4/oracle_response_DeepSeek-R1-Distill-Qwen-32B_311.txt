Okay, I need to summarize the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. The Supreme Court ruled on a California law requiring anti-abortion centers to inform women about state-funded abortion services. The 5-4 ruling found it likely violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion, and Kennedy concurred, calling it a threat to free speech. The law's supporters argue it's about informed consent, while opponents see it as forced advertising for abortion. The decision could affect similar laws in conservative states. Breyer dissented, questioning why doctors can inform about adoption but not about abortion services. The state claims the centers deceive clients, but the court ruled against compelled speech. The ruling upholds free speech rights but may impact other informational postings.

Now, I'll identify the morally charged words from the article: compelled, government-drafted, threat, impose, notify, abortion, require, forced, used, force, targets, warranted, deceive, misinform, know, gives, dress, struck, block, discriminating, put, aid.

I need to include these words in the summary. I'll structure the summary to cover the ruling, the reasoning, the impact, and the dissent, making sure to use the moral terms.

I'll start by stating the court's decision and its basis in compelled speech. Then mention the majority opinion and Kennedy's concurring view. Next, explain the state's perspective and the opponents' arguments. Include Breyer's dissent and the potential consequences for other laws. Conclude with the implications for free speech and informed consent.

I'll make sure each sentence uses the moral terms where appropriate, without making the summary too long. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that California's law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to provide government-drafted notices about state-funded abortion services likely violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, criticized the law for forcing pro-life clinics to promote abortion, a service they oppose. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a "paradigmatic example" of government imposing its message over individual speech. The decision could impact similar laws in conservative states requiring women to view ultrasounds or receive fetal development information. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, questioning why states can require doctors to inform women about adoption but not abortion services. California argued the law targets centers that deceive clients by posing as medical facilities, while opponents claimed it forces compelled speech on deeply divisive issues. The ruling upholds free speech rights but may put other informational postings, like first aid instructions, on shaky legal ground. END OF SUMMARY.
