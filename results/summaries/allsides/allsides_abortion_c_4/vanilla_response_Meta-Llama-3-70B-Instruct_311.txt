SUMMARY:

The US Supreme Court has struck down a California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, deemed the law a violation of the First Amendment, as it forced centers to promote a message against their beliefs. The law required licensed clinics to post notices about free or low-cost state programs, including abortion services, and unlicensed centers to inform clients they were not medical facilities. The court's conservatives argued that the law targeted pro-life centers, while liberal justices compared it to laws requiring doctors to advise women about alternatives to abortion. The ruling may have unintended consequences, potentially putting at risk laws in conservative states that require women seeking abortions to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth.

END OF SUMMARY.
