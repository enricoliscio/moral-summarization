SUMMARY:

In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court struck down a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services, citing First Amendment violations. The court's conservatives argued that the law forces centers to promote a message that goes against their convictions, while liberal justices countered that it's similar to laws requiring doctors to inform women about alternatives to abortion. The decision may have unintended consequences, potentially putting laws in conservative states that require women to view ultrasounds or learn about fetal growth at risk. Pro-life advocates hailed the decision, saying it protects freedom of speech and prevents compelled speech, while reproductive rights groups decried it, arguing that it allows "fake health centers" to deceive pregnant women. The ruling highlights the ongoing debate over abortion and free speech rights.
