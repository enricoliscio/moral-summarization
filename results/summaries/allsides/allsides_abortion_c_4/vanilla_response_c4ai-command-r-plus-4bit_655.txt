SUMMARY: The Supreme Court dealt a blow to a California law that required anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling, led by Justice Clarence Thomas, stated that the law likely violates the First Amendment as a form of compelled speech. The decision was aimed at a liberal state government seeking to notify pregnant women of their abortion rights but could have unintended consequences for similar laws in conservative states. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates argued that such "informed consent" laws are only warranted on the verge of a medical procedure. Challengers of the law saw it as a form of compelled speech, forcing pregnancy centers to advertise abortion services against their beliefs. The court's conservatives complained that the law unfairly targets anti-abortion clinics, while liberal justices compared it to informed consent laws for doctors performing abortions. The ruling gives pregnancy centers a free speech right to provide misleading information to pregnant women, according to critics.
