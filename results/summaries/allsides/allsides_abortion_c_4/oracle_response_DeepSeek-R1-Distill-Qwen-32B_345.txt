Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The article is about the Supreme Court ruling on a California law related to anti-abortion pregnancy centers. The author used specific morally charged words like "compelled," "government-drafted," "threat," etc. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against California's law, which required these centers to inform women about abortion services. The majority, led by Justice Thomas, said it violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. They argue the law forces the centers to promote something they oppose. 

Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion emphasized the threat of government imposing its message over individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Breyer, questioned why the state couldn't inform women about their options, similar to how doctors inform about alternatives. California's law also required unlicensed centers to state they're not medical facilities, which the challengers saw as compelled speech.

The article mentions that this ruling might affect laws in conservative states requiring ultrasounds or fetal information. The state's argument was that many centers deceive women by posing as medical clinics, especially since many pregnancies are unintended. The court has previously upheld informed consent laws for medical procedures but this case is different because it's about counseling to continue pregnancy.

I need to include the morally framed words as much as possible. Words like "compelled," "government-drafted," "threat," "impose," "notify," "abortion," "require," "forced," "targets," "warranted," "deceive," "misinform," "know," "gives," "dress," "struck," "block," "discriminating," "put," "aid."

So, the summary should mention the court's ruling against California's law, the compelled speech argument, the threat of government imposing messages, the requirement to notify about abortion services, the targeting of pro-life centers, the state's contention about deception, and the potential consequences for other laws.

I should structure it to include these elements concisely, making sure to preserve the moral framing. Let me try to draft that.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against California's law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about state-funded abortion services, deeming it "compelled speech" under the First Amendment. Justice Clarence Thomas led the majority, stating the law forces centers to promote abortion, which they oppose. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a "paradigmatic threat" of government imposing its message. The dissent, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, questioned why the state couldn't notify women about their options, as doctors do. California argued many centers "deceive" women by posing as medical clinics, given high unintended pregnancies. The ruling may affect laws in conservative states requiring ultrasounds or fetal information. The court has upheld informed consent in medical procedures but this case targets counseling to continue pregnancy. The decision could "put" other required postings, like first aid, on shaky ground. END OF SUMMARY.
