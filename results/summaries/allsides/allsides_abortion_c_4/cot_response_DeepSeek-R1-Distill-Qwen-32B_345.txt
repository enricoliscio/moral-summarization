Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about a Supreme Court decision regarding a California law. They also want me to identify morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those moral frames. 

First, I need to read the article carefully. The key points are that the Supreme Court ruled against California's law requiring anti-abortion centers to inform women about abortion services. The majority opinion said it violates the First Amendment as compelled speech. Justice Thomas wrote the opinion, and Justice Kennedy concurred, emphasizing government imposing its message. The dissenting justices, led by Breyer, argued that the law is similar to other informed consent requirements. California's law also required unlicensed centers to state they're not medical facilities. Challengers argued it's forcing speech against their beliefs. The ruling could affect other states' laws requiring ultrasounds or fetal information. The state contended that many centers mislead women, and the decision could impact other required postings like health information.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words with moral framing. Let me go through the article again and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "blow," "anti-abortion," "compelled speech," "oppose," "deceive," "convictions," "advertising," "deceive," "fake," "deceive," "discriminating," "deceive," "deceive," "deceive." These words carry moral weight because they relate to freedom, deception, rights, and discrimination.

Next, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these moral words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I should start by stating the ruling, mention the compelled speech argument, the consequences, the state's position, the dissent, and the implications. I'll make sure to include the moral terms to preserve the author's framing.

Putting it all together, the summary should clearly outline the court's decision, the moral arguments on both sides, and the potential impacts. I need to keep it concise but comprehensive, ensuring all key points are covered while preserving the moral language.

**SUMMARY:**

The Supreme Court ruled against a California law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services, deeming it a form of "compelled speech" that violates the First Amendment. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the conservative majority, criticized the law for forcing pro-life centers to promote abortion services they oppose. Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred, calling it a "paradigmatic example" of government imposing its message over individual speech. The dissent, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, argued that the law was similar to upheld informed-consent requirements for doctors. California contended that many pregnancy centers deceive women by posing as medical clinics, while challengers argued the law forces speech against their convictions. The ruling could impact laws in conservative states requiring ultrasounds or fetal information, and opponents warned it could weaken other public health postings. The decision highlights tensions between free speech rights and the obligation to provide accurate information.
