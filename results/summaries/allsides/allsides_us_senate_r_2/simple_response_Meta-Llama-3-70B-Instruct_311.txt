SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, refusing to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and instead taking a more deliberative approach. Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson remained calm and measured in his responses. While Tillerson wouldn't categorize Putin as a "war criminal," he did take a harder line towards Russia than President-elect Trump has, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it poses a danger to the US. Tillerson also addressed other global issues, including China's illegal building of man-made islands and the threat of radical Islam. Throughout the hearing, Tillerson emphasized the importance of a strong US leadership and a clear-eyed approach to dealing with other cultures.
