SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, refusing to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and instead taking a more deliberative approach. Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy towards Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson remained calm and measured in his responses. While Tillerson wouldn't categorize Putin as a murderer or Saudi Arabia as a human rights violator, he did take a harder line towards Russia than President-elect Trump, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and acknowledging its danger to NATO allies. Tillerson also addressed China's illegal island-building, radical Islam, and the need for the US to focus on defeating ISIS in Syria. Throughout the hearing, Tillerson emphasized his commitment to serving American interests and his "clear-eyed and realistic" approach to dealing with other cultures. His testimony was marked by a sense of gravitas and a willingness to take a nuanced view of complex global issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
