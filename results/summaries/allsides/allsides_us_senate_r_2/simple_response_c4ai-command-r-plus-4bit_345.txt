SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson was grilled by senators, including Sen. Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing. Rubio pressed Tillerson on his stance towards Russia, specifically whether he would label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson refused to do so but took a harder line on Russia than President-elect Trump, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary." He also acknowledged Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and criticized the Obama administration's response. Tillerson's testimony covered other topics, including China's island-building in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and the need to focus on defeating ISIS. He called cyber intrusions the greatest threat facing the U.S. and pledged to serve the interests of the American people. Tillerson's hearing was marked by protests and exchanges with Rubio over his stance on Russia and other issues. Rubio tried to get Tillerson to condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines but Tillerson remained deliberative. Rubio expressed concern about Tillerson's worldview but Tillerson assured him that he was "clear-eyed and realistic."
END OF SUMMARY.
