SUMMARY: At his Senate confirmation hearing, Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Senator Marco Rubio over Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson refused, instead calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary." Tillerson also took a harder line on Russia than President-elect Trump, stating that Russia poses a danger and that NATO allies are right to be alarmed. He addressed other issues such as China's island-building in the South China Sea and radical Islam, and criticized the Obama administration's foreign policy. Tillerson also faced questions about ExxonMobil's climate change policies and Trump's use of Twitter. The hearing was interrupted by protesters, including Code Pink activists and people dressed as T-Rex dinosaurs, alluding to Tillerson's name. Rubio expressed concern about Tillerson's ability to lead U.S. foreign policy, but Tillerson assured him that he sees the world through a realistic lens. 

END OF SUMMARY.
