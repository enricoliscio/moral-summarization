Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a news summary with a moral framing. They provided a detailed news article about Rex Tillerson's confirmation hearing. The user has specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, then write a summary preserving those words.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words mean. These are words that carry a strong moral judgment, like "war criminal," "human rights violator," or "stumbled." They convey approval or disapproval.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each paragraph and pick out words that have a moral connotation. Words like "incredulous," "pressing," "brand," "broadside," "deliberative," "cross-examined," "aggressive," "allege," "meddling," "controversial," "murdered," "enemies," "danger," "unpredictable," "unfriendly," "adversary," "illegally," "grave risk," "competing goals," "stumbled," "confusion," "danger," "levity," "stumbling," "choice," "protesters," "ejected," "screamed," "reject," "costumes," "play," "name," "filled," "activists," "outfitted," "costumes," "play," "name."

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these moral words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should capture the key points: the clash between Tillerson and Rubio, Tillerson's stance on Russia, his comments on other countries, and the hearing's atmosphere.

I should structure the summary to include the main events, Tillerson's responses, and the moral implications discussed. I'll need to keep it concise, around 200 words, and ensure that the moral framing is preserved.

I think I've got all the steps down. Now, I'll proceed to list the morally framed words and then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
During Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson's confirmation hearing, Sen. Marco Rubio clashed with Tillerson over Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson declined, emphasizing a more deliberative approach. Tillerson described Russia as an "unfriendly adversary" and criticized its annexation of Crimea, calling it "illegal." He also criticized the Obama administration for not providing enough support to Ukraine. Tillerson took a harder line on Russia than President-elect Trump but stopped short of calling it an enemy. He addressed other issues, including China's "illegal" island-building in the South China Sea and the threat of ISIS. Tillerson also faced questions about ExxonMobil's climate policies and Trump's use of Twitter. The hearing was marked by tension, with protesters, including Code Pink activists and "T-Rex" costumes, disrupting the proceedings. Tillerson emphasized the need for U.S. leadership to avoid global confusion and danger.
