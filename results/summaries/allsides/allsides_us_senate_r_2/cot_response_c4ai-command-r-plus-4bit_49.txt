SUMMARY: An incredulous Senator Marco Rubio cross-examined Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson on Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines during a contentious Senate confirmation hearing. Rubio pressed Tillerson to brand Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson refused, instead calling Russia an "adversary" and taking a harder line on Russian aggression. Tillerson also blunted Rubio's broadsides on Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, refusing to categorize Saudi Arabia as a human rights violator or denounce the controversial Duterte regime. He expressed concerns about the dangers posed by Russia and radical Islam but stopped short of calling Putin a murderer, as Rubio suggested. Tillerson's patriotism and business ties to Russia were also discussed, with Tillerson insisting he would serve the interests of the American people. He further acknowledged the threat of cyber intrusions and the illegal actions of China in the South China Sea. The hearing was marked by moments of levity and contemptuous exchanges, with Tillerson at times stumbling over questions.
END OF SUMMARY.
