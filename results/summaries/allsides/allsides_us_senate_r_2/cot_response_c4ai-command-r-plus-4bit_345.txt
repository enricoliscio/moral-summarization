SUMMARY:
Sen. Marco Rubio and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed during a contentious hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson on his stance towards Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio, incredulous, tried to get Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson refused, citing his realistic and deliberative vision of dealing with different cultures. Rubio, in a broadside, also tried to get Tillerson to acknowledge Saudi Arabia as a "human rights violator" and denounce the practices of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Rubio's aggressive line of questioning seemed to stem from concerns about Tillerson's ability to see the world through a moral lens. Tillerson, however, maintained that he is clear-eyed and realistic, refusing to bite on Rubio's attempts to get him to condemn Putin as a murderer of political foes. Tillerson took a harder line on Putin and Russia, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and acknowledging the danger posed by a resurgent Russia. He criticized the Obama administration's weak response to Russia's illegitimate taking of Crimea and their illegal actions in the South China Sea. Tillerson also highlighted the imminent threat of radical Islam and cyber intrusions, stating that the US has stumbled under the current administration and risks plunging the world into confusion and danger. One protester at the hearing screamed, "I reject you!" at Tillerson, reflecting the moral framing of the hearing.
