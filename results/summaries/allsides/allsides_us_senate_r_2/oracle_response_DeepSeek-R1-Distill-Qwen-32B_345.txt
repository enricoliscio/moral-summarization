Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rex Tillerson's Senate hearing, preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Tillerson's clash with Rubio, where Rubio pressed him on labeling Putin a war criminal. Tillerson didn't bite, which frustrated Rubio. Tillerson emphasized a realistic approach to dealing with different cultures. He called Russia an "unfriendly adversary" but stopped short of calling it an enemy. He criticized Russia's annexation of Crimea and the lack of a strong response from the Obama administration. He also addressed other issues like China's activities in the South China Sea, ISIS, and Syria. Tillerson was cautious about Trump's Twitter use and made some light-hearted remarks about Exxon's climate policies.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally framed words: poses, advancing, serve, taking, absence, response, building, risk, defeating, threat, intrusions, stumbled, plunging, ejected.

I should structure the summary to cover the main exchanges, Tillerson's stance on Russia, his criticism of the previous administration, and other foreign policy points. I'll need to weave in those words naturally.

Let me start by outlining the key points:

1. Clash between Tillerson and Rubio over labeling Putin a war criminal.
2. Tillerson's approach to diplomacy, focusing on realistic and cultural understanding.
3. Tillerson's criticism of Russia's actions in Crimea and the weak response from the US.
4. Tillerson's view on Russia as an unfriendly adversary.
5. Addressing China's island building, radical Islam, Syria, and ISIS.
6. Tillerson's take on cyber threats and the stumble under Obama.
7. Light moment with Kaine and a mention of protesters.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the moral words and keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio over labeling Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson declined to do so, emphasizing a realistic approach to diplomacy. He called Russia an "unfriendly adversary," criticizing its "taking" of Crimea and the "absence" of a strong U.S. "response." Tillerson also criticized China's "illegal" island "building" in the South China Sea and warned of radical Islam's "grave risk" to global stability. He stated that ISIS posed an "imminent threat" but identified cyber "intrusions" as the "greatest" threat to the U.S. Tillerson acknowledged the Obama administration had "stumbled" and warned against "plunging" the world into chaos without U.S. leadership. He avoided addressing Trump's Twitter use, saying it was up to the president. The hearing saw "ejected" protesters, including Code Pink activists. Tillerson's cautious tone stood out compared to Trump's approach. END OF SUMMARY.
