Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Rex Tillerson's Senate confirmation hearing. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

Okay, the article talks about a clash between Tillerson and Sen. Rubio. Rubio was pressing Tillerson to label Putin as a "war criminal," but Tillerson didn't take the bait. Instead, he explained his more deliberate approach. They discussed Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Tillerson emphasized that he sees the world realistically and doesn't have a different perspective. He criticized Russia's actions in Crimea, saying it was a taking of territory without legal claim. He also mentioned the Obama administration's failure to respond strongly, which Russia saw as weakness.

Tillerson also addressed other issues like China's island-building in the South China Sea and radical Islam as a threat. He talked about Syria, pointing out the conflicting goals of removing Assad and fighting ISIS. He called cyber intrusions the biggest threat and admitted the government stumbled under Obama. There was a lighter moment with Sen. Kaine asking about Exxon's climate policies, and Tillerson's humorous response.

He also mentioned not advising Trump on Twitter use and the protests during the hearing. 

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the clash with Rubio, Tillerson's refusal to label Putin, his criticism of Russia's actions, his stance on other issues like China and Syria, the humorous moment, and the protests. I should make sure it's concise and covers all main aspects without going into too much detail.
