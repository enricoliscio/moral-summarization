SUMMARY: Rex Tillerson, nominee for Secretary of State, clashed with Senator Marco Rubio during a confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson on his stance towards Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio tried to get Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and denounce the practices of the Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte and Saudi Arabia's human rights violations. Tillerson refused to use such labels but took a harder line towards Russia, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and criticizing the Obama administration's response to Russia's taking of Crimea. He also addressed other threats, including China's illegal building in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and cyber intrusions, stating that the US risked plunging the world into confusion and danger if it did not lead. Tillerson's hearing was marked by protests and contentious exchanges, with Rubio expressing concern about Tillerson's moral lens and Tillerson defending his realistic approach to diplomacy.

END OF SUMMARY.
