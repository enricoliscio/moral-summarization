SUMMARY:
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, refusing to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Rubio pressed Tillerson to take a stronger stance against Putin, but Tillerson maintained a more deliberative approach. Tillerson did, however, call Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stated that it poses a "danger" to the US. He also criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, calling it a "weak response". Tillerson took a harder line on other issues, including China's "illegal" building of man-made islands and the "grave risk" posed by radical Islam. He also emphasized the need for the US to take a stronger leadership role, warning that "if we do not lead, we risk plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger". END OF SUMMARY.
