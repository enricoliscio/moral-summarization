SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson refused, citing a more deliberative approach. Rubio also questioned Tillerson on policy regarding Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, with Tillerson taking a harder line towards Putin and Russia than President-elect Trump. Tillerson called Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stated that Russia's taking of Crimea was illegal. He also expressed concerns about China's "illegal" building of man-made islands in the South China Sea and radical Islam posing a "grave risk" to nations. Tillerson emphasized the need to focus on defeating ISIS and addressed cyber intrusions as the "greatest and most complex threat" facing the U.S. He warned that if the U.S. does not lead, it risks "plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger." Throughout the hearing, Tillerson's responses were marked by a sense of realism and a commitment to serving the American people.
