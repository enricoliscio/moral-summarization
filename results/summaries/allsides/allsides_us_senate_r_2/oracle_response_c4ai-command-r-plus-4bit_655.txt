SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Senator Marco Rubio clashed during a heated confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson refused, but took a harder line on Russia, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and asserting that Russia poses a danger to U.S. interests. He also stated that Russia's taking of Crimea was illegal and criticized the absence of a forceful response from the Obama administration. Tillerson addressed other global threats, including China's illegal building of islands in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and cyber intrusions. He stumbled when asked about ExxonMobil's climate change policies, saying he lacked knowledge and refused to answer. Tillerson also pledged to serve the interests of the American people and lead in global affairs, warning that a failure to do so could plunge the world into confusion and danger. The hearing was marked by protests, including disruptions by Code Pink activists and protesters dressed as T-Rex dinosaurs, playing on Tillerson's name. One protester was ejected after shouting her rejection of Tillerson.
END OF SUMMARY.
