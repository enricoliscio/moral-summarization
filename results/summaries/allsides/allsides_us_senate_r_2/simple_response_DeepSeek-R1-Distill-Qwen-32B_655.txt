Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rex Tillerson's Senate hearing. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the key points where Tillerson's stance on Russia, his interactions with Rubio, and his overall approach were highlighted.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main events. Tillerson clashed with Rubio over labeling Putin a war criminal. Rubio pressed him hard, but Tillerson maintained a more measured approach. He emphasized his realistic view on dealing with other cultures and countries.

Next, Tillerson's statements about Russia being an unfriendly adversary but not an enemy stand out. He criticized the Obama administration's handling of Crimea and Ukraine. He also addressed other issues like China's activities in the South China Sea and ISIS.

I should note the moral framing here. The author presents Tillerson as cautious and realistic, which contrasts with Rubio's more confrontational approach. Tillerson's refusal to label Putin a war criminal shows his diplomatic prudence, but it's also seen as a departure from Trump's stance.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll highlight the clash with Rubio, Tillerson's cautious language, his criticism of Russia, and his broader foreign policy points. Also, mention the lighter moment with Sen. Kaine and Tillerson's comment about Trump's Twitter use.

Finally, wrap it up by noting the protesters and the overall tone of the hearing. Make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced a heated exchange with Sen. Marco Rubio during his Senate confirmation hearing, as Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson avoided the term, emphasizing a "realistic" approach to international relations. While he called Russia an "unfriendly adversary," he stopped short of declaring it an enemy. Tillerson criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, stating it was a "taking of territory that was not theirs." He also addressed other issues, including China's island-building in the South China Sea and the threat of ISIS, while cautioning against the U.S. government's past "stumbling." Tillerson's measured tone contrasted with Rubio's aggressive questioning, and he sought to clarify that he shared senators' concerns but viewed the world through a "different lens." The hearing also included a lighter moment when Tillerson humorously dodged a question about ExxonMobil's climate policies. Tillerson's cautious approach to diplomacy stood out as a potential departure from President-elect Trump's more confrontational style. END OF SUMMARY.
