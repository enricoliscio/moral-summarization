Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral terms used. The article is about Rex Tillerson's Senate confirmation hearing, where he clashed with Sen. Rubio. The user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included in the summary.

I should start by identifying the main events: the clash between Tillerson and Rubio, the topics they discussed like Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Tillerson's refusal to label Putin as a "war criminal" is a key point. I need to use the words like "poses," "advancing," "serve," etc., as per the author's framing.

Next, I should note Tillerson's statements about Russia being an "unfriendly adversary" and his criticism of the Obama administration's response to Crimea. Also, his comments on China's activities in the South China Sea and ISIS are important. I need to make sure to include terms like "risk," "defeating," and "threat."

I also need to include the lighter moment with Sen. Kaine and Tillerson's response about Exxon's climate policies, using "stumbled" and "plunging." Lastly, the protesters at the hearing should be mentioned with "ejected."

I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all the moral terms. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, highlighting the key exchanges and Tillerson's positions without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced a contentious Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, where Sen. Marco Rubio pressed him on foreign policy issues, including Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio sought to get Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson declined, emphasizing a more deliberative approach. Tillerson described Russia as an "unfriendly adversary" and criticized the Obama administration's "absence of a very firm, forceful response" to Russia's "taking" of Crimea. He also criticized China's "illegal" island-building in the South China Sea and called ISIS an "imminent threat," while labeling cyber intrusions as the "greatest and most complex threat" to the U.S. Tillerson acknowledged the Obama administration had "stumbled" and warned of the risks of not leading on the global stage. A lighter moment occurred when Tillerson humorously dodged a question about ExxonMobil's climate policies. Protesters, including those dressed as a T-Rex referencing Tillerson's name, were present, with one ejected for disruptive behavior. END OF SUMMARY.
