Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rex Tillerson's Senate hearing. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the key points and the tone.

The article talks about the clash between Tillerson and Rubio, with Rubio pressing Tillerson on labeling Putin as a war criminal. Tillerson didn't go along with that, which seems to be a point of contention. There's a moral aspect here because Rubio is pushing for a strong stance against Russia, while Tillerson is more measured.

I should note the main topics: Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines. Tillerson's stance on each, especially Russia, is important. He called Russia an "unfriendly adversary" but didn't label it an enemy. That's a moderate position compared to Trump's previous statements.

Also, there's the issue of Tillerson's business ties with Russia and the questions about Exxon's policies. The moral framing might involve questions about his impartiality and loyalty to the U.S.

Rubio's aggressive questioning and Tillerson's measured responses highlight a contrast in approaches. Tillerson emphasized the need for a firm response to Russia's actions in Crimea, which shows a concern for international law and U.S. leadership.

I should also mention the lighter moment with Senator Kaine and Tillerson's response about Exxon's climate policies, as it adds a touch of the hearing's atmosphere.

Lastly, the protesters and the overall tense atmosphere in the hearing room set the scene, showing public concern about Tillerson's nomination.

Putting it all together, the summary needs to capture the key exchanges, Tillerson's measured approach, the moral implications of his stance on Russia and other countries, and the overall tone of the hearing. I'll make sure to keep it under 200 words and preserve the moral framing by highlighting the ethical considerations in his responses.

SUMMARY:  
During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing, Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced intense questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio, who pressed him on U.S. policy toward Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio sought to get Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and Saudi Arabia a "human rights violator," but Tillerson avoided such categorical statements, emphasizing a more measured approach to diplomacy. Tillerson described Russia as an "unfriendly adversary" and criticized its annexation of Crimea, while also acknowledging the complexity of international relations. He criticized the Obama administration's handling of Ukraine and called for a firmer response to Russia's actions. Tillerson also addressed China's activities in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and Syria, where he argued the U.S. should prioritize defeating ISIS over ousting President Bashar al-Assad. He labeled cyber threats as the "greatest and most complex threat" to the U.S. Tillerson's testimony was marked by a contrast between Rubio's aggressive questioning and Tillerson's deliberate, realistic approach to foreign policy. The hearing also saw lighter moments, including a humorous exchange about ExxonMobil's climate policies and a mention of President-elect Trump's use of Twitter. The session was attended by protesters, adding to the tense atmosphere.
