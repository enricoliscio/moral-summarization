SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, refusing to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and instead taking a more deliberative approach. Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson maintained a calm demeanor. While Tillerson wouldn't categorize Putin as a war criminal, he did take a harder line towards Russia than President-elect Trump, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it poses a danger to the US. Tillerson also addressed other areas, including China's actions in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and Syria, where he advocated for a focus on defeating ISIS. The hearing was marked by tense exchanges and occasional levity, including a humorous moment when Tillerson dodged a question about ExxonMobil's climate change policies.
