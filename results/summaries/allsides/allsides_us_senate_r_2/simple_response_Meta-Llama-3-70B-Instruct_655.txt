SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced a contentious confirmation hearing, particularly with Sen. Marco Rubio, who pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson refused, citing a more deliberative approach. Rubio also questioned Tillerson on human rights violators, including Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. Despite not meeting Rubio's expectations, Tillerson took a harder line on Russia than President-elect Trump, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that the Obama administration should have provided Ukraine with help defending its borders. Tillerson also addressed other areas, including China's illegal building of man-made islands and the threat of radical Islam. Throughout the hearing, Tillerson emphasized the importance of American leadership and a clear-eyed approach to dealing with cultures. The hearing was marked by tense exchanges and protests from the audience.
