SUMMARY:
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Senator Marco Rubio clashed during a contentious exchange, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Tillerson refused, citing his clear-eyed and realistic approach to dealing with different cultures. He did, however, acknowledge Russia as an "unfriendly adversary" and took a harder line on Russia's actions in Crimea. Tillerson also addressed other global concerns, including China's illegal activities in the South China Sea and the threat of radical Islam. He deemed cyber intrusions the "greatest and most complex threat" facing the U.S. and noted that the country had "stumbled" under the Obama administration, risking plunging the world into confusion and greater danger. Rubio's aggressive and incredulous line of questioning seemed aimed at exposing Tillerson's potential moral blind spots regarding human rights violations and political murders committed by adversarial nations. Tillerson, meanwhile, maintained his composure and emphasized his patriotism and commitment to serving the interests of the American people. END OF SUMMARY.
