Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing from the original text. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and follow a specific format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main focus is the Senate confirmation hearing for Rex Tillerson, where he faced tough questions from Sen. Marco Rubio. The moral aspects involve how Tillerson's approach to international relations is being evaluated, especially regarding Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines.

I should highlight the clash between Tillerson and Rubio, emphasizing the moral issues like calling Putin a war criminal and human rights violations. It's important to note Tillerson's measured responses and his stance on Russia as an adversary but not an enemy. Also, the article touches on Tillerson's business ties and his criticisms of the Obama administration, which are moral considerations in his suitability for the role.

I need to keep the summary within 200 words, so I'll focus on the main exchanges and Tillerson's key statements. I'll make sure to include his position on Crimea, his criticism of the previous administration's response, and his views on other global issues like China and ISIS.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to reflect the moral framing, showing the tension between Rubio's direct questioning and Tillerson's more diplomatic approach. I'll ensure the summary is clear, concise, and adheres to the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced intense questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio during his Senate confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and denounce human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. Tillerson, while not explicitly calling Putin a war criminal, took a firm stance on Russia, describing it as an "unfriendly adversary" and criticizing its actions in Crimea. He also criticized the Obama administration's handling of Ukraine and Russia's aggression. Tillerson emphasized the need for a strong, realistic approach to international relations, stating that Russia's actions posed a danger but were predictable. He also addressed other global issues, including China's activities in the South China Sea, ISIS, and cyber threats, which he called the "greatest and most complex threat" to the U.S. Tillerson's measured responses contrasted with Rubio's aggressive questioning, and he sought to clarify that his approach was not fundamentally different from others but rooted in cultural understanding. The hearing also included lighter moments, such as Tillerson's humorous response about ExxonMobil's climate policies. Tillerson's testimony highlighted a balance between firmness and diplomacy in U.S. foreign policy.
