Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what moral framing means. It refers to the words or phrases that carry a moral judgment or evaluation. 

Looking at the article, I should go through it and identify all the single words that are morally framed. These could be words like "war criminal," "aggressive," "discouraging," etc. I'll list each of these words, each on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and capture the key points, such as the clash between Tillerson and Rubio, Tillerson's stance on Russia, and other foreign policy issues discussed.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral aspects, like Rubio's accusations and Tillerson's cautious responses, while also touching on other topics like China, Syria, and climate change. I'll make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit.

Finally, I'll present the identified words and the summary as per the user's instructions, ensuring clarity and adherence to the format specified.

**SUMMARY:**  
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced intense questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and to condemn Russia's actions. Tillerson, while taking a harder line on Russia than President-elect Trump, refused to use the term "war criminal," stating he viewed the world through a "deliberative vision." Tillerson criticized Russia's annexation of Crimea, calling it "illegal," and emphasized the need for a firm response. He also addressed China's "illegal" island-building in the South China Sea and the threat posed by ISIS, while downplaying Trump's Twitter use. Tillerson's hearing saw moral framing around issues like human rights, aggression, and leadership, with protesters expressing strong opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
