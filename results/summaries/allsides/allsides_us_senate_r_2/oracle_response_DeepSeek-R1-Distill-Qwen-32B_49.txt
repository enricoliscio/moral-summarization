Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should focus on using the morally framed words provided. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about Rex Tillerson's Senate confirmation hearing. The main conflict is between Tillerson and Senator Rubio, who is pushing him to label Putin as a "war criminal." Tillerson avoids that label but still takes a firm stance against Russia. The author uses words like "poses," "advancing," "serve," "taking," "absence," "response," "building," "risk," "defeating," "threat," "intrusions," "stumbled," "plunging," and "ejected." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key exchanges between Tillerson and Rubio, focusing on the moral implications of their arguments. Tillerson's refusal to call Putin a war criminal is a point of contention, but he still portrays Russia as a threat. I'll also mention his criticism of the Obama administration's handling of Crimea and his stance on other issues like China and ISIS.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral framing without getting bogged down in details. I'll start by outlining the main points: the clash with Rubio, Tillerson's cautious approach, his statements on Russia, Crimea, and other foreign policy issues, and the lighter moment with Senator Kaine.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and maintain the structure. I should avoid any markdown and keep it natural. Let me check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Once done, I'll present it clearly after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together.

SUMMARY: During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing, Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio over foreign policy, particularly regarding Russia. Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson avoided the term, emphasizing a more deliberative approach. Tillerson described Russia as an "unfriendly adversary" and criticized its actions in Crimea, calling the annexation "a taking of territory that was not theirs." He also criticized the Obama administration for its weak response to Russia's actions. Tillerson addressed other issues, including China's "illegal" island-building in the South China Sea, the threat of ISIS, and the risks posed by radical Islam. He acknowledged the U.S. government's shortcomings under the Obama administration, stating that without American leadership, the world could "plunge deeper into confusion and danger." Tillerson also faced questions about ExxonMobil's climate policies and Trump's use of Twitter, avoiding direct criticism of Trump's communication style. The hearing was marked by tense exchanges and a few moments of levity, including a protester ejected for shouting "I reject you!" at Tillerson. END OF SUMMARY.
