SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, where Rubio pressed Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Tillerson refused, citing a more deliberative approach. Rubio also questioned Tillerson on policy regarding Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson maintained a measured tone. Tillerson did take a harder line towards Russia, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it "poses a danger" to the US and its NATO allies. He also criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's "taking" of Crimea, calling it a "weak response". Tillerson emphasized the need for the US to "serve" its own interests and "defeat" ISIS, while also addressing other global threats, including China's "illegal" building in the South China Sea and cyber "intrusions". Throughout the hearing, Tillerson's calm demeanor contrasted with Rubio's aggressive questioning, with Tillerson seeking to "allay" concerns and promote a more nuanced approach to international relations.
