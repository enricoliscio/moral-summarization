SUMMARY:
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, refusing to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson took a more deliberative approach. Tillerson called Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and said it poses a "danger" to the US, but stopped short of saying it's an "enemy". He also took aim at China's "illegal" building of man-made islands in the South China Sea and radical Islam, which poses a "grave risk" to nations. Tillerson testified that the US needs to focus on defeating ISIS and lead globally to avoid "confusion" and "danger". The hearing was marked by tense exchanges and protests from the audience.
