SUMMARY: Rex Tillerson, nominee for Secretary of State, faced a contentious hearing with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. Senator Marco Rubio pressed Tillerson on his views regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pushed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson refused, instead referring to Russia as an "unfriendly adversary." Tillerson also took a hard line on Russia's annexation of Crimea and criticized the Obama administration's response. He addressed other global issues, including China's activities in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and the conflict in Syria. Tillerson identified cyber intrusions as the greatest threat facing the U.S. and expressed concern about global confusion and danger if America does not take a leadership role. The hearing was interrupted by protesters, including some dressed as T-Rex dinosaurs playing on Tillerson's name. Tillerson also faced questions about ExxonMobil's climate change policies and Trump's use of Twitter, to which he responded that it was the President-elect's choice how to communicate. 
END OF SUMMARY.
