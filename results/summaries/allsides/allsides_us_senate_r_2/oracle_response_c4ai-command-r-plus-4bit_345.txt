SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Marco Rubio clashed during a contentious hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson refused, citing his clear-eyed and realistic approach to dealing with different cultures. The exchange mirrored Rubio's attempts to get Tillerson to condemn other nations, such as Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, for human rights violations. Tillerson took a harder line on Putin and Russia, calling them an "unfriendly adversary" and criticizing the Obama administration's response to Russia's "taking" of Crimea. He also addressed other global challenges, including China's illegal building in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and the need to focus on defeating ISIS. Tillerson identified cyber intrusions as the greatest threat facing the U.S. and lamented that the U.S. had "stumbled" in its leadership role under Obama, risking plunging the world into confusion and danger. One notable moment was when Tillerson declined to answer questions about ExxonMobil's climate change policies, stating he lacked knowledge and refused to answer. The hearing was marked by protests and interruptions, reflecting the contentious nature of Tillerson's nomination.
END OF SUMMARY.
