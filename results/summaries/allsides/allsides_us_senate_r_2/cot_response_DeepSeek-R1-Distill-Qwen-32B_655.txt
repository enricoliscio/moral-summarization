Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rex Tillerson's confirmation hearing. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "war criminal," "incredulous," "aggressive," "allege," "meddling," "unfriendly," "illegal," "grave risk," "imminent threat," "confusion," "danger," "weak," "stumbled," "dictate," "love," "patriotism," "right," "alarm," "resurgent," "controversial," "murder," "help," "defend," "fear," "opponent," "expect," "expectation," "expectant," "expecting," "expectation," "expectant," "expecting," "expectation," "expectant," "expecting," "expectation," "expectant," "expecting," "expectation," "expectant," "expecting," "expectation," "expectant," "expecting," "expectation,"
