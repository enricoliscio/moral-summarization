SUMMARY:
 Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and Tillerson refusing to do so. Rubio found Tillerson's response "discouraging" and tried to get him to categorize Saudi Arabia as a "human rights violator" and denounce the practices of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Tillerson took a harder line towards Putin and Russia, calling them an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that Russia poses a "danger" to the US. He also addressed other areas, including China's "illegal" building of man-made islands and the "grave risk" posed by radical Islam. Tillerson emphasized the need for a strong US leadership to prevent the world from plunging into "confusion and danger." END OF SUMMARY.
