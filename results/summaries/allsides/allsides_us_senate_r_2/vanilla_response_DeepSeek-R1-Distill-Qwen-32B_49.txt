Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Rex Tillerson's Senate confirmation hearing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

The article talks about a heated exchange between Tillerson and Sen. Rubio. Rubio wanted Tillerson to label Putin as a "war criminal," but Tillerson didn't take the bait. Instead, he emphasized his realistic approach to dealing with different cultures. There's also mention of other topics like Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Tillerson's stance on Russia as an "unfriendly adversary." 

I should note the main points: the clash with Rubio, Tillerson's refusal to label Putin, his views on Russia's actions in Crimea, his comments on China and ISIS, and some lighter moments with other senators. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most significant exchanges and his policy positions. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the key confrontations and Tillerson's responses. Also, include his stance on Russia's actions and his broader foreign policy views. Make sure to mention the lighter moment with Sen. Kaine for a balanced summary. 

Let me make sure I cover all important aspects without going into too much detail. I'll start with the clash with Rubio, then move on to his statements about Russia, other foreign policy points, and end with the lighter moment. That should cover the main events succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced a heated exchange with Sen. Marco Rubio during his Senate confirmation hearing. Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson declined, emphasizing a realistic approach to international relations. Tillerson also avoided categorizing Saudi Arabia as a "human rights violator" or denouncing Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's policies. While he took a tougher stance on Russia than President-elect Trump, he stopped short of calling it an enemy. Tillerson criticized Russia's annexation of Crimea and the Obama administration's weak response, calling it "a taking of territory that was not theirs." He also addressed China's South China Sea activities, radical Islam, and Syria, stating the U.S. should prioritize defeating ISIS. Tillerson acknowledged the Obama administration's missteps and warned of global instability without U.S. leadership. A lighter moment occurred when he humorously dodged a question about ExxonMobil's climate policies. Tillerson also declined to comment on Trump's Twitter use, leaving it to the president-elect. The hearing saw protests, including Code Pink activists and others dressed in symbolic costumes.  
END OF SUMMARY.
