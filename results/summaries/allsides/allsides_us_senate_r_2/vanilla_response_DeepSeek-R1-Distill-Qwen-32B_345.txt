Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Rex Tillerson's Senate confirmation hearing. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the main event is the clash between Tillerson and Rubio. I'll note their main points: Rubio pressed Tillerson on labeling Putin as a war criminal, but Tillerson avoided that label. He emphasized a more deliberative approach.

Next, the article mentions other topics like Russia's actions in Crimea, Tillerson's views on NATO, and his stance on other countries like China and Syria. I should include his criticism of the Obama administration's handling of Ukraine and his focus on defeating ISIS.

Also, there were lighter moments, like the climate change question and the protesters. I should briefly mention those to give a complete picture without going into too much detail.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll structure it with the main points first, then the other issues, and end with the lighter moments and the protest scene.

Let me make sure to include Tillerson's statements about Russia as an unfriendly adversary, the South China Sea issue, and his view on cyber threats as the greatest danger.

I should also mention the transition from the Obama administration's policies and Tillerson's emphasis on American leadership.

Finally, I'll wrap it up with the protesters to show the atmosphere of the hearing.

SUMMARY:  
During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing, Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio over policy toward Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson avoided the term, emphasizing a more deliberative approach. Tillerson criticized the Obama administration for not providing Ukraine with sufficient support to counter Russia's annexation of Crimea, calling it "a taking of territory that was not theirs." He also described Russia as an "unfriendly adversary" and acknowledged its threat to NATO allies. Tillerson criticized China's island-building in the South China Sea and radical Islam as a "grave risk," while calling ISIS an imminent threat. He also labeled cyber intrusions as the "greatest and most complex threat" to the U.S. Tillerson clashed with Rubio over labeling Saudi Arabia a "human rights violator" and avoiding harsher language on Duterte's policies. The hearing included lighter moments, such as Tillerson's refusal to discuss ExxonMobil's climate policies and a protester ejected for shouting "I reject you!" at him. Tillerson's testimony highlighted his focus on defeating ISIS and American leadership, while avoiding direct criticism of Trump's Twitter use. END OF SUMMARY.
