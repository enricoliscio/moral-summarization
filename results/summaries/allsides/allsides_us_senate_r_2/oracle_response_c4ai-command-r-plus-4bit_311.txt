SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced intense questioning from Senator Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson on his stance towards Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio challenged Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" for his actions in Syria and Crimea, but Tillerson refused, instead referring to Russia as an "unfriendly adversary." Tillerson also stopped short of calling Saudi Arabia a "human rights violator" or condemning the practices of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. He did, however, acknowledge the danger posed by Russia and the need for a forceful response to their aggressive actions, such as the taking of Crimea. Tillerson further addressed China's illegal building in the South China Sea and the threat of radical Islam, noting that cyber intrusions pose the greatest threat to US security. He criticized the Obama administration for stumbling in its foreign policy and emphasized the need for strong American leadership to avoid plunging the world into confusion and danger. The hearing was marked by protests, with activists disrupting the proceedings and expressing their rejection of Tillerson's nomination.
END OF SUMMARY.
