SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, where Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Tillerson refused, citing a more deliberative approach. Rubio also questioned Tillerson on policy regarding Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, with Tillerson taking a harder line towards Putin and Russia than President-elect Trump. Tillerson called Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stated that it "poses a danger" to the US. He also criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, calling it a "taking of territory" that was met with a "weak response". Tillerson emphasized the need for a "firm, forceful response" to Russia's actions. He also addressed other global issues, including China's "illegal" building of man-made islands and the threat of radical Islam. Tillerson warned that the US risks "plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger" if it fails to lead. END OF SUMMARY.
