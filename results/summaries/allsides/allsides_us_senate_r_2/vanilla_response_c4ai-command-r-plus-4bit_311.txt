SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced tough questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, particularly on issues related to Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson refused, instead calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary." Tillerson also took a hard line on Russia's annexation of Crimea and criticized the Obama administration's response. He addressed other global concerns, including China's activities in the South China Sea and the threat of radical Islam. Tillerson identified cyber intrusions as the greatest threat facing the U.S. and criticized the Obama administration's leadership on the world stage. The hearing was marked by protests and moments of levity, with Tillerson joking about his lack of knowledge on ExxonMobil's climate change policies. Tillerson also commented on Trump's use of Twitter, saying it was the President-elect's choice to communicate with the American people as he sees fit. Overall, Tillerson's hearing covered a range of foreign policy and national security issues, with a particular focus on Russia and its actions in Ukraine and Crimea.
END OF SUMMARY.
