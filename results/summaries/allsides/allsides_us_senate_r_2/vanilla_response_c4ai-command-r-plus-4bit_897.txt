SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson faced tough questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio pressed Tillerson on his stance towards Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, expressing concern over Tillerson's refusal to explicitly call Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson took a harder line on Russia than President-elect Trump, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and criticizing the Obama administration's response to the annexation of Crimea. He also addressed other global issues, including China's activities in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and the conflict in Syria. Tillerson identified cyber intrusions as the greatest threat facing the U.S. and criticized the Obama administration's leadership on the world stage. The hearing was interrupted by protesters, including some dressed as T-Rex dinosaurs, but Tillerson maintained his composure throughout the proceedings. Rubio and Tillerson clashed over their respective worldviews, with Tillerson asserting that he sees the world through a realistic lens.
END OF SUMMARY.
