SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Marco Rubio clashed during a contentious exchange, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Tillerson refused, citing his clear-eyed and realistic approach to dealing with different cultures. Rubio also tried to get Tillerson to categorize Saudi Arabia as a "human rights violator" and denounce the practices of the Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte, but Tillerson maintained his composure. Tillerson took a harder line on Putin and Russia, calling them an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that Russia poses a danger but is not unpredictable in advancing its interests. He criticized the Obama administration's weak response to Russia's taking of Crimea and emphasized the need for American leadership to prevent plunging the world into confusion and danger. Tillerson also addressed other threats, including China's illegal building in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and cyber intrusions, while also discussing the need to focus on defeating ISIS. The hearing was marked by protests, including Code Pink activists and T-Rex costumes, and an early protester was ejected for shouting at Tillerson.
END OF SUMMARY.
