SUMMARY:
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, refusing to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Rubio pressed Tillerson to take a stronger stance against Putin, but Tillerson remained calm and deliberative, explaining his vision for dealing with cultures. Tillerson did take a harder line towards Putin and Russia than Trump has, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it poses a "danger" to the US. He also condemned China's "illegal" building of man-made islands and radical Islam, which he said poses a "grave risk" to nations. Tillerson emphasized the need for the US to lead and take a firm stance against threats, warning that if it doesn't, the world will plunge into "confusion and danger". END OF SUMMARY.
