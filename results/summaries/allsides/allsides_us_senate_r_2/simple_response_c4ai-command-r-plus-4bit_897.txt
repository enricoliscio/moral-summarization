SUMMARY: During his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Senator Marco Rubio over Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pressed Tillerson to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal and a murderer, but Tillerson refused to do so. Tillerson also took a harder line on Russia than President-elect Donald Trump, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary." He criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and highlighted the need for American leadership on the world stage. Tillerson's hearing was marked by moral questions about his stance on human rights and international affairs, with Rubio challenging him to denounce human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. Tillerson navigated these questions with a more cautious and deliberative approach, emphasizing his realistic understanding of different cultures. The hearing was interrupted by protesters, including Code Pink activists and T-Rex costume-clad demonstrators playing on Tillerson's name.
END OF SUMMARY.
