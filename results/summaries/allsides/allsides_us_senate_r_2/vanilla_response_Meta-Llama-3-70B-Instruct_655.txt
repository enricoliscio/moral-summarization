SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, refusing to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and instead taking a more deliberative approach. Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson maintained a calm demeanor. While Tillerson wouldn't categorize Putin as a war criminal, he did take a harder line towards Russia than President-elect Trump, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it poses a danger to the US. Tillerson also addressed other global issues, including China's actions in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and the need to focus on defeating ISIS in Syria. The hearing was marked by tense exchanges and occasional moments of levity, with protesters in attendance.
