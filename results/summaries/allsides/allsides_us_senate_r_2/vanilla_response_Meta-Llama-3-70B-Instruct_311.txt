SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, refusing to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and instead taking a more deliberative approach. Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy towards Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson maintained a cool demeanor. Tillerson did take a harder line towards Putin and Russia than President-elect Trump, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it poses a danger to the US. He also criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and called for a more forceful response. Tillerson also addressed other topics, including China's actions in the South China Sea, radical Islam, and the need for the US to focus on defeating ISIS in Syria. The hearing was marked by tense exchanges and protests from the audience.

END OF SUMMARY.
