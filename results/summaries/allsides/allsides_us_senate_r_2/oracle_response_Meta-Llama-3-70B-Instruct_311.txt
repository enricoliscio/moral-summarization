SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, refusing to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson took a more deliberative approach. Tillerson stated that Russia "poses a danger" and is an "unfriendly adversary," but stopped short of calling it an enemy of the U.S. He also criticized the Obama administration's "absence of a very firm, forceful response" to Russia's taking of Crimea, which he deemed a "taking of territory that was not theirs." Tillerson emphasized the need to "serve" the American people and protect their interests, warning that the U.S. risks "plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger" if it fails to lead. He also highlighted the "grave risk" posed by radical Islam and the "greatest and most complex threat" of cyber intrusions. Throughout the hearing, Tillerson's calm demeanor contrasted with Rubio's aggressive questioning. END OF SUMMARY.
