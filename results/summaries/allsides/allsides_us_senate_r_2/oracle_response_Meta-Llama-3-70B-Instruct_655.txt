SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Tillerson refused, citing a more deliberative approach. Rubio also questioned Tillerson on policy regarding Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, with Tillerson taking a harder line towards Putin and Russia than President-elect Trump. Tillerson called Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stated that it "poses a danger" to the US. He also criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's "taking" of Crimea, saying it was a "weak response". Tillerson emphasized the need for the US to "serve" its own interests and "defeat" ISIS, warning that the country risks "plunging" into confusion and danger if it doesn't lead. He also highlighted the "risk" of cyber intrusions and the "threat" of radical Islam.
