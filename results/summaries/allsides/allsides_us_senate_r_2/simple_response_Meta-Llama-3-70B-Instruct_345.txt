SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, refusing to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and instead taking a more deliberative approach. Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy regarding Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson maintained a measured tone. While Tillerson wouldn't categorize Putin as a war criminal, he did take a harder line towards Russia than President-elect Trump, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and acknowledging its danger to NATO allies. Tillerson also addressed other global issues, including China's territorial claims, radical Islam, and the need to focus on defeating ISIS in Syria. Throughout the hearing, Tillerson emphasized the importance of a clear-eyed and realistic approach to dealing with cultures. The exchange highlighted the moral imperative of holding leaders accountable for their actions, with Rubio pushing Tillerson to take a stronger stance against human rights violators.
