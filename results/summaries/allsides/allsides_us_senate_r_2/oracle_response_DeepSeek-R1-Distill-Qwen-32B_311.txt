Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main focus is on the Senate hearing for Rex Tillerson's nomination as Secretary of State, where he clashed with Sen. Rubio. The article highlights their exchanges on Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. 

I notice that the author uses specific morally charged words like "poses," "advancing," "serve," "taking," "absence," "response," "building," "risk," "defeating," "threat," "intrusions," "stumbled," "plunging," and "ejected." My task is to include as many of these words as possible in the summary without losing the essence of the article.

I should structure the summary to cover the main events: the clash between Tillerson and Rubio, Tillerson's stance on Russia, his comments on other countries, and the lighter moments. I'll need to ensure that the summary flows logically, maintaining the moral tone by using those specific words.

I'll start by mentioning the clash and the key points they discussed. Then, I'll highlight Tillerson's views on Russia, using words like "poses," "advancing," "taking," and "response." I'll also include his statements on China, radical Islam, Syria, and ISIS, using terms like "building," "risk," "defeating," and "threat." 

I should also touch on the lighter moments and the protesters, using "ejected" to maintain the moral framing. Finally, I'll wrap up by mentioning Tillerson's view on leadership and the consequences of not leading, using "stumbled" and "plunging."

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures all the morally framed words effectively. I'll review the summary to make sure it's accurate and flows well, preserving the author's original moral perspective.

SUMMARY:  
During his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio over policy toward Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pressed Tillerson to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson declined, emphasizing a more deliberative approach. Tillerson described Russia as an "unfriendly adversary" and criticized its "taking" of Crimea, calling it an "illegal" move. He also criticized the Obama administration's "absence" of a "forceful response" to Russia's actions. Tillerson warned that Russia "poses" a danger and that its actions "advance" its interests unpredictably. He also addressed China's "illegal" island-building in the South China Sea and the "grave risk" posed by radical Islam. Tillerson called ISIS an "imminent threat" but identified cyber "intrusions" as the "greatest" threat to the U.S. He acknowledged the government had "stumbled" under the Obama administration, warning that failing to lead could "plunge" the world into chaos. Lighter moments included Tillerson's refusal to comment on ExxonMobil's climate policies and a protester being "ejected" for shouting "I reject you!" at him. Tillerson also defended Trump's use of Twitter, stating it was up to the president to decide how to communicate. END OF SUMMARY.
