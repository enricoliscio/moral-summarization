SUMMARY: At his Senate confirmation hearing, Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio over Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines. Rubio pressed Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal," but Tillerson refused, instead referring to Russia as an "unfriendly adversary." Tillerson also took a harder line on Russia than President-elect Donald Trump, acknowledging that Russia poses a danger and that its annexation of Crimea was illegal. On other topics, Tillerson criticized China's island-building in the South China Sea and radical Islam, and he called for a focus on defeating ISIS in Syria. He also stated that cyber intrusions pose the greatest threat to the US and that the country needs strong leadership to avoid global instability. Tillerson's testimony reflected his realistic and deliberate approach to foreign policy, but his exchange with Rubio highlighted their differing views on how to engage with controversial world leaders.
END OF SUMMARY.
