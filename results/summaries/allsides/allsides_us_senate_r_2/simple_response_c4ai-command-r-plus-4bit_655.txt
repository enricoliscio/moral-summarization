SUMMARY: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Senator Marco Rubio clashed during a contentious hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." Rubio also tried to get Tillerson to condemn other controversial leaders, such as Saudi Arabia's human rights violations and the practices of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Tillerson refused to engage in broad denunciations but took a harder line on Putin and Russia, calling them an "unfriendly adversary." He also criticized China's island-building in the South China Sea and radical Islam as grave threats. Tillerson's statement followed questions about his business ties to Russia and the Kremlin's alleged meddling in US politics. He defended his patriotism and pledged to serve the interests of the American people. During the hearing, Tillerson also addressed Syria, cyber intrusions, and the Obama administration's foreign policy, stating that the US needs to lead or risk a more dangerous world. The hearing was marked by moments of levity and protest, reflecting the high-stakes nature of Tillerson's potential appointment.
END OF SUMMARY.
