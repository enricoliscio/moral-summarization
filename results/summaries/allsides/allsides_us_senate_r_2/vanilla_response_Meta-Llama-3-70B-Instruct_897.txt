SUMMARY:

Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during his confirmation hearing, refusing to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" and instead taking a more measured approach. Rubio pressed Tillerson on policy towards Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines, but Tillerson maintained a calm demeanor. Tillerson did take a harder line towards Russia than President-elect Donald Trump, calling it an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it poses a danger to the US. He also criticized the Obama administration's response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. Tillerson addressed other global issues, including China's actions in the South China Sea and the threat of radical Islam. He also stated that the US needs to focus on defeating ISIS in Syria before discussing who should lead the country.
