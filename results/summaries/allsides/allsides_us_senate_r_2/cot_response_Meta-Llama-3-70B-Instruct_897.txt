SUMMARY:
Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson clashed with Sen. Marco Rubio during a contentious confirmation hearing, with Rubio pressing Tillerson to brand Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal". Tillerson refused, citing a more deliberative approach. Rubio expressed disappointment, calling Tillerson's stance "discouraging". Tillerson took a harder line towards Putin and Russia than Trump, calling Russia an "unfriendly adversary" and stating that it poses a "danger" to the US. He also criticized China's "illegal" building of man-made islands and radical Islam, which he said poses a "grave risk" to global stability. Tillerson emphasized the need for a strong US response, warning that "if we do not lead, we risk plunging the world deeper into confusion and danger". END OF SUMMARY.
