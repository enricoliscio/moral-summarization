SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, delivered a scathing rebuke to Republicans during her testimony to impeachment investigators. She *excoriates* them for promoting *unsubstantiated conspiracy theories* about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, which she calls a "fictional narrative" perpetrated by Russian security services. Hill refuses to *illegitimize* this narrative, emphasizing that Ukraine is not a US *adversary* and did not *attack* the US in 2016. She highlights the *consensus* conclusion of the US intelligence community, *bolstered* by the Mueller investigation, that Russia interfered on Trump's behalf. Hill also underscores the ongoing nature of Russian election interference and its detrimental effects on US national security and foreign service. She implores investigators not to advance falsehoods that *undermine* US interests and to pay attention to any efforts by the President or others to *impedes* or *subverts* national security for personal gain. Hill's testimony provides further insight into a key July 10 meeting where she claims Ambassador Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for President Zelensky.
