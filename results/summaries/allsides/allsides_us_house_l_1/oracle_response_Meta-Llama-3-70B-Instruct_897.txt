SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, excoriates Republicans for indulging in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She refuses to legitimize an alternative narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016, which she calls a "fictional narrative" propagated by Russian security services. Hill emphasizes that the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf, a conclusion bolstered by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's work. She criticizes Trump's efforts to undercut this notion and instead embrace a conspiracy theory that the hacks were an "inside job." Hill warns against promoting "politically driven falsehoods" that advance Russian interests, emphasizing that Russian election interference is an ongoing concern that has torn the nation apart and undermined US support for Ukraine. She urges investigators to focus on the truth, rather than indulging in efforts to further domestic political or personal interests. END OF SUMMARY.
