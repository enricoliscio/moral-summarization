SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill condemns Republicans for entertaining conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, echoing a false narrative propagated by Russian security services. Hill refutes these theories, citing the US intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered on Trump's behalf. She emphasizes the absurdity of the Ukrainian interference narrative, urging investigators not to legitimize it. Hill also highlights the ongoing nature of Russian election interference and its detrimental impact on US national security and political stability. She recounts a pivotal July 10 meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland implied a quid pro quo with Ukraine, which was later alluded to by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton. Hill's testimony underscores the moral imperative to safeguard US national security and expose efforts to subvert it, regardless of political or personal interests.
