Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Fiona Hill is testifying in the impeachment inquiry, criticizing Republicans for spreading conspiracy theories about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election, which Trump tried to use against Ukraine. She's refuting the idea that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the interference, calling it a Russian narrative. She mentions the consensus among US intelligence that Russia interfered, supported by Mueller's work. Trump has been questioning Russia's role and promoting an "inside job" theory. Hill provided details about a meeting where a quid pro quo was discussed, involving Ukraine's investigation into Biden's son's company. She emphasizes that promoting these falsehoods serves Russian interests and undermines national security. She also points out ongoing Russian interference and its negative impact on the US.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The author used words like "indulging," "leverage," "believe," "effort," "interfered," "bolstered," "undercut," "received," "embraced," "deal," "pushed," "advance," "impedes," "subverts," "further," "interference," "impact," "torn," "undermined," "politicized."

I'll structure the summary to highlight Hill's criticism of Republicans and Trump, the false narrative, the intelligence consensus, the July 10 meeting details, and the consequences of these actions on national security and US interests. I'll ensure the summary flows logically and stays within 200 words.

I should start by stating Hill's role and her main points. Then mention the conspiracy theories, the intelligence consensus, Trump's actions, the meeting details, and the impact on national security. I'll use the moral words to convey the criticism and the negative implications.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral framing words.

SUMMARY:  
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, criticized Republicans for indulging in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, which President Trump tried to leverage against Ukraine. She refuted the narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the interference, calling it a Russian fabrication. The US intelligence community, bolstered by Robert Mueller's work, concluded Russia interfered on Trump's behalf. Trump, however, has undercut this consensus by embracing the theory that the 2016 hacks were an "inside job." Hill provided detailed testimony about a July 10 meeting where a quid pro quo was discussed, involving Ukraine's investigation into Biden's son's company. She emphasized that promoting these falsehoods advances Russian interests and undermines US national security. Hill also highlighted the ongoing impact of Russian interference, which has torn the nation apart, questioned truth, and politicized US support for Ukraine. END OF SUMMARY.
