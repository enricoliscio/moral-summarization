SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, criticized Republicans for promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, Hill stated that this narrative is fictional and perpetuated by Russian security services. She emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf, a conclusion supported by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's work. Hill also recounted a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukraine's president agreeing to conduct investigations in exchange for a White House visit. Hill urged investigators not to promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests and highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has undermined US support for Ukraine and the career foreign service.
