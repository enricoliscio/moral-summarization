Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words that the author used. My task is to create a concise summary, keeping those words as much as possible, and make sure it's under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Fiona Hill is testifying in the impeachment inquiry. She's criticizing Republicans for believing in conspiracy theories about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election, which Trump tried to use. She calls this narrative "fictional" and propagated by Russia. She's refusing to legitimize the idea that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016.

The US intelligence community and Mueller concluded Russia interfered on Trump's behalf. Trump, however, has been questioning Russia's role and promoting the idea it was an "inside job." Hill provided details about a meeting where Ambassador Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukraine investigations into Biden's son and the 2016 interference. She also criticized the politicization of Ukraine support and the ongoing impact of Russian interference.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the listed moral words as possible: indulging, leverage, believe, effort, interfered, bolstered, undercut, received, embraced, deal, pushed, advance, impedes, subverts, further, interference, impact, torn, undermined, politicized.

I'll structure the summary to cover Hill's criticism of Republicans, the false narrative, the intelligence consensus, Trump's actions, the July 10 meeting, and the consequences of these actions. I'll use the moral words where appropriate to maintain the author's framing.

I should also keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include the moral terms and stay within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, criticized Republicans for indulging in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which President Trump tried to leverage to pressure Ukraine into investigating. She accused them of promoting a fictional narrative advanced by Russian security services, asserting that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016. The US intelligence community and Robert Mueller have concluded Russia interfered in 2016 on Trump’s behalf. Trump, however, has undercut this consensus by embracing a conspiracy theory that the hacks were an “inside job,” not Russia’s doing. Hill rejected this, detailing a July 10 meeting where Ambassador Gordon Sondland suggested a quid pro quo involving Ukraine’s investigations into Biden’s son and the 2016 interference. She emphasized the absurdity of Trump and Rudy Giuliani’s narrative, urging investigators not to promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests. Hill also highlighted the ongoing impact of Russian interference, noting how it has torn the nation apart, undermined the foreign service, and politicized US support for Ukraine. END OF SUMMARY.
