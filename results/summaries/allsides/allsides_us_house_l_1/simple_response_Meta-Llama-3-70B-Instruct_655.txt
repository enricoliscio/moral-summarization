SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly condemns Republicans for perpetuating unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She asserts that these claims are a "fictional narrative" propagated by Russian security services to distract from their own interference. Hill emphasizes that the US intelligence community has conclusively determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Donald Trump. She criticizes Trump's attempts to discredit this conclusion and instead blame Ukraine, which she argues is a US ally. Hill urges impeachment investigators not to promote "politically driven falsehoods" that advance Russian interests, and warns that Russian election interference remains an ongoing concern, undermining US national security and institutions. She emphasizes that the truth is being questioned, and US support for Ukraine has been politicized.
