SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, condemned Republicans for indulging in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She emphasized that these narratives are fictional and perpetuated by Russian security services to advance their interests. Hill refused to legitimize an alternative narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016, contradicting the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. She criticized Trump's efforts to undercut this notion and his embrace of a conspiracy theory that the election hacks were an "inside job." Hill highlighted the absurdity of the Ukrainian election interference narrative pushed by Trump and Rudy Giuliani, urging investigators not to promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests. She warned that Russian election interference remains an ongoing concern, tearing the nation apart, questioning truth, and undermining the US foreign service.
