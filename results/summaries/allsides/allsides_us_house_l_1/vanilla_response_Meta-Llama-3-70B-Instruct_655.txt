SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, criticized Republicans for promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She stated that these theories are unsubstantiated and perpetuated by Russian security services. Hill emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf. She also recalled a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo, conditioning Ukraine's White House visit on investigations into Joe Biden's son and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Hill urged impeachment investigators not to promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests. She highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has torn the nation apart, undermined the foreign service, and politicized US support for Ukraine.
