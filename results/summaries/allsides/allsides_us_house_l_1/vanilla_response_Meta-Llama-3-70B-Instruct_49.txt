SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, testified in her opening statement to impeachment investigators, criticizing Republicans for promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Hill stated that this narrative is "fictional" and perpetuated by Russian security services to distract from Russia's own interference. She emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf, and that Ukraine did not attack the US. Hill also recounted a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo, conditioning a White House visit for Ukraine's president on investigating a company linked to Joe Biden's son and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Hill urged investigators not to promote "politically driven falsehoods" that advance Russian interests and warned that Russian election interference remains an ongoing concern.
