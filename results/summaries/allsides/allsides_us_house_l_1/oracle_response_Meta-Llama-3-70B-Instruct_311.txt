SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly criticized Republicans for indulging in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She emphasized that these narratives are fictional and have been perpetrated by Russian security services to advance their interests. Hill refused to legitimize an alternative narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016, which is contrary to the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion. She highlighted that Trump's efforts to undercut the notion that he received help from a foreign adversary are misguided and that his embrace of conspiracy theories is harmful. Hill's testimony also revealed a quid pro quo arrangement between the US and Ukraine, where Ukraine's cooperation was conditional on investigating Joe Biden's son and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Hill urged investigators not to promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests and to focus on the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has torn the nation apart and undermined US support for Ukraine.
