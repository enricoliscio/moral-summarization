SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill rebuked Republicans for promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. Hill emphasized that the US intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf, and that this conclusion was supported by the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. She also provided a detailed account of a meeting in which US Ambassador Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill expressed concern about ongoing Russian election interference and the impact it is having on US politics and foreign policy. She urged investigators not to promote false narratives that advance Russian interests and to pay attention to any efforts by the President or others to impede US national security for personal gain.
