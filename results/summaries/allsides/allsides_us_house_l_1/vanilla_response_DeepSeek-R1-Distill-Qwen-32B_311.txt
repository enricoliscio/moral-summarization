Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's required.

The user provided a news article about Fiona Hill's statement during impeachment proceedings. They want a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also mentioned that the summary should be returned after those tokens. 

First, I'll read the article to get the main points. Fiona Hill is criticizing Republicans for spreading conspiracy theories about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election, which she says is a Russian narrative. She's emphasizing that the real interference was from Russia, not Ukraine. She also talked about a meeting where Ambassador Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukraine's investigations, which Bolton referred to as a "drug deal." Hill is urging the committee not to promote falsehoods that benefit Russia and points out that Russian interference is still a concern.

I need to condense this into a concise summary. I'll start by identifying the key elements: Hill's criticism of Republicans, the focus on Russian interference, the mention of the July 10 meeting, her warning about promoting false narratives, and the ongoing threat from Russia.

I should make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. Let me structure it to cover each main point without getting too detailed. I'll also need to use clear and direct language to convey the essential information.

Now, putting it all together, I'll start with Hill's criticism, mention the conspiracy theories, then the July 10 meeting details, her warning against false narratives, and end with the ongoing Russian threat. That should cover all the necessary points succinctly.

I'll double-check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content without adding any extra information. Once I'm satisfied, I'll format it as per the user's instructions, starting and ending with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill criticized Republicans for promoting unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election during her impeachment testimony. She dismissed claims that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was behind the interference, calling it a "fictional narrative" propagated by Russian security services. Hill emphasized that the U.S. intelligence community and Special Counsel Robert Mueller have concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Donald Trump. She also recounted a July 10 meeting where Ambassador Gordon Sondland suggested a quid pro quo involving Ukraine's investigations into Joe Biden's son and the 2016 election interference narrative. Hill warned against promoting politically driven falsehoods that benefit Russian interests and highlighted the ongoing threat of Russian election interference. She stressed that the 2016 Russian campaign continues to divide the nation and undermine U.S. national security. END OF SUMMARY.
