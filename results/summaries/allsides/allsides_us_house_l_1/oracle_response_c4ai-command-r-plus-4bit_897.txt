SUMMARY: In her testimony to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill rebukes Republicans for indulging in conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, asserting that this narrative advances Russian interests. She emphasizes the consensus conclusion of the US intelligence community that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf, which was bolstered by the Mueller investigation. Hill also provides an account of a meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for President Zelensky. Hill expresses concern about the impact of Russian interference, stating that truth is being questioned and US support for Ukraine is being politicized. She urges investigators not to promote falsehoods that advance Russian interests and to pay attention to any actions that impede or subvert US national security.
