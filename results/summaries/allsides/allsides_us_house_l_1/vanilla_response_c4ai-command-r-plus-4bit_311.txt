SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill criticized Republicans for entertaining conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. Hill refuted these theories, emphasizing the US intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered on Trump's behalf. She also reiterated her previous testimony about a quid pro quo involving US Ambassador Gordon Sondland and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Hill warned against legitimizing false narratives that Ukraine is a US adversary and highlighted the ongoing threat of Russian election interference. She urged investigators to focus on the subversion of US national security for domestic political interests. Hill's statement underscored the politicization of US-Ukraine relations and the damaging impact of Russian disinformation campaigns on American democracy.
