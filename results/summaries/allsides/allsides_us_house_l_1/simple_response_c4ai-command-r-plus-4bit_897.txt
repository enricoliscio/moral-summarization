SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill condemns Republicans for entertaining conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, echoing Russian disinformation efforts. She emphasizes the US intelligence community's conclusion, supported by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, that Russia interfered to benefit Trump. Hill rejects Trump's attempts to discredit this finding and his embrace of alternative conspiracy theories. She provides a detailed account of a meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland revealed a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill also underscores the ongoing threat of Russian election interference, expressing concern about the damage it has caused to US truth, unity, and foreign policy. She implores investigators not to legitimize false narratives that advance Russian interests and to address any subversion of US national security for personal gain. Hill's testimony highlights the moral imperative to confront Russian disinformation and safeguard US democratic values and national security.
