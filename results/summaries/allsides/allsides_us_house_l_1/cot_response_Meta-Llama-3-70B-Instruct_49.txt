SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, condemned Republicans for promoting a "fictional narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Hill refused to "legitimize" this "alternative" narrative, which she believes is a Russian-backed conspiracy theory. She emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus is that Russia interfered in the election to aid Trump. Hill's testimony highlighted the "absurd" nature of the Ukrainian election interference narrative pushed by Trump and Giuliani, which she believes is a threat to national security. She urged investigators not to promote "politically driven falsehoods" that "advance Russian interests." Hill warned that Russian election interference remains an ongoing concern, with the US being "torn apart" and "truth" being "questioned." END OF SUMMARY.
