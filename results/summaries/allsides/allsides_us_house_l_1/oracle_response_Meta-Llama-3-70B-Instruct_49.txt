SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, condemned Republicans for indulging in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She emphasized that this narrative is a fictional one perpetuated by Russian security services, and that it undermines the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. Hill refused to legitimize an alternative narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016. She warned against promoting politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests, and highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference. Hill's statement also underscored the impact of Russian interference, which has torn the nation apart, questioned truth, and undermined the career foreign service. She emphasized that if the President or anyone else impedes or subverts national security to further domestic political or personal interests, it is worthy of attention.
