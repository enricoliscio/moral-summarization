SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, testified that Republicans are indulging in "fictional" and "absurd" conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She refused to "legitimize" an "alternative narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016. Hill emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf. She warned against promoting "politically driven falsehoods" that "advance Russian interests" and urged investigators to focus on the "worthy" issue of national security being "impeded" or "subverted" for domestic political or personal interests. Hill also highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has left the nation "torn apart" and "truth" being "questioned". END OF SUMMARY.
