SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill strongly condemns Republicans for entertaining conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. She emphasizes that these theories are baseless and actually perpetuate a false narrative propagated by Russian security services. Hill reiterates the consensus of the US intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf, a conclusion supported by the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. She also provides an account of a meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland explicitly mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill expresses concern about the ongoing impact of Russian election interference, highlighting the damage it has caused to US truth, unity, and foreign policy. She implores investigators not to promote falsehoods that advance Russian interests and to focus on addressing the subversion of US national security for personal or political gain.
