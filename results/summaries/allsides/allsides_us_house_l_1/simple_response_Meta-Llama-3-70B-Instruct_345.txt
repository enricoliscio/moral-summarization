SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, slammed Republicans for promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She emphasized that these theories are unsubstantiated and perpetuated by Russian security services to distract from Russia's own interference. Hill refused to legitimize an alternative narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016, contradicting the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion. She warned against promoting politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests, highlighting the ongoing concern of Russian election interference. Hill's statement underscored the importance of upholding national security and truth, rather than furthering domestic political or personal interests. Her testimony serves as a moral rebuke to those who would compromise national security for political gain.
