SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, slammed Republicans for promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, Hill called out the "fictional narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016. She emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus is that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. Hill also recounted a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland implied a quid pro quo between the US and Ukraine, with Ukraine agreeing to investigate a company linked to Joe Biden's son in exchange for a White House visit. Hill urged investigators not to promote "politically driven falsehoods" that advance Russian interests and highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has undermined the US foreign service and politicized US support for Ukraine.
