SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly condemned Republicans for indulging in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She emphasized that this narrative is a fictional one perpetuated by Russian security services to advance their interests. Hill refused to legitimize this alternative narrative, which undermines the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf. She criticized Trump's efforts to undercut this notion and instead embraced a conspiracy theory that the hacks were an "inside job." Hill highlighted the absurdity of the Ukrainian election interference narrative pushed by Trump and Rudy Giuliani, which impedes and subverts national security to further domestic political or personal interests. She warned that Russian election interference is an ongoing concern, tearing the nation apart, undermining the foreign service, and politicizing US support for Ukraine. Hill urged investigators to focus on the truth and not promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
