SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly condemned Republicans for promoting unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She emphasized that this narrative is a "fictional" creation of Russian security services, aimed at distracting from Russia's real interference in the election. Hill refused to legitimize this alternative narrative, which undermines the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion that Russia interfered on Trump's behalf. She warned that promoting such falsehoods advances Russian interests and undermines US national security. Hill also highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has torn the nation apart, questioned truth, and politicized US support for Ukraine. Her testimony is a strong moral rebuke to those who prioritize personal and political interests over national security and truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
