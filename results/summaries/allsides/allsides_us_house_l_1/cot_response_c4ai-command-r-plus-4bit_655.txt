SUMMARY: Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, delivers a scathing rebuke to Republicans for entertaining unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. She refuses to legitimize the "fictional narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US. Hill emphasizes the consensus among US intelligence that Russia interfered, a conclusion bolstered by the Mueller investigation. She condemns Trump for embracing conspiracy theories and undercutting the truth. During a July meeting, Hill recounts an explosive episode where Ambassador Gordon Sondland implied a quid pro quo with Ukraine, which John Bolton dismissed as a "drug deal." Hill highlights the absurdity of the Ukrainian interference narrative, urging investigators not to promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests. She underscores the ongoing impact of Russian interference, stating that truth is questioned, US foreign service is undermined, and support for Ukraine is politicized. Hill implores the committee to recognize the gravity of impeding national security for personal interests.
END OF SUMMARY.
