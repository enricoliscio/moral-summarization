SUMMARY: In her testimony to impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly criticized Republicans for indulging in conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. Hill refuted these theories, stating that they are fictional narratives perpetuated by Russian security services and that the US intelligence community has conclusively determined that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. Hill also provided details of a meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland implied a quid pro quo arrangement, offering a White House visit for Ukraine's President in exchange for investigations that could benefit Trump politically. Hill emphasized the ongoing threat of Russian election interference and the damaging impact of promoting false narratives, urging investigators not to advance Russian interests by legitimizing conspiracy theories. She asserted that any efforts by the President or others to impede or subvert US national security for personal gain deserve scrutiny. Hill's testimony bolsters the case that Trump leveraged foreign powers to bolster his political prospects, while also undercutting the notion that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
