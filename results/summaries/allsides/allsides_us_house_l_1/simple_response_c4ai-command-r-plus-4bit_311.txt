SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill condemns Republicans for perpetuating conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. She refutes these theories, emphasizing the US intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered on Trump's behalf. Hill also highlights the absurdity of the narrative pushed by Trump and his associates, stating that it advances Russian interests and undermines US national security. She provides a detailed account of a meeting in which US Ambassador Gordon Sondland alluded to a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill's testimony underscores the ongoing threat of Russian election interference and the damaging impact of false narratives on US democracy and national unity. She implores investigators to focus on the facts and not to legitimize alternative narratives that serve foreign adversaries.
