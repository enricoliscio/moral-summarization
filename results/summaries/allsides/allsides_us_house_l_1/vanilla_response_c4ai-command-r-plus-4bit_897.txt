SUMMARY: Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill delivered a scathing opening statement to impeachment investigators, rebuking Republicans for propagating conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. Hill emphasized that the US intelligence community's conclusion, supported by the Mueller investigation, is that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. She refuted Trump's attempts to shift blame and discredit the Russian role, highlighting the absurdity of the Ukrainian interference narrative. Hill provided a detailed account of a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland revealed a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. She also expressed concern about ongoing Russian election interference and its impact on US politics and national security. Hill urged investigators to refrain from promoting falsehoods that advance Russian interests and to focus on addressing any efforts to subvert US national security for personal or political gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
