SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, excoriates Republicans for indulging in "fictional" conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She refuses to "legitimize" an "alternative narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016. Hill emphasizes that the Ukrainian election interference narrative pushed by Trump and Rudy Giuliani is "absurd" and promotes "politically driven falsehoods" that "advance" Russian interests. She warns that if the President or anyone else "impedes" or "subverts" national security for domestic political or personal interests, it is "worthy" of attention. Hill highlights that Russian election interference is an ongoing concern, and its impact remains evident today, with the nation being "torn apart" and truth being "questioned".
