SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, delivered a powerful rebuke to Republicans during her opening statement to impeachment investigators. She *excoriates* them for propagating conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, a narrative she calls "fictional" and a product of Russian disinformation. Hill emphasizes the absurdity of this theory, stating that Ukraine, not Russia, is portrayed as a US *adversary*. She *refuses* to legitimize this false narrative and asserts that the real threat comes from Russia, whose interference in US elections remains evident and continues to *undermine* American democracy. Hill also addresses the President's role, stating that if he "impedes or *subverts* the national security of the United States in order to further domestic political or personal interests, that is more than *worthy* of your attention." Her statement underscores the ongoing threat of foreign interference and the *subversion* of American interests for personal gain. 

END OF SUMMARY.
