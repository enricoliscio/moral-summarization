SUMMARY: In her testimony to impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly criticized Republicans for indulging in conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Hill asserted that these theories are unsupported and actually perpetuate a false narrative propagated by Russian security services. She emphasized the US intelligence community's conclusion, bolstered by the Mueller investigation, that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. Hill's statement underscored the absurdity of Trump and Giuliani's claims about Ukrainian interference, highlighting that Russian election interference is an ongoing threat to US national security. She also detailed a key meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for President Zelensky. Hill's testimony revealed the politicization of US support for Ukraine and the undermining of career foreign service professionals. She implored investigators not to promote falsehoods that advance Russian interests and to pay attention to any efforts by the President to impede or subvert US national security for personal gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
