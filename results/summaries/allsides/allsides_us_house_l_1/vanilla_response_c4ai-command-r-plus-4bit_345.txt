SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill rebuked Republicans for perpetuating conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, emphasizing that Russia was responsible for the interference. Hill provided a detailed account of a meeting in which US Ambassador Gordon Sondland allegedly confirmed a quid pro quo arrangement, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's White House visit conditional on investigations into Trump's political rivals. She also highlighted the ongoing impact of Russian election interference, stating that truth is being questioned and US national security is at risk. Hill retired in September but continues to emphasize the absurdity of the Ukrainian election interference narrative pushed by Trump and his associates. She asked investigators not to promote falsehoods that advance Russian interests and to focus on any efforts to subvert US national security for personal gain.
