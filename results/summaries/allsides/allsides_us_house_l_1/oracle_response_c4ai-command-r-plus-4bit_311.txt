SUMMARY: Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, delivered a scathing rebuke to Republicans during her opening statement to impeachment investigators. Hill condemned Republicans for indulging in baseless conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, a narrative that has been propagated by Russian security services and leveraged by President Trump to undermine the established conclusion of Russian interference. Hill emphasized the absurdity of the Ukrainian interference theory and urged investigators not to legitimize it, stating that it advances Russian interests and undermines US national security. She also highlighted the ongoing impact of Russian interference, noting that truth is being questioned and US support for Ukraine has been politicized. Hill provided a detailed account of a key meeting in which US Ambassador Gordon Sondland admitted to a quid pro quo arrangement, where Ukrainian investigations into Biden and purported Ukrainian interference were conditioned on a White House visit for President Zelensky. Hill's statement emphasized the moral imperative of addressing efforts to subvert and impede US national security for personal or political gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
