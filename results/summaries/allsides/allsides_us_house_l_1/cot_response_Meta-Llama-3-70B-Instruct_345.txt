SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly criticized Republicans for promoting a "fictional narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election. She refused to "legitimize" this "alternative" story, which she said was perpetuated by Russian security services. Hill emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf. She warned against promoting "politically driven falsehoods" that "advance Russian interests" and urged investigators to focus on the truth. Hill also highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has "torn apart" the nation and "undermined" the career foreign service. She called on investigators to take action against those who "impede" or "subvert" national security for personal or political interests. END OF SUMMARY.
