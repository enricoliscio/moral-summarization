SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, former National Security Council official Fiona Hill condemns Republicans for entertaining conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, echoing unsubstantiated claims made by President Trump. Hill underscores the US intelligence community's conclusion, supported by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. She refutes Trump's attempts to discredit this notion and emphasizes the absurdity of the Ukrainian interference narrative. Hill provides a detailed account of a July 2019 meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland alluded to a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill also highlights the ongoing threat of Russian election interference and expresses concern over the politicization of US-Ukraine relations and the undermining of US national security. She implores investigators not to propagate false narratives that advance Russian interests and to address any efforts by the President or others to subvert US national security for personal gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
