SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, excoriates Republicans for promoting "fictional" and "unsubstantiated" conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She refuses to "legitimize" an "alternative narrative" that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016. Hill emphasizes that the Ukrainian election interference narrative pushed by Trump and Giuliani is "absurd" and advances Russian interests. She warns that if the President or anyone else "impedes" or "subverts" national security for personal or political interests, it is "worthy" of attention. Hill highlights the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which has left the nation "torn apart" and "truth" being "questioned". She urges investigators to not promote "politically driven falsehoods" that undermine US support for Ukraine. END OF SUMMARY.
