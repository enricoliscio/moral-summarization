SUMMARY:
Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, delivered a powerful rebuke to Republicans during her testimony to impeachment investigators. Hill condemned Republicans for entertaining unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, asserting that these theories "perpetrated and propagated by Russian security services" serve Russian interests. She implored the committee not to "legitimize" these falsehoods, which portray Ukraine as a US *adversary*. Hill emphasized the well-established fact that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf, a conclusion supported by the US intelligence community and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. She also highlighted the ongoing nature of Russian election interference and its detrimental impact on US national security and truth. Hill's testimony further underscored the quid pro quo arrangement, as she recounted a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland explicitly mentioned the conditional nature of a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill's statement sent a strong moral message, urging the committee to recognize the *subversion* of US national security interests and the *undermining* of truth and professionalism within the foreign service due to politically driven falsehoods.
