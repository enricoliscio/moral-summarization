SUMMARY: In her opening statement to impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly rebuked Republicans for perpetuating conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Hill emphasized that the US intelligence community and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. She dismissed Trump's attempts to shift blame to Ukraine as a "fictional narrative" propagated by Russian security services. Hill also reiterated her previous testimony about a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador Gordon Sondland mentioned a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian investigations and a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill warned against advancing falsehoods that benefit Russia and urged attention to any efforts to subvert US national security for personal gain. She highlighted the ongoing impact of Russian interference, including the polarization of American politics and the undermining of US foreign service. Hill's statement underscored the importance of recognizing and addressing foreign interference in US elections.
