SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, criticized Republicans for promoting conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She stated that this narrative is fictional and perpetuated by Russian security services. Hill emphasized that the US intelligence community's consensus is that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf. She also recounted a July 10 meeting where US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland implied a quid pro quo between the US and Ukraine, conditioning a White House visit on investigations into Joe Biden's son and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Hill urged investigators not to promote politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests and highlighted the ongoing concern of Russian election interference, which is tearing the nation apart and undermining US support for Ukraine.
