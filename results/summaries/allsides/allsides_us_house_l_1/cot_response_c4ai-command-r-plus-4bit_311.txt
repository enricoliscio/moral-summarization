SUMMARY:
Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill delivered a powerful statement to impeachment investigators, excoriating Republicans for embracing conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Hill refused to legitimize the narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, was the adversary that attacked the US in 2016. She emphasized that this fiction has been perpetrated and propagated by Russian security services, and warned against promoting politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests. Hill also highlighted the ongoing impact of Russian interference, noting how it has torn the nation apart, questioned truth, and undermined US support for Ukraine. She condemned any attempts by the President or others to impede or subvert US national security for personal interests, deeming such actions worthy of attention. Hill's testimony underscores the moral imperative to uphold truth, safeguard national security, and hold accountable those who would corrupt it for their own gain.
