SUMMARY:

Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, strongly condemned Republicans for promoting unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She emphasized that these theories are fictional narratives perpetuated by Russian security services to distract from Russia's actual interference in the election. Hill refused to legitimize the alternative narrative that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked the US in 2016, which contradicts the US intelligence community's consensus conclusion. She warned against promoting politically driven falsehoods that advance Russian interests and emphasized that Russian election interference is an ongoing concern, tearing the nation apart and undermining the career foreign service. Hill's testimony highlighted the absurdity of the Ukrainian election interference narrative pushed by Trump and Giuliani, and urged impeachment investigators to focus on the truth.

END OF SUMMARY.
