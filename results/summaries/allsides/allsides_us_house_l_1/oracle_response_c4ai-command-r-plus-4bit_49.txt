SUMMARY: Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, delivered a scathing rebuke to Republicans during her testimony to impeachment investigators, accusing them of indulging in conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Hill asserted that these theories are baseless and only serve to advance Russian interests. She also provided a detailed account of a meeting in which US Ambassador Gordon Sondland allegedly admitted to a quid pro quo arrangement, with the White House visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky being conditional on investigations that could benefit President Trump politically. Hill emphasized the ongoing threat of Russian election interference and the damage it has inflicted on US democracy and national security. She implored investigators not to promote falsehoods that undermine the efforts of US security officials and bolster Russia's narrative. Hill's testimony underscores the moral imperative to hold those accountable who impede or subvert the national security of the United States for personal gain.
END OF SUMMARY.
