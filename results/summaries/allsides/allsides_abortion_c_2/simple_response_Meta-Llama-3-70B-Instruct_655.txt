SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, argues that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives believe that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The CEOs, including those from Twitter, Yelp, and H&M, are taking a stand to promote equality and women's empowerment. This move is seen as a moral imperative, with Seventh Generation's CEO stating that companies must be a force for good and speak up on pivotal issues like reproductive rights.
