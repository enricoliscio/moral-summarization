SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have taken a stand against laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. In a letter published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, these CEOs oppose the recent wave of legislation in states like Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri, which severely restrict abortion access. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," emphasizes that restricting reproductive care is "against our values, and is bad for business." These executives recognize the importance of protecting women's rights, equality, and empowerment in the workplace. They argue that such restrictions inhibit their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces and recruit top talent. Among the signatories are Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. The letter was organized by civil liberties and women's rights organizations, including the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and NARAL Pro-Choice America. Entertainment giants like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia have also threatened to cease production in Georgia due to its restrictive abortion law. These business leaders understand the importance of speaking up for reproductive rights and women's equality, taking a stand to protect these fundamental human rights. 

END OF SUMMARY.
