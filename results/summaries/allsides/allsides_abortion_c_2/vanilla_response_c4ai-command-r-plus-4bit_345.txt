SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws restricting women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter appears as a full-page ad in The New York Times under the heading "Don't Ban Equality." CEOs from companies such as Twitter, Yelp, H&M, and Glossier signed the letter to send a clear message that restricting access to reproductive care is against their values and bad for business. They argue that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. The Body Shop's U.S. general manager, Andrea Blieden, emphasizes that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right and essential for women's success and empowerment in the workplace. Seventh Generation CEO Joey Bergstein adds that it's crucial for business leaders to speak up on social issues and create positive change. A 2017 survey supports this view, finding that nearly half of millennials believe CEOs have a responsibility to speak up on societal issues. The letter was organized by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Center for Reproductive Rights, who also launched DontBanEquality.com to further their mission.
