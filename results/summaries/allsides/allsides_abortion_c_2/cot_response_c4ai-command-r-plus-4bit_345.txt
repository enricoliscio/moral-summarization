END OF SUMMARY
SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs have signed a letter *opposing* laws that *restrict* women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, titled "Don't Ban *Equality*," comes in response to recent *restrictive* abortion laws passed in several states, including Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. The executives argue that such laws *inhibit* their *ability* to *build* diverse and *inclusive* workforces and *protect* the *well-being* of their employees. They believe that *access* to reproductive healthcare is *essential* to respecting and *fulfilling* the *human rights* of women. CEOs from companies such as Yelp, H&M, and Glossier emphasize the *critical* importance of *autonomy*, *economic success*, *physical* and *mental health*, and *empowerment* in the workplace. The letter, organized by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other reproductive rights organizations, calls on business leaders to *recognize* the *importance* of standing up for *equality* and *empowerment*. As Seventh Generation CEO Joey Bergstein states, companies must be a *force for good* and drive *social change* on *pivotal* issues. By speaking out, these CEOs are taking *responsibility* and using their voices to influence *important* *reproductive rights* and *women's equality*, demonstrating their commitment to *heed* the *wishes* and *well-being* of their employees.
