Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should focus on the morally charged words the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about over 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws. They've published a full-page ad in The New York Times. The moral words here include "restrict," "ban," "legislation," "punishable," "rape," "incest," "restricting," "against," "protect," "access," "equality," "empowerment," "stand," "join," "speak," "inclusive," "abortion," "effect," "use," "rights."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the CEOs and their opposition to the laws, highlighting the states involved. Then, I'll note the companies involved and their reasons, emphasizing "access to reproductive care" as a human right. I should also include the CEOs' belief that this is essential for business and equality. Finally, I'll mention the organizations behind the initiative and the call for more leaders to join.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral points without being too verbose. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, calling such legislation "against our values" and "bad for business." The letter, published as a full-page ad in *The New York Times* under the heading "Don't Ban Equality," condemns recent restrictive abortion laws in states like Alabama, Georgia, and others. Signatories, including CEOs from Twitter, Square, Yelp, H&M, and The Body Shop, emphasize that access to reproductive care is a human right and critical for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. They argue that such laws inhibit diversity, talent recruitment, and workplace well-being. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, urges business leaders to "stand" and "speak" on this pivotal issue, asserting that reproductive rights and women's equality are essential for building an inclusive society. END OF SUMMARY.
