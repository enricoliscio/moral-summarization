SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, and banning doctors from performing abortions. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, emphasizes that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. By speaking out, the CEOs aim to fulfill their responsibility to stand up for women's equality and reproductive rights. The letter is a clear message that business leaders will not stand idly by while women's rights are restricted. END OF SUMMARY.
