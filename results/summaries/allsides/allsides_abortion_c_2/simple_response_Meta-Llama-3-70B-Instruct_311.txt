SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, emphasizes that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The letter is a moral stand against restrictive laws, with CEOs recognizing their responsibility to speak up on important social issues. By taking a stand, these business leaders aim to promote equality, women's empowerment, and social change.
