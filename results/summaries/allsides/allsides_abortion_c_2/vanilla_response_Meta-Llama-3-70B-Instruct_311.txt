SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, argues that such laws are "against our values, and is bad for business." The CEOs, including those from Twitter, Yelp, and H&M, believe that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The letter is a response to recent restrictive abortion laws passed in several states, including Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana. The CEOs' stance is part of a growing trend of business leaders speaking out on social issues, with many believing it is their responsibility to do so.
