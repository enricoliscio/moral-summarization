SUMMARY:
Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, citing that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, physical and mental health, and general empowerment in the workplace. The CEOs emphasize that companies must be a force for good, speaking up on pivotal issues like reproductive rights and women's equality. By taking a stand, they hope to create a more inclusive and equitable society. END OF SUMMARY.
