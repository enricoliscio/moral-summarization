Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the specific morally framed words they want included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about over 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws, using terms like "restrict," "ban," and "rights." They ran an ad in The New York Times under the "Don't Ban Equality" heading. The article mentions several states passing strict laws, including Alabama's law without exceptions for rape or incest. The CEOs argue that such laws are against their values and bad for business, impacting diversity and talent recruitment. They emphasize reproductive rights as a human right and a key issue for women's empowerment.

I need to make sure to include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Words like "restrict," "ban," "legislation," "punishable," "rape," "incest," "against," "protect," "access," "equality," "empowerment," "stand," "join," "speak," "inclusive," "abortion," "effect," "use," "rights" should be included.

I'll structure the summary to start with the CEOs' action, mention the states' laws, the reasons given by the CEOs, the impact on business, and the significance of reproductive rights as a human right. I'll also note the collaboration with organizations and the purpose of the website.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including all the key moral terms. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the user's request.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each moral term is appropriately placed without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral framing.

SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, calling such legislation "against our values" and "bad for business." The letter, published as a full-page ad in *The New York Times* under the heading "Don't Ban Equality," criticizes recent restrictive abortion laws in states like Alabama, Georgia, and Arkansas, which include no exceptions for rape or incest. CEOs from companies like Twitter, Square, Yelp, and The Body Shop argue that such laws hinder their ability to build diverse workforces and protect employee well-being. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right and critical for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, urges business leaders to stand against these bans and join the cause for equality. CEOs stress the importance of using their voice to advocate for reproductive rights, a pivotal issue for social change. The organizations have also launched *DontBanEquality.com* to educate the public and gather support. END OF SUMMARY.
