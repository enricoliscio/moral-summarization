SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws and regulations that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," emphasizes that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits the ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces and protect the well-being of employees. Among the signatories are Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from companies like Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. They argue that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The letter was published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and NARAL Pro-Choice America. These organizations also launched DontBanEquality.com, a site where CEOs can add their names to the letter. By speaking up, these business leaders affirm their commitment to equality, women's empowerment, and protecting human rights. CEOs like Joey Bergstein of Seventh Generation and Andrea Blieden of The Body Shop believe that a woman's access to reproductive healthcare is critical for her autonomy, success, and empowerment in the workplace. They stand against banning and restricting reproductive rights, emphasizing the need for businesses to be a force for good and create social change.
