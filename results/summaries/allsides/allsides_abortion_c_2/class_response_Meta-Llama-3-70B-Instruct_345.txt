SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, condemns legislation that bans abortion, punishable by up to 99 years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The CEOs argue that such laws inhibit their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. By speaking out, the CEOs aim to protect and fulfill this right, promoting equality and women's empowerment. The letter is a call to action, urging other business leaders to stand up against restrictive legislation and defend women's reproductive rights. END OF SUMMARY.
