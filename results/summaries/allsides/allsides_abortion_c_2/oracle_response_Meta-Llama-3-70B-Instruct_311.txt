SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, and are speaking out against legislation that bans access to these essential services. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, emphasizes that restricting access to reproductive care is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that such laws inhibit their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, physical and mental health, and empowerment in the workplace. By speaking out, these CEOs are standing up for equality, women's empowerment, and the protection of human rights. They urge other business leaders to join them in using their voices to promote inclusive and respectful policies. END OF SUMMARY.
