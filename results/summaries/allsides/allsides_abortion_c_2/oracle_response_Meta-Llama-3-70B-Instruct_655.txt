SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, and are speaking out against legislation that bans and punishes doctors for providing essential care. The executives argue that such laws are "against our values" and "bad for business," as they inhibit the ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of employees. The CEOs emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. By taking a stand, these business leaders are using their voice to promote equality and protect women's rights. As Seventh Generation CEO Joey Bergstein notes, "it's critical that business leaders stand up and use our voice on incredibly important issues" like reproductive rights and women's equality.
