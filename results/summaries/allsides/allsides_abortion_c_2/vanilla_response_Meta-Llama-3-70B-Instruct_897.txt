SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, argues that such laws are "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives believe that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. The letter emphasizes that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The initiative was spearheaded by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other organizations, and a website has been launched for people to learn more and for CEOs to add their names to the letter. The CEOs believe it's essential for business leaders to speak up on important issues like reproductive rights and women's equality.
