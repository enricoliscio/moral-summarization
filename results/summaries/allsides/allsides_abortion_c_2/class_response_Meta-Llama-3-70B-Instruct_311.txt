SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, and banning doctors from performing abortions. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, emphasizes that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The letter sends a clear message that CEOs will stand up and speak out against laws that ban equality and restrict women's rights. By doing so, they aim to fulfill their responsibility to respect and protect human rights. The signatories include CEOs from companies like Twitter, Yelp, H&M, and Glossier, who believe that companies must be a force for good and speak up on pivotal issues like reproductive rights.
