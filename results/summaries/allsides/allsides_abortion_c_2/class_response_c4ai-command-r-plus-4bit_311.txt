SUMMARY: In opposition to laws and regulations that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, over 180 CEOs have signed a letter. The letter, which appears as a full-page ad in The New York Times, comes less than a month after Alabama's governor signed the most restrictive abortion legislation in the U.S., banning abortion at any stage and punishing doctors with up to 99 years in prison, even in cases of rape or incest. CEOs from companies such as Yelp, H&M, and Glossier argue that such restrictions are against their values and bad for business, inhibiting their ability to build diverse workforces and protect the well-being of their employees. The letter emphasizes the importance of reproductive healthcare as a human right and a critical factor in women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. CEOs from The Body Shop and Seventh Generation affirm their commitment to using their voices to stand up for reproductive rights and women's equality, with several entertainment companies also considering ceasing production in states with restrictive abortion laws. The letter, organized by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other reproductive rights organizations, calls on business leaders to recognize the importance of their voice in protecting women's rights and equality.
END OF SUMMARY.
