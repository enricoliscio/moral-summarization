SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, and are speaking out against legislation that bans access to essential care. The letter, published in The New York Times, emphasizes that restricting access to reproductive care is "against our values, and is bad for business." The CEOs argue that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. By speaking out, these CEOs are standing up for equality and women's rights, and urging others to join them in protecting these fundamental rights. The letter is a powerful statement that businesses must be a force for good and use their voice to promote inclusive and equitable values.
