SUMMARY: In a bold stance against restricting women's reproductive healthcare rights, over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws and regulations that inhibit women's autonomy, economic success, and well-being. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," sends a clear message that restricting access to reproductive care, including abortion, is "against our values, and is bad for business." These executives recognize the importance of protecting and fulfilling women's human rights, including access to reproductive healthcare, which is essential for their empowerment in the workplace and beyond. Among the signatories are Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from companies such as Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. They stand against punitive legislation, such as the recent Alabama abortion ban, that punishes doctors with lengthy prison sentences and fails to make exceptions for cases of rape or incest. By speaking up, these business leaders affirm their commitment to creating diverse and inclusive workplaces and attracting top talent. They also emphasize the negative impact of such restrictive laws on their employees' well-being and their ability to build a thriving business. This collective action demonstrates that companies and their leaders have a crucial role to play in advocating for social change and standing up for what is right.
