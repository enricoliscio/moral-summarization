SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, emphasizing that such legislation is "against our values" and "bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that a woman's ability to access reproductive healthcare is critical to her autonomy, economic success, physical and mental health, and general empowerment in the workplace. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, sends a clear message that restricting reproductive rights is a threat to equality and women's empowerment. CEOs are urged to speak up and use their voice on this critical issue, emphasizing the importance of standing up for human rights and protecting the rights of women. By joining this cause, these business leaders aim to promote a more inclusive and equitable society.
