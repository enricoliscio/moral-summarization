SUMMARY: In a powerful display of solidarity, over 180 CEOs have united to oppose laws and regulations that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. Their letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," sends a clear message that restricting access to reproductive care is not only against their values but also bad for business. These executives recognize the negative impact of such legislation on their ability to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces and protect the well-being of their employees. Notable signatories include Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. They stand alongside other business leaders and entertainment companies like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia, who have vowed to consider halting production in states with restrictive abortion laws. The letter, organized by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Center for Reproductive Rights, emphasizes the importance of reproductive rights and women's equality. It calls on business leaders to speak up and take a stand against bans and restrictions that inhibit access, equality, and empowerment.
