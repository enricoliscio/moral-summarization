Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about over 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws through a full-page ad in The New York Times. They argue that such laws go against their values and are bad for business. They mention the impact on diversity, talent recruitment, and employee well-being.

I should highlight the moral stance they're taking, emphasizing human rights and equality. The CEOs are not just opposing the laws because it's bad for business, but because they believe in women's rights and the importance of reproductive healthcare as a human right.

I also need to include the collaboration with organizations like ACLU and the website DontBanEquality.com. The moral framing is about standing up for equality and using their influence to make a positive impact.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements clearly.
