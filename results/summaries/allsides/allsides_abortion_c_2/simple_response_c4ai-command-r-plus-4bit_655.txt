SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs have taken a moral stand against laws restricting women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. In an open letter titled "Don't Ban Equality," they argue that such restrictions are "against our values, and is bad for business." The letter, published as an ad in The New York Times, emphasizes the importance of reproductive healthcare for women's autonomy, economic success, and well-being. Among the signatories are Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. They join a growing movement of business leaders advocating for reproductive rights, with companies like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia threatening to cease production in states with restrictive abortion laws. The CEOs believe that their stance is not just about values but also about creating a force for good and driving social change. They recognize the importance of their voice in influencing societal issues, as reflected in a 2017 survey where nearly half of millennials expected CEOs to speak up on important matters. This collective action demonstrates a commitment to equality and women's empowerment, sending a powerful message that access to reproductive healthcare is a fundamental human right.
