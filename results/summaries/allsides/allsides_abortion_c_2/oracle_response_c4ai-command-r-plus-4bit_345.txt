SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have taken a stand against laws restricting women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. In a letter published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, CEOs from companies such as Twitter, Yelp, H&M, and Glossier, alongside fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, have spoken out against recent legislation in Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri that severely limits access to abortion. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," emphasizes the importance of protecting women's rights to reproductive care and the negative impact of such restrictions on businesses and their ability to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces. The executives argue that restricting access to abortion is "against our values, and is bad for business," and inhibits their ability to attract top talent and protect the well-being of their employees. This stance is supported by a 2017 survey showing that a significant portion of millennials and older generations believe CEOs have a responsibility to speak up on societal issues. The letter was organized by civil liberties and women's rights organizations, emphasizing the moral imperative to protect women's equality, empowerment, and access to essential healthcare.
