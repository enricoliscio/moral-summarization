SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws restricting women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, comes in response to recent restrictive abortion laws passed in several states. CEOs from companies such as Twitter, Yelp, H&M, and Glossier have joined fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg in signing the letter, stating that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse workforces and protect the well-being of their employees. The executives emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. This stance aligns with a growing expectation for CEOs to speak up on societal issues, particularly among younger generations. Entertainment companies like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia have also threatened to cease production in states with restrictive abortion laws. The letter, organized by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other reproductive rights organizations, sends a clear message that restricting women's reproductive rights is bad for business and against the values of many companies. 

END OF SUMMARY.
