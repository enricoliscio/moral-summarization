SUMMARY:
Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, emphasizing that such legislation is "against our values" and "bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build "diverse and inclusive" workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a "human right" essential for women's "autonomy, economic success, physical and mental health, and general empowerment" in the workplace. The letter sends a clear message that CEOs have a "responsibility" to speak up on "critical" issues like reproductive rights and women's equality. By taking a stand, these business leaders aim to be a "force for good" and promote "equality" and women's empowerment. END OF SUMMARY.
