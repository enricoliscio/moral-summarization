Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about over 180 CEOs signing a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. They placed a full-page ad in The New York Times with the heading "Don't Ban Equality." 

Hmm, the article mentions that this comes after Alabama passed a very restrictive abortion law, which is the most stringent in the U.S. It bans abortion at any stage, with severe penalties, and no exceptions for rape or incest. Other states like Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri have similar laws this year. 

The CEOs, including Jack Dorsey, Rebecca Minkoff, and others, signed the letter to show that restricting reproductive care goes against their values and is bad for business. They argue that such laws hinder their ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. 

Andrea Blieden from The Body Shop mentions that access to reproductive health is a human right and essential for women's empowerment. Joey Bergstein from Seventh Generation says it's crucial for business leaders to speak up on important social issues. 

There's also a mention of a 2017 survey where many millennials believe CEOs should address societal issues. Other companies like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia are considering stopping production in Georgia if the law passes. 

The letter was organized by organizations like ACLU and Planned Parenthood, and they have a website for others to join. Bergstein emphasizes that reproductive rights are a key issue of our time.

Alright, so I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the CEOs and the ad in The New York Times. Then, reference the restrictive laws in Alabama and other states. Explain the CEOs' stance against these laws, citing their impact on business and values. Include specific quotes from Blieden and Bergstein. Mention the survey and other companies' actions. Finally, note the organizations behind the letter and their website. Keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without going over the word limit.
