SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs have taken a stand against laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. In a letter published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, these CEOs, including Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, spoke out against legislation that inhibits women's rights and restricts their access to essential healthcare. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," emphasizes the importance of protecting and fulfilling women's human rights, and sends a clear message that such restrictions are "against our values, and is bad for business." CEOs from companies such as Yelp, H&M, and Glossier have joined fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg in taking a stand for equality and women's empowerment. They believe that a woman's access to reproductive healthcare is critical for her autonomy, economic success, and overall well-being. This bold move by business leaders is a powerful statement against the recent wave of restrictive abortion laws in states like Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri, some of which ban abortion entirely and punish doctors with lengthy prison sentences. It's encouraging to see companies and their leaders using their influence to speak up for what's right and to protect the rights and well-being of their workforce.
