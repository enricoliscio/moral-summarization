SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, calling it "against our values" and "bad for business". The letter, published in The New York Times, emphasizes that such legislation inhibits building diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruiting top talent, and protecting employees' well-being. The executives argue that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. By restricting access, these laws go against the values of equality and women's empowerment. CEOs believe it's essential to speak up and use their voice on this important issue, recognizing that companies can be a force for good. The letter is a clear message that CEOs will stand up for reproductive rights and women's equality, and will not stand idly by as these rights are restricted or banned.
