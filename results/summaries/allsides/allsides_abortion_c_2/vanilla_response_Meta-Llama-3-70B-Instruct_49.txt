SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, argues that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives believe that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The letter comes in response to recent restrictive abortion laws passed in several states, including Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. The CEOs, including those from Twitter, Yelp, and The Body Shop, are taking a stand to protect women's rights and promote equality.
