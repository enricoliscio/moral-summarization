Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. They want me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the text and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" words mean. These are words that carry a moral connotation, such as justice, equality, rights, etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each word that fits this criterion. I'll list them each with a star, as the user instructed.

Next, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those morally framed words as possible. I should ensure the summary captures the main points: the CEOs' opposition to restrictive laws, the impact on business and society, the support for reproductive rights as a human right, and the collaboration with organizations. I'll make sure to include words like "equality," "rights," "autonomy," and "justice" to maintain the moral framing.

I also need to structure the response with STEP 1 and then the SUMMARY, each clearly marked. I should keep the language clear and direct, ensuring that the summary flows logically and covers all key points without being too verbose.

Finally, I'll review everything to make sure I've followed the instructions precisely, including the formatting with tokens and the word limit. It's important to stay within the guidelines to meet the user's expectations accurately.

**SUMMARY:**  
More than 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, published as a full-page ad in *The New York Times* under the heading "Don't Ban Equality." The letter highlights that such legislation is "against our values" and harmful to business, as it hinders diversity, inclusion, talent recruitment, and workforce well-being. The signatories, including Jack Dorsey and other corporate leaders, emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, calls on business leaders to stand for reproductive rights and women's equality, which are pivotal issues of our time. Many companies, including Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia, have also pledged to oppose restrictive abortion laws, reflecting a growing belief that CEOs have a responsibility to advocate for societal justice and equality.
