Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words to include: restrict, Ban, banning, punishable, rape, incest, restricting, legislation, inhibits, protect, fulfill, equality, speak, stand. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Over 180 CEOs oppose restrictive abortion laws, advertising in The New York Times under "Don't Ban Equality." They mention Alabama's strict law with no exceptions for rape or incest. Other states have similar laws. The CEOs argue that such legislation is against their values and bad for business, affecting workforce diversity and talent recruitment. They emphasize reproductive rights as a human right and critical for women's autonomy and economic success. The ACLU and other organizations are spearheading the effort, and other companies are considering production moves due to these laws. 

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, making sure to include the morally framed words. I'll start by mentioning the CEOs opposing the laws, using "restrict" and "Ban." I'll note the Alabama law, using "banning" and "punishable." Then, highlight the CEOs' stance on it being against their values and bad for business, using "restricting" and "legislation." I'll include their emphasis on reproductive rights as a human right, using "protect" and "fulfill." Also, mention the importance of equality and their commitment to stand against these laws. Finally, include the organizations involved and the impact on business decisions, using "speak" and "stand." 

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but ensure all key points and moral terms are included. Let me structure this step by step, making sure each moral word is appropriately placed without making the summary too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, published as a full-page ad in *The New York Times* under the heading "Don't Ban Equality." The letter comes amid restrictive abortion legislation in states like Alabama, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison for performing abortions, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The executives argue that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse workforces and protect employees' well-being, emphasizing that access to reproductive care is a human right and critical for women's autonomy and economic success. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, urges business leaders to stand against these laws, highlighting the importance of equality and reproductive rights. CEOs like Jack Dorsey and Andrea Blieden stress the need for companies to speak up on this pivotal issue, as it aligns with their values and commitment to social change. The campaign, featured on DontBanEquality.com, underscores the moral imperative to protect women's rights and fulfill their human dignity. END OF SUMMARY.
