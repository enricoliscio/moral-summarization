Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about over 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws. They've published a full-page ad in The New York Times under the heading "Don't Ban Equality." This comes after Alabama passed a strict abortion law, and other states like Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri have done similar things.

The CEOs, including Jack Dorsey and others from big companies, are saying that these laws go against their values and are bad for business. They mention it affects their ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. Andrea Blieden from The Body Shop emphasizes that reproductive health is a human right. Seventh Generation's CEO, Joey Bergstein, thinks it's important for business leaders to speak up on social issues.

There's also a mention of a 2017 survey showing millennials, Gen Xers, and Boomers believe CEOs should address societal issues. Other companies like Disney and Netflix might stop production in Georgia if the law is enacted. The letter was organized by groups like ACLU and Planned Parenthood, and they have a website for more info.

So, the summary needs to include the number of CEOs, the ad in NYT, opposition to Alabama and other states' laws, reasons related to business and human rights, examples of companies, and the organizations behind the effort. It should be concise, under 200 words, and in a clear structure.
