SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, argues that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives believe that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces, recruit top talent, and protect employee well-being. The letter emphasizes that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. CEOs from companies including Twitter, Yelp, and H&M have signed the letter, which was spearheaded by organizations such as the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. The move comes after several states, including Alabama and Georgia, have adopted restrictive abortion laws.
