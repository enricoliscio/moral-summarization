SUMMARY:
Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, stating that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The CEOs believe it's their responsibility to speak up on this pivotal issue, as companies can and must be a force for good. The letter is part of a larger effort to protect women's equality and human rights, and to ensure that U.S. law respects, protects, and fulfills these rights. END OF SUMMARY.
