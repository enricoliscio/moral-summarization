Okay, so I need to help the user summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about over 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws. They ran an ad in The New York Times under "Don't Ban Equality." The laws, like Alabama's, are very strict, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The CEOs argue that these laws go against their values and are bad for business because they affect diversity, talent recruitment, and employee well-being. They emphasize reproductive rights as a human right and a critical part of women's autonomy and empowerment. The ACLU and other organizations are behind the initiative, and other companies are also taking stands, like Disney considering stopping production in Georgia.

Now, I need to make sure to include the morally charged words: restrict, ban, legislation, banning, punishable, rape, incest, restricting, against, protect, access, equality, empowerment, stand, join, speak, inclusive, abortion, effect, use, rights.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the CEOs' opposition, the restrictive laws, the impact on business values, the human rights aspect, and the broader support from other companies. I'll ensure each sentence incorporates the necessary moral terms without making it too verbose.

I should also keep the summary under 200 words. Let me start drafting, making sure each key point is covered succinctly and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, emphasizing that such legislation is "against our values" and "bad for business." The letter, published in *The New York Times* under the heading "Don't Ban Equality," condemns restrictive abortion laws, such as Alabama's ban on abortion at any stage of pregnancy, punishable by 99 years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. CEOs from companies like Twitter, H&M, and The Body Shop argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits diversity, talent recruitment, and employee well-being. They stress that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, urges business leaders to "stand" against these laws, highlighting the importance of reproductive rights and equality. Companies like Disney have also threatened to halt production in states with restrictive laws, signaling a growing corporate commitment to using their voice to protect women's rights. END OF SUMMARY.
