SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, argues that such laws are "against our values, and is bad for business." The CEOs, including those from Twitter, Yelp, and H&M, believe that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse workforces and protect employees' well-being. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. The letter comes after several states, including Alabama and Georgia, have adopted restrictive abortion laws. Other business leaders, including Disney and Netflix, have also spoken out against these laws. The CEOs' stance is seen as essential for creating social change and promoting women's equality.
