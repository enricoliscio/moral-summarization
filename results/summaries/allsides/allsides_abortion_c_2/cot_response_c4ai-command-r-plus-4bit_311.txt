SUMMARY: In opposition to laws restricting women's reproductive healthcare, 180+ CEOs signed a letter titled "Don't Ban Equality." The letter, published as an ad in The New York Times, expresses moral outrage at the recent wave of restrictive abortion laws in several US states, notably Alabama. CEOs from companies like Twitter, Yelp, H&M, and Glossier, stand united in their belief that such laws inhibit their ability to foster diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is essential for women's autonomy, economic success, physical and mental health, and empowerment in the workplace. By signing the letter, these business leaders take a stand for equality and against what they perceive as unjust restrictions on women's rights. They assert that their actions are driven by their values and a belief that businesses can and should be a force for good in society. This collective statement sends a powerful message that reproductive rights are integral to women's equality and must be protected as a human right.
