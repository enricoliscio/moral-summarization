SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs have united to oppose legislation that restricts women's access to reproductive healthcare and bans abortion. In a letter titled "Don't Ban Equality," these business leaders affirm that such restrictions are "against our values, and is bad for business." They argue that limiting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces and protect the well-being of their employees. Among the signatories are Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from companies like Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. The letter emphasizes the importance of reproductive rights in ensuring women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The CEOs are joining a growing movement of business leaders speaking up for reproductive rights and equality, with entertainment giants like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia threatening to cease production in states with restrictive abortion laws. This collective action demonstrates a commitment to using their influence to protect the rights and well-being of their employees and society at large.
