SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs, including Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," was published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, and argues that such restrictions are "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that limiting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces and protect the well-being of their employees. This moral stance is supported by a significant portion of their employees and customers, especially millennials, who believe that CEOs have a responsibility to speak up on societal issues. The letter was organized by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Center for Reproductive Rights, and is part of a growing trend of businesses taking a stand on social and political issues, using their influence to promote equality and human rights. Some entertainment companies have even threatened to cease production in states with restrictive abortion laws, showing that businesses are willing to take concrete action to support their values. This demonstrates a powerful alignment between moral conviction and economic consequences, sending a clear message that reproductive rights are not just a women's issue, but a fundamental human rights issue that impacts all aspects of society, including the business world.
