SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, emphasizes that such restrictions are "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that these laws inhibit their ability to build diverse workforces, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The letter is a moral stand against restrictive abortion laws, which have been adopted by several states, including Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. By speaking out, these CEOs are using their voices to promote women's equality and human rights, and to create a positive impact on society.
