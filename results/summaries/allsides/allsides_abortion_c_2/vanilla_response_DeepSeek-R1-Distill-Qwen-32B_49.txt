Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about over 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws. They've published a full-page ad in The New York Times titled "Don't Ban Equality." This comes after Alabama passed a very strict law, banning abortion entirely without exceptions for rape or incest. Other states like Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri have similar laws.

The CEOs from companies like Twitter, Square, Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier are involved. They're saying these laws go against their values and are bad for business. They mention it affects their ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. Andrea Blieden from The Body Shop emphasizes that reproductive health is a human right and important for women's autonomy and economic success.

Seventh Generation's CEO, Joey Bergstein, believes companies should be forces for good and that this is a pivotal social issue. A survey showed many millennials, Gen Xers, and Boomers think CEOs should speak up on societal issues. Earlier, female CEOs ran an ad supporting abortion as a human right. Companies like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia might stop production in Georgia if the law takes effect.

The letter was organized by organizations like ACLU and Planned Parenthood, with a website for more info and for CEOs to sign on. Bergstein stresses the importance of business leaders using their voice on critical issues like reproductive rights and women's equality.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the number of CEOs, the ad in NYT, opposition to restrictive laws, impact on business, human rights aspect, and the organizations involved. Make sure it's clear and within the word limit.
