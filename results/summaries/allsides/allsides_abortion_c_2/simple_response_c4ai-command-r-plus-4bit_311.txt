SUMMARY: In a powerful display of corporate social responsibility, over 180 CEOs have taken a stand against the wave of restrictive abortion laws sweeping the United States. With a full-page ad in The New York Times, these executives are sending a clear message that restricting access to reproductive healthcare is not only immoral but also bad for business. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," emphasizes the importance of reproductive rights in ensuring women's autonomy, economic success, and overall empowerment. Among the signatories are Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from companies like Yelp, H&M, and Glossier. They recognize that such legislation inhibits their ability to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces and protect the well-being of their employees. The Body Shop's U.S. General Manager, Andrea Blieden, affirms that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, and Seventh Generation CEO Joey Bergstein emphasizes the responsibility of business leaders to drive social change. This act of corporate activism aligns with the growing expectation, particularly among millennials, that CEOs use their influence to address pressing societal issues. The effort was organized by civil liberties and reproductive rights organizations, underlining the critical connection between reproductive freedom and equality.
