Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing restrictive abortion laws. The letter is in The New York Times under "Don't Ban Equality." It mentions Alabama's recent law, which is very strict, banning abortion entirely without exceptions for rape or incest. Other states like Georgia, Arkansas, etc., have similar laws.

The CEOs, including Jack Dorsey and others, say this is against their values and bad for business. They argue that such laws hinder their ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. Andrea Blieden from The Body Shop emphasizes that reproductive rights are human rights and crucial for women's autonomy and economic success.

Seventh Generation's CEO mentions that companies should be forces for good and that speaking up is essential. A survey shows that many millennials believe CEOs should address societal issues. Disney and others might stop production in Georgia if the law passes. The letter is spearheaded by organizations like ACLU and has a website for more info.

I need to capture the moral stance: CEOs valuing equality, human rights, and the impact on business and society. I'll structure the summary to highlight the opposition to the laws, the reasons given (values, business impact, human rights), and the broader implications for corporate responsibility.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the main points without losing the moral emphasis. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key element is covered.
