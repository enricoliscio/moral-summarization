SUMMARY:
Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, stating that such legislation is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives believe that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, physical and mental health, and general empowerment in the workplace. The CEOs assert that it's essential for businesses to be a force for good, and that they have a responsibility to speak up on important issues like reproductive rights and women's equality. By taking a stand, they aim to promote equality and women's empowerment.
