SUMMARY:
Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, as they believe it's "against our values" and "bad for business." The executives argue that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, sends a clear message that restricting reproductive care is "against our values" and "bad for business." The CEOs believe it's essential to speak up on this critical issue, as companies must be a force for good and respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
