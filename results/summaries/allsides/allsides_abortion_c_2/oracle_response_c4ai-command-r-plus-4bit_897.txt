SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws and regulations that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," was published as a full-page ad in The New York Times and comes in response to recent restrictive abortion legislation passed in several states, including Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri. CEOs from companies such as Twitter, Square, Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier have joined fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg in taking a stand against these laws, stating that they are "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize the importance of reproductive health care access as a human right and a critical factor in women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. The letter was organized by civil liberties and women's rights organizations, including the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Center for Reproductive Rights. Entertainment companies such as Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia have also threatened to cease production in Georgia if the state's restrictive abortion law takes effect. The CEOs and executives who have spoken out believe that it is their responsibility to use their voices to stand up for reproductive rights and women's equality.
