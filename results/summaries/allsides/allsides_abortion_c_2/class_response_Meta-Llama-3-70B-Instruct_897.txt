SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict and ban women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, sends a clear message that restricting access to reproductive care is "against our values, and is bad for business." The executives argue that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines and protect the well-being of their employees. They emphasize that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. By speaking out, these CEOs are standing up for equality and women's rights, recognizing that companies must be a force for good. The letter is a response to recent restrictive abortion laws in states like Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri, which ban doctors from performing abortions at any stage of pregnancy, punishable by up to 99 years in prison, with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest.
