SUMMARY:

Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, and ban equality. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, comes in response to Alabama's recent legislation banning doctors from performing abortions at any stage of pregnancy, punishable by 99 years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Similar laws have been adopted in other states, including Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri. The CEOs, including those from Twitter, Square, and The Body Shop, argue that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces, recruit top talent, and protect the well-being of their employees. They believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right, critical to women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. The executives urge other business leaders to speak up and stand against restricting women's reproductive rights, emphasizing that companies must be a force for good and respect, protect, and fulfill women's human rights.
