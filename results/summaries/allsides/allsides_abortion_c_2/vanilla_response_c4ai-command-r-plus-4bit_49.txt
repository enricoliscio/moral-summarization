SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs, including Twitter's Jack Dorsey, have signed a letter opposing laws restricting women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, argues that such restrictions are "against our values, and is bad for business," inhibiting the ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. Among the signatories are CEOs from companies like Yelp, H&M, and Glossier, who believe that access to reproductive healthcare is essential for women's empowerment and success. The Body Shop's U.S. general manager, Andrea Blieden, emphasizes that reproductive healthcare is a human right, and Seventh Generation CEO Joey Bergstein highlights the importance of businesses speaking up for social change. The letter was organized by civil liberties and women's rights organizations, reflecting a growing belief that CEOs have a responsibility to address societal issues. Entertainment giants like Disney and Netflix have also threatened to boycott states with restrictive abortion laws, demonstrating the business community's increasing engagement in this debate.
END OF SUMMARY.
