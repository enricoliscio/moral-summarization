Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about over 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws. They ran a full-page ad in The New York Times titled "Don't Ban Equality." The laws in states like Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri are really strict, with Alabama's law being the most extreme, even banning abortion in cases of rape or incest. The CEOs argue that these laws go against their values and are bad for business because they hinder diversity, recruitment, and the well-being of employees.

The companies involved include Twitter, Square, Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. Their CEOs believe that access to reproductive healthcare is a human right and essential for women's autonomy and economic success. They emphasize that companies should be forces for good and stand up for social change.

Additionally, the article mentions a 2017 survey where many millennials believe CEOs should speak up on societal issues. Other companies like Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia are considering stopping production in Georgia if the law takes effect. The initiative was led by organizations like the ACLU and NARAL Pro-Choice America, with a website for more information.

I need to include the morally framed words: restrict, Ban, banning, punishable, rape, incest, restricting, legislation, inhibits, protect, fulfill, equality, speak, stand. I should make sure these words are present in the summary without making it too long.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the CEOs opposing the laws, mention the ad in NYT, the restrictive nature of the laws, especially Alabama's. Then talk about the impact on business values, diversity, recruitment, and employee well-being. Include the human rights aspect, the companies' stance on equality and women's empowerment. Mention the survey about CEOs speaking up and other companies considering production stops. Finally, note the organizations behind the initiative and the importance of business leaders standing up.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points and the moral words. Let me draft it now.

SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, publishing a full-page ad in *The New York Times* titled "Don't Ban Equality." These laws, such as Alabama's extreme ban on abortion at any stage of pregnancy, punishable by 99 years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest, are seen as inhibiting diversity, recruitment, and workplace well-being. CEOs from companies like Twitter, H&M, and The Body Shop argue that such legislation restricts equality and violates human rights. They emphasize that access to reproductive care is critical for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and NARAL Pro-Choice America, urges business leaders to stand against restrictive laws, highlighting the importance of protecting and fulfilling women's rights. Companies like Disney and Netflix have also threatened to cease production in states with such laws. Bergstein of Seventh Generation notes that CEOs must speak up on pivotal social issues, as reproductive rights and equality are among the most critical of our time. END OF SUMMARY.
