SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs, including Twitter's Jack Dorsey and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff, have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, published as a full-page ad in The New York Times, comes in response to recent restrictive abortion laws passed in several US states, including Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri. The executives argue that such legislation inhibits their ability to build diverse workforces and recruit top talent. Some companies, such as Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia, have even threatened to cease production in Georgia if its restrictive abortion law takes effect. The letter was organized by the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Center for Reproductive Rights, who argue that access to reproductive healthcare is essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace. Seventh Generation CEO Joey Bergstein emphasizes the importance of business leaders speaking up on social issues, stating that companies must be a force for good and create social change. The letter reflects a growing expectation, particularly among younger generations, for CEOs to speak up on societal issues.
