Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about 180 CEOs opposing restrictive abortion laws, using morally charged words like "restrict," "ban," "punishable," and "equality." 

I need to ensure that the summary includes these words and maintains the moral stance presented. The key elements are the CEOs' opposition, the specific laws mentioned, their impact on businesses, and the support for reproductive rights as a human right. Also, the collaboration with organizations like ACLU and the website they created should be included.

I should structure the summary to highlight the CEOs' actions, the reasons they oppose the laws, and the broader implications for equality and business. I'll make sure to keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the morally framed words as much as possible. 

Let me start by outlining the main points: the number of CEOs, the ad in The New York Times, the laws in Alabama and other states, the impact on business, the human rights angle, and the organizations involved. I'll weave these together, making sure to use the specified moral terms. 

I should also mention the support from other companies and the importance of business leaders speaking up. That should cover all the essential points while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Over 180 CEOs have signed a letter opposing laws that restrict women's access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, published as a full-page ad in *The New York Times* under the heading "Don't Ban Equality." The letter follows Alabama's restrictive abortion law, which bans the procedure at any stage of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and similar legislation in other states. The CEOs argue that such *restrictive* laws *inhibit* their ability to build diverse workforces and protect employees' well-being, emphasizing that access to reproductive care is a *human right*. Companies like The Body Shop and Seventh Generation highlight the importance of *equality* and women's empowerment, stating that reproductive rights are critical for women's autonomy and economic success. The letter, spearheaded by organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, urges business leaders to *speak* out on this pivotal issue, as it reflects their values and commitment to *protecting* and *fulfilling* human rights. END OF SUMMARY.
