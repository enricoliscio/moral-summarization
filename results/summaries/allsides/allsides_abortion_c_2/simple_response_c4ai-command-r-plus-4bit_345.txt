SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs, including Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, have signed a letter opposing laws restricting women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion. The letter, titled "Don't Ban Equality," emphasizes that restricting access to reproductive care inhibits the ability to build diverse and inclusive workforces and protect the well-being of employees. CEOs argue that access to reproductive healthcare is essential for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace, and that it is a human right that must be respected and protected. The letter comes as several states, including Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri, have passed restrictive abortion laws. Some entertainment companies have also threatened to cease production in states with restrictive abortion laws, citing concerns over their employees' wishes. The letter, spearheaded by civil liberties and women's rights organizations, calls on business leaders to use their voices to stand up for reproductive rights and women's equality.
