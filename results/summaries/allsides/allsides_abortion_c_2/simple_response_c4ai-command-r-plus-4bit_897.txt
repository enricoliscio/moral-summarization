SUMMARY: More than 180 CEOs have united in defense of women's reproductive healthcare, including abortion, by signing a letter titled "Don't Ban Equality." This bold statement comes in response to the wave of restrictive abortion laws being passed in several US states, notably Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Indiana, and Missouri. The letter, which appears as a full-page ad in The New York Times, emphasizes the CEOs' stance that such restrictions are not only against their values but also detrimental to their businesses. They argue that limiting access to reproductive care inhibits their ability to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces and attract top talent. Among the signatories are Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from Yelp, H&M, The Body Shop, and Glossier. The letter was organized by civil liberties and women's rights organizations, including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. These business leaders recognize the importance of reproductive healthcare for women's autonomy, economic success, and empowerment in the workplace, and they refuse to stay silent on this critical issue.

END OF SUMMARY.
