SUMMARY: In opposition to recent restrictive abortion laws passed in several US states, over 180 CEOs have signed an open letter titled "Don't Ban Equality," arguing that such legislation inhibits their ability to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces and is against their values. The letter appears as a full-page ad in The New York Times and is spearheaded by organizations including the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and NARAL Pro-Choice America. Among the signatories are Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Diane Von Furstenburg, and CEOs from companies like Yelp, H&M, and Glossier. These executives emphasize the importance of reproductive healthcare access for women's empowerment and success in the workplace, with some citing it as a human right. The letter follows similar actions by entertainment companies and other business leaders, highlighting the growing recognition of the role companies and their leaders play in societal issues.

END OF SUMMARY.
