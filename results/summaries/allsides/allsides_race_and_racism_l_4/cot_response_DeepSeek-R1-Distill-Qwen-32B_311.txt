Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided specific instructions, so I should follow them carefully.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. The user mentioned that these are single words with moral connotations. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "condemn," "racist," "hate," "fear," etc. I'll list each on a new line starting with an asterisk.

Next, I have to write a concise summary, keeping it under 200 words. I need to make sure to include as many of the identified moral words as possible. The summary should capture the main points: Obama's criticism of Trump, Trump's response, the context of mass shootings, and the political implications.

I should structure the summary to include both Obama's and Trump's perspectives, the criticism towards Trump's rhetoric, and the impact on public opinion. I'll ensure that the moral framing is evident, using words like "condemn," "racist," "hate," etc., to reflect the tone of the original article.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content without adding any personal opinions. Keeping it within the word limit is crucial, so I'll be concise but thorough.

**SUMMARY:**  

Barack Obama criticized the normalization of racist sentiments in the wake of recent mass shootings, indirectly targeting Donald Trump. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, suggesting Obama's presidency saw 32 mass shootings. Trump has been accused of emboldening white nationalists and avoiding gun control discussions, instead blaming video games and mental illness. Obama linked the El Paso shooting to ideologies promoting white supremacy and urged rejecting leaders who demonize others. Trump has faced backlash for stoking racial tensions, including tweets about congresswomen of color and derogatory comments about minority communities. The article highlights the moral and political divide over gun control, racism, and leadership accountability in addressing national tragedies.
