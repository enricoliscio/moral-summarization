SUMMARY: Donald Trump has responded to criticism from Barack Obama following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, which left 31 people dead. Obama, in his first public statement since the shootings, called for Americans to reject leaders who normalize racist sentiments and incite fear and hatred. Trump, citing a Fox & Friends segment, defended himself by claiming Obama also had mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced criticism for blaming video games and mental illness for the shootings, while not addressing gun control. The El Paso shooter allegedly posted a racist screed echoing Trump's rhetoric. Trump is expected to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, despite opposition from Democrats like Beto O'Rourke, who believe Trump's presence would be divisive. Obama's statement indirectly referred to Trump's normalization of racism and demonization of immigrants. Trump has recently made controversial statements about congresswomen of color and majority-minority districts.
END OF SUMMARY.
