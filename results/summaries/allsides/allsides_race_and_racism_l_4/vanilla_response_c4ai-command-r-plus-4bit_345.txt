SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's statement about the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, where he called for Americans to reject leaders who promote fear and hatred. Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment that claimed Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency and that Obama was not criticized for it. Trump has faced criticism for blaming video games and mental illness for the shootings instead of addressing gun control. The El Paso shooter allegedly posted a racist screed featuring language similar to Trump's rhetoric. Trump plans to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, despite opposition from Democrats like Beto O'Rourke, who believe Trump's rhetoric contributed to the tragedy. Obama's statement called for Americans to reject racist language and normalize the demonization of immigrants, which many interpreted as a reference to Trump's past statements. Trump has tempered his criticism of white supremacy but continues to stoke racial resentment in his rhetoric. 

END OF SUMMARY.
