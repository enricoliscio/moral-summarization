Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump and Barack Obama's recent statements regarding mass shootings and the political climate in the US. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Trump responded to Obama's statement about mass shootings. Obama didn't mention Trump directly but criticized the normalization of fear, hate, and racism. He emphasized the need for accountability in changing gun laws. Trump, on the other hand, cited a Fox & Friends segment that compared the number of mass shootings under Obama to Bush's administration. Trump has been criticized for not addressing gun control and instead pointing to video games, the internet, and mental illness as causes. Additionally, Trump's statements have been accused of emboldening white nationalists. The El Paso shooter's manifesto included language similar to Trump's, and the attack targeted a Hispanic-majority area. Trump is planning to visit the sites, but some Democrats, like Beto O’Rourke, are opposing this visit, calling it unnecessary division. Obama's comments were cautious but clearly alluded to Trump's rhetoric. Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions, including tweets about congresswomen of color and negative remarks about Baltimore. He did, however, condemn racism and white supremacy in a recent speech and mentioned directing the FBI to address domestic terrorism.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the main points: Trump's response to Obama, the comparison of mass shootings, Trump's critics, the El Paso attack's context, the political divide, and the broader implications of their statements.

I should structure the summary to first mention Obama's call for rejecting fear and hate, then Trump's response using the Fox & Friends segment. Highlight Trump's critics and the El Paso attack's context, including the manifesto and the opposition to Trump's visit. Then, touch on Obama's cautious but pointed remarks and Trump's recent actions regarding race and his own condemnations.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, covers all key points without getting too detailed, and stays within the word limit. Let me try drafting it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds necessary information without redundancy.
