SUMMARY: 
Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, where 31 people were killed. Obama urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that "feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalises racist sentiments" and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment, quoting host Brian Kilmeade, who said Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency, implying that Obama did not face criticism for them. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing guns as the cause of the shootings, and for emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. The suspect in the El Paso attack posted a racist, anti-immigrant screed featuring language used by Trump shortly before the rampage. Obama called on Americans to reject the normalisation of racism, which has "been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history". Trump's rhetoric has been accused of stoking racial resentments, and his visit to El Paso and Dayton has been met with opposition from Democrats.
