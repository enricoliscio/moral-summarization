Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, and the responses from former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump.

First, Obama made a statement criticizing the language that fosters fear, hatred, and racism, without mentioning Trump directly. He emphasized the need for accountability in changing gun laws. Then, Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which pointed out that there were 32 mass shootings during Obama's presidency. Trump has been criticized for not addressing gun control and for his statements that some link to white nationalism. The El Paso shooter's manifesto had language similar to Trump's, and Trump is planning to visit the sites, but some, like Beto O'Rourke, oppose this visit.

The article also mentions that Obama avoided directly criticizing Trump but clearly referred to him, especially regarding Trump's comments on immigrants and race. Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions, and his recent actions, like tweets about congresswomen, have been seen as divisive.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Obama's statement, Trump's response, the criticism of Trump's handling of gun issues and racial remarks, the planned visit, and the broader context of their exchanges.

I should make sure to include that Obama didn't mention Trump but clearly alluded to him, and Trump's counter with the Fox segment. Also, the link between Trump's statements and the shooter's manifesto, and the political responses to Trump's planned visit.

I'll structure it to flow from Obama's statement, Trump's response, the criticism, and the implications. Keeping it concise and covering all main points without going into too much detail.
