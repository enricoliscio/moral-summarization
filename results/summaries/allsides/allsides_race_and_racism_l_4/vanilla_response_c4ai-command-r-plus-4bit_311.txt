SUMMARY: Donald Trump has responded to criticism from Barack Obama following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. Obama, in his first public statement since the shootings, called on Americans to reject leaders who promote fear, hatred, and racist sentiments. While not mentioning Trump by name, Obama impliedly criticized Trump's rhetoric, which has been accused of emboldening white nationalists. Trump, in turn, cited a Fox & Friends segment that defended him by claiming Obama also had mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun control and for his own racist statements, which investigators say were echoed by the El Paso shooter. Beto O'Rourke and other Democrats opposed Trump's planned visit to El Paso and Dayton, arguing that Trump's rhetoric contributed to the tragedy. Obama's statement called on Americans to reject normalization of racism and hold leaders accountable for changing gun laws. Obama's comments highlighted the trend of white supremacy and the demonization of immigrants, which have been recurring themes in Trump's rhetoric. 

END OF SUMMARY.
