SUMMARY:
Former President Barack Obama urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that feeds a climate of fear and hatred, following the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. He emphasized that the country's high frequency of mass shootings can be changed if public officials are held accountable for changing gun laws. In response, President Donald Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment, quoting that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign, without mentioning Trump's own rhetoric that has been accused of emboldening white nationalists. Trump has faced criticism for identifying video games, the internet, and mental illness as the cause of the slaughter, but not guns. Obama's statement referred to Trump's language that has been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history, including racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. Trump's visit to El Paso and Dayton has been met with opposition from Democrats, who argue that he has no place in the cities he has helped to divide. END OF SUMMARY.
