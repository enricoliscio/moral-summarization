Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump responding to Obama's statement regarding mass shootings. Obama criticized the normalization of racist sentiments without mentioning Trump directly. Trump countered by citing Fox & Friends, mentioning the number of mass shootings during Obama's presidency. The article also talks about Trump's focus on video games and mental illness instead of guns, his emboldening of white nationalists, and the criticism from Beto O'Rourke.

Next, I need to identify the key moral terms from the list provided. Words like shootings, fear, hatred, normalizes, racist, dead, accountable, tragedies, emboldening, attack, anti-immigrant, rampage, killed, massacre, division, heal, condemn, racism, stoking, etc.

I should structure the summary to include these terms while keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump's response to Obama, then move to the context of the shootings, Trump's criticism, and the moral implications like emboldening white nationalists. I'll also include Obama's caution and the criticism of Trump's rhetoric.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically and includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and concise.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the key points and the moral framing words. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. 

Wait, I should also make sure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and the moral perspective presented. I need to balance the inclusion of terms with the clarity of the summary. Maybe I can group related points together, like Trump's response and the context of the shootings, followed by the criticism and moral implications.

I think I have a good structure in mind. Now, I'll put it all together, ensuring that the moral terms are naturally integrated into the summary.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's criticism of leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred or normalise racist sentiments" by citing Fox & Friends, noting that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced criticism for linking mass shootings to video games, the internet, and mental illness, rather than addressing gun laws. He has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists through racist statements. The El Paso shooter posted a racist, anti-immigrant attack before the rampage, targeting a majority Hispanic city. Trump plans to visit El Paso and Dayton, but Beto O'Rourke opposes his visit, stating Trump helped create the hatred behind the tragedy. Obama warned against leaders who demonise others, calling such language a root of human tragedy. Trump has stoked racial resentments, including tweets targeting congresswomen of colour and deriding African American districts. The article highlights the moral framing of shootings, fear, hatred, racism, and the need to reject divisive rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
