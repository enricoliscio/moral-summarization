SUMMARY:

Former President Barack Obama condemned the language of leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred or normalise racist sentiments" in the wake of two mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. While not directly mentioning President Trump, Obama's statement implied that Trump's rhetoric has contributed to the normalization of racism and the high frequency of mass shootings in the US. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment that claimed Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency, implying that Obama was not held accountable for them. However, Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun laws and for emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. The El Paso shooter's racist screed featured language used by Trump, and Trump's visit to El Paso was met with opposition from Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, who argued that Trump's presence would only bring more division. Obama's statement emphasized the need to reject language that demonizes certain groups and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
