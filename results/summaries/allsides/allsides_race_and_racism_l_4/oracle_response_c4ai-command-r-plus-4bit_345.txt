SUMMARY: Donald Trump has been criticized for his response to recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, which left 31 people dead and many more injured. Barack Obama, in his first public statement since the shootings, called on Americans to reject leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred" and "normalize racist sentiments". Obama's statement did not mention Trump by name but emphasized the need for accountability and changing gun laws to prevent future tragedies. In response, Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment that defended him and criticized Obama's record on mass shootings. Trump has been accused of emboldening white nationalists with his racist statements and of identifying factors other than guns as the cause of the slaughter. The El Paso shooting suspect posted a racist screed echoing Trump's language shortly before the attack. Trump's visit to El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, has been opposed by Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, who stated that Trump "helped create the hatred that made Saturday's tragedy possible". Obama's statement condemned racism and white supremacy, and called on Americans to denounce leaders who demonize immigrants and people of color. Trump's recent rhetoric has been criticized for stoking racial resentments and promoting division.
