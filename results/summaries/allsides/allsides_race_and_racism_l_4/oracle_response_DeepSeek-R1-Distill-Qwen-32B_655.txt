Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the key points of the article. It's about Trump responding to Obama's statement regarding mass shootings and the moral implications of their rhetoric.

The user wants a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. I need to make sure to include words like shootings, fear, hatred, normalizes, racist, accountable, etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words.

I'll start by identifying the main events: Obama's criticism of Trump's rhetoric, Trump's counter with Fox & Friends, the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, Trump's response, and the political implications.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues each side is raising. Trump is accused of stoking fear and hatred, while Obama is cautioning against normalizing racism. I'll make sure to include the specific accusations and the consequences mentioned, like the El Paso attack being linked to Trump's language.

I need to keep the summary clear and to the point, ensuring that all the key morally charged terms are included without making it too lengthy. I'll also mention the criticism Trump has received for not addressing gun laws and for emboldening white nationalists.

Finally, I'll end with the political divide and the call for accountability, tying back to the moral framing. Let me piece this together concisely, making sure each sentence captures the essence without losing the moral context.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's criticism of his rhetoric, which Obama argued "feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalises racist sentiments." Obama's statement, following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 dead and 53 injured, urged accountability for changing gun laws to prevent future tragedies. Trump countered by citing Fox & Friends, noting Obama's presidency saw 32 mass shootings, while Bush did not condemn Obama after Sandy Hook. Trump has been criticized for blaming video games and mental illness instead of guns, and for emboldening white nationalists. The El Paso shooter posted a racist, anti-immigrant attack linked to Trump's language. Trump plans to visit the shooting sites, but Democrats, including Beto Oâ€™Rourke, oppose his visit, arguing he has "no place" there. Obama warned against leaders who "demonise" others or suggest immigrants threaten American life, linking such language to human tragedy. Trump has stoked racial resentments, including tweets about congresswomen and a rally chant of "send her back." He also derided a Baltimore district as a "disgusting mess." Obama emphasized the need to reject language that "preserve[s] white supremacy" and called for unity to heal, while Trump's rhetoric has been accused of dividing the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
