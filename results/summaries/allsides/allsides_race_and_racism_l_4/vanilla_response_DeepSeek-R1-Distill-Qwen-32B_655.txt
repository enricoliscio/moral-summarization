Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Donald Trump responding to Barack Obama's comments regarding mass shootings. Obama criticized the normalization of racist sentiments without mentioning Trump directly. Trump then cited a Fox & Friends segment, pointing out that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. 

The article also mentions Trump's criticism of video games and mental illness as causes, rather than guns. There's mention of the El Paso shooter's racist screed, which used Trump's language. Beto O'Rourke opposed Trump's visit, saying he shouldn't come because he fueled hatred. 

Obama's statement was cautious but clearly referenced Trump's rhetoric. Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions, like telling congresswomen to "go back" and deriding Baltimore. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Obama's criticism, Trump's response with the Fox & Friends quote, the context of the shootings, Trump's focus on causes other than guns, the El Paso shooter's ties to Trump's language, O'Rourke's opposition, and Obama's indirect but clear reference to Trump's rhetoric. Also, include Trump's recent actions stoking racial tensions.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting bogged down in details. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each sentence adds a new piece of information without repetition.
