SUMMARY:
Former President Barack Obama urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that "feeds a climate of fear and hatred" and "normalises racist sentiments" in the wake of two mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. Obama's statement did not directly mention President Trump, but Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment that downplayed the frequency of mass shootings during Obama's presidency. Trump has faced criticism for identifying video games, the internet, and mental illness as the causes of the shootings, rather than guns. He has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. Obama warned that "language coming out of the mouths of some of our leaders" has "been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history" and has "no place in our politics and our public life". Trump's visit to El Paso and Dayton has been met with opposition from Democrats, who argue that he has no place in the cities he has helped to divide. END OF SUMMARY.
