SUMMARY: 
Former president Barack Obama released a statement in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. Obama's statement, while not mentioning Trump directly, called on Americans to "soundly reject language" from any leader who promotes a climate of fear, hatred, or racist sentiments. He emphasized that Americans are not helpless in the face of frequent mass shootings and urged public officials to be held accountable for changing gun laws. Trump, in response, quoted a Fox & Friends segment that criticized Obama for not being condemned after the Sandy Hook shooting and highlighted the 32 mass shootings that occurred during his presidency. Trump has been *criticized* for failing to acknowledge the role of guns in the recent *slaughter* and for his *emboldening* of white nationalists through his *racist* statements. The El Paso shooter's *rampage* was reportedly influenced by Trump's rhetoric. Despite facing *accusations* of division and hate, Trump is expected to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, although some Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, have opposed his visit. Obama's statement condemned the normalization of *racism* and *white supremacy*, calling on Americans to reject leaders who *demonize* those of different backgrounds. He highlighted the *tragedy's* root in *human* *resentments* and the need to heal from divisive language. Trump's recent rhetoric, including his *resentments* toward congresswomen of color and his *description* of Baltimore as "infested," has been widely seen as contributing to a climate of fear and *hatred*.
