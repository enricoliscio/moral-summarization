SUMMARY: Former president Barack Obama issued a public statement after the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, urging Americans to reject leaders who promote fear, hatred, and racist sentiments. Obama's statement implicitly referred to Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric, which has been accused of emboldening white nationalists. Trump, in response, cited a Fox & Friends segment that defended him by claiming Obama also had mass shootings during his presidency. Beto O'Rourke and other Democrats opposed Trump's planned visit to El Paso and Dayton, arguing that Trump's rhetoric contributed to the hatred that led to the tragedy. Obama's statement called for the rejection of racist language and the normalization of white supremacy, indirectly criticizing Trump's inflammatory remarks about immigrants and people of color. Trump, despite tempering his criticism of white supremacy in the past, has recently directed the FBI to address domestic terrorism and condemned racism and bigotry in scripted remarks. The moral framing of the article revolves around the ethical responsibility of leaders in addressing gun violence and promoting unity, rather than divisiveness and hatred.
