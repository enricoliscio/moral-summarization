Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. They want the summary to include as many of those words as possible, without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump responding to Obama's statement regarding mass shootings and the moral implications of their words. 

I notice the article mentions Trump citing Fox & Friends, comparing Obama's presidency to mass shootings. Obama's statement is about rejecting fear and hatred, holding officials accountable for gun laws. Trump is criticized for not addressing guns and emboldening white nationalists. The shootings in El Paso and Dayton are highlighted, along with Beto O'Rourke's opposition to Trump's visit. 

I need to make sure to include all the morally charged words from the list. Words like shootings, fear, hatred, normalizes, racist, dead, accountable, changing, tragedies, injured, emboldening, attack, anti-immigrant, rampage, killed, massacre, heal, division, etc. 

I should structure the summary to cover the key points: Obama's call for accountability, Trump's response, the criticism of Trump's rhetoric, the impact of his words on the shootings, and the public reaction. 

I'll start by mentioning Obama's statement, then Trump's response, followed by the criticism against Trump, the shootings, and the aftermath. I'll make sure to include the moral terms as much as possible without making the summary too lengthy. 

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, checking off each moral term as I include them. 

Wait, I should also mention the specific shootings and the locations, as well as the political implications, like Beto O'Rourke's opposition. That adds context to the moral framing. 

I think I've covered all the main points and included the necessary moral terms. Let me read through it again to ensure it's concise and meets the word limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's call to reject language that "feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalises racist sentiments" by citing a Fox & Friends segment that claimed Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama urged accountability for changing gun laws to prevent future tragedies, while Trump has been criticised for blaming video games, the internet, and mental illness instead of addressing guns. Trump has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists through racist statements, as the El Paso shooter posted a racist, anti-immigrant screed echoing Trump's rhetoric. Obama linked the El Paso shooting to a trend of individuals embracing ideologies that promote violence to preserve white supremacy, urging Americans to denounce leaders who demonise others or suggest immigrants threaten their way of life. Trump has faced backlash for stoking racial resentments, including tweets targeting four congresswomen of colour and deriding a Baltimore district as a "disgusting mess." The article highlights the moral implications of their words, with Obama calling for unity and healing, while Trump's rhetoric has been seen as creating division and normalising racism. END OF SUMMARY.
