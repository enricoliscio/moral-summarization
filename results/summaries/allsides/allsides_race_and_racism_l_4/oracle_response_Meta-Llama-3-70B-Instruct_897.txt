SUMMARY: 

Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings, which did not directly mention Trump but urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that "feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalises racist sentiments". Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment, quoting host Brian Kilmeade as saying Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement emphasized the need for accountability and changing gun laws to prevent tragedies. Trump has faced criticism for identifying video games, the internet, and mental illness as the cause of the slaughter, but not guns. He has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. The suspect in the El Paso attack posted a racist, anti-immigrant screed featuring language used by Trump. Obama advised Americans to reject the normalisation of racism, which has been "at the root of most human tragedy throughout history". Trump's visit to El Paso and Dayton has been met with opposition, with critics arguing he has no place there.
