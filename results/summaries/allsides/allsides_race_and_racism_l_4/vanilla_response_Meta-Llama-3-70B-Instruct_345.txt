SUMMARY:

Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings, citing a Fox & Friends segment that mentioned Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement did not directly mention Trump, but urged Americans to reject language that feeds fear and hatred, and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun control and for emboldening white nationalists through his rhetoric. The suspect in the El Paso attack posted a racist screed featuring language used by Trump before the rampage. Trump is set to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, despite opposition from Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, who say the president should not visit due to his divisive rhetoric. Obama's comments were seen as a veiled criticism of Trump, who has spoken disparagingly about immigrants and has tempered his criticism of white supremacy.

END OF SUMMARY.
