Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants a summary of a news article, but with a specific focus on preserving the moral framing that the author used. They provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I need to understand the article's content. It's about Trump responding to Obama's comments on mass shootings and the role of leadership in addressing gun violence and racism. The article also touches on Trump's past statements and actions that have been criticized for emboldening white nationalists and stoking racial tensions.

The user emphasized preserving the moral framing, so I should make sure to include words like "shooting," "hatred," "racist," "tragedies," "slaughter," "emboldening," "attack," etc. These words carry strong moral connotations and are crucial for maintaining the article's tone.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll have to identify the key points: Obama's criticism of Trump's leadership and rhetoric, Trump's response citing mass shootings during Obama's presidency, the criticism of Trump's focus on video games instead of gun laws, the El Paso and Dayton shootings, and the political implications of Trump's visit.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues at play, such as the normalization of racism, the emboldening of white supremacists, and the impact of leadership on societal divisions. It's important to show how both leaders are framing the issues, with Obama emphasizing accountability and Trump deflecting blame.

I'll make sure to include the key events and the moral language used, ensuring that the summary reflects the article's critical perspective on Trump's handling of these issues. I'll also need to mention the criticism of Trump's visit and the broader implications for national unity.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all the morally framed words are appropriately included without making the summary too verbose. The goal is to capture the essence of the article while maintaining its moral tone and key points.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's criticism of his leadership and rhetoric, which Obama tied to a "climate of fear and hatred" and "racist sentiments." Obama called on Americans to reject such language and hold leaders accountable for addressing gun laws, linking mass shootings to a failure to act. Trump countered by citing Fox & Friends, noting 32 mass shootings during Obama's presidency, while deflecting blame onto video games and mental illness, avoiding mention of guns. Critics accuse Trump of emboldening white nationalists through racist statements, as seen in the El Paso shooter's anti-immigrant screed. Trump is set to visit El Paso and Dayton, but Democrats, including Beto Oâ€™Rourke, oppose his visit, arguing he has "no place" there due to his role in "helping create the hatred" behind the tragedies. Obama emphasized the link between violent ideologies and leaders who "demonise" others, urging rejection of such language to prevent future "tragedies." Trump has faced criticism for stoking racial resentments, including his controversial tweets about congresswomen and deriding minority neighborhoods. The article highlights the moral framing of mass shootings, racism, and leadership's role in either healing or exacerbating division. END OF SUMMARY.
