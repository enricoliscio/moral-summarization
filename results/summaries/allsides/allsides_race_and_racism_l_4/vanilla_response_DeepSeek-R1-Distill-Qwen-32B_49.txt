Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a conflict between Donald Trump and Barack Obama regarding mass shootings and political statements. 

First, Obama made a statement criticizing the normalization of fear, hate, and racism, without mentioning Trump directly. Trump responded by citing Fox & Friends, mentioning Obama's presidency had 32 mass shootings. 

I should note that Trump is being criticized for not addressing gun laws and for his statements that some say embolden white nationalists. The El Paso shooter had a racist manifesto, and Trump is visiting the sites, but some oppose his visit. 

Obama's cautious approach but clear reference to Trump's rhetoric. Trump's recent actions, like the "send her back" rally, are part of the context. 

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: Obama's criticism, Trump's response, the shootings, Trump's criticism of gun laws, the El Paso visit, and the broader context of Trump's rhetoric. 

Let me structure it: Start with Obama's statement, Trump's response, mention the shootings, Trump's stance on causes, the visit and opposition, and conclude with the ongoing debate on rhetoric and gun control. 

Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit. Avoid unnecessary details, focus on the main elements. 

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise manner without exceeding 200 words.
