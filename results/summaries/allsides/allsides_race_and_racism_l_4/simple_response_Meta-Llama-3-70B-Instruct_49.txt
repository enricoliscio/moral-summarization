SUMMARY:

Former President Barack Obama condemned the language of leaders who promote fear, hatred, and racism, indirectly criticizing President Trump's rhetoric. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which claimed that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency, implying that Obama did not face similar criticism. However, Obama's statement emphasized the need to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws to prevent mass shootings. Trump has been criticized for blaming video games, the internet, and mental illness, rather than guns, for the recent massacres. He has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements, which were echoed in the El Paso shooter's manifesto. Obama urged Americans to reject language that demonizes immigrants and minorities, which has been at the root of most human tragedies throughout history.
