Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The article is about Donald Trump's response to Barack Obama's statement regarding mass shootings and the moral implications of their statements.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Obama criticized the normalization of racist sentiments without mentioning Trump directly, but it's implied. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment that criticized Obama's record on mass shootings. Trump has been accused of not addressing gun laws and instead pointing to video games and mental illness. He's also been criticized for emboldening white nationalists with his statements.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral framing. That means highlighting the ethical implications of their actions and statements. For example, Obama's concern about rhetoric leading to violence and Trump's criticism of gun control while promoting other causes. Also, the mention of Trump's visit to El Paso being opposed by Beto O'Rourke adds context about the political divide.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. I'll start by stating Obama's criticism, Trump's response, the accusations against Trump, and the political reaction. I'll make sure to include the moral aspects, like how language can incite violence and the divide Trump's statements create.

I'll structure it as: Obama's statement, Trump's response, the accusations against Trump, the political opposition to his visit, and the broader implications of their rhetoric on American unity and gun laws.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear, concise, and maintains the moral perspective from the original article.

SUMMARY: Former President Barack Obama criticized the normalization of racist sentiments in the wake of recent mass shootings, indirectly targeting Donald Trump. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment questioning Obama's record on mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun laws, instead blaming video games and mental illness, while also being accused of emboldening white nationalists through his rhetoric. The suspect in the El Paso shooting posted a racist manifesto resembling Trump's language. Trump plans to visit the shooting sites, but Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, oppose his visit, arguing he contributes to division. Obama emphasized the dangers of leaders demonizing others and urged Americans to reject such language, linking it to historical tragedies. Trump has recently stoked racial tensions, further polarizing the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
