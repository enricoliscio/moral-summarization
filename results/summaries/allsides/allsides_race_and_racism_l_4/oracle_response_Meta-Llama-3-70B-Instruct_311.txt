SUMMARY:

Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings in the US, where Obama urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that feeds fear and hatred, and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment, quoting that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency, implying that Obama did not face criticism for them. However, Trump has been accused of emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements, and of not addressing the root cause of the shootings, instead blaming video games and mental illness. The El Paso shooting, which killed 22 people, is suspected to be motivated by racism, with the suspect posting a racist screed featuring language used by Trump. Obama's statement condemned the normalisation of racism, calling on Americans to reject language that demonises immigrants and suggests they threaten the country's way of life. Trump's visit to El Paso has been opposed by Democrats, who argue that he has no place there after helping to create the hatred that led to the tragedy.
