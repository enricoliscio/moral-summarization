SUMMARY:

Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which claimed Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement called on Americans to "soundly reject language" that feeds a climate of fear and hatred, and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump, however, has faced criticism for identifying video games, the internet, and mental illness as the cause of the recent shootings, rather than guns. He has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements, which have been linked to the El Paso attack. Obama's statement condemned the normalisation of racism, which he said has been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history. Trump's response has been met with opposition, with many arguing that he has no place in El Paso, a city that has been affected by his divisive rhetoric.
