SUMMARY: Former president Barack Obama indirectly criticized Donald Trump for his racist rhetoric and lack of action on gun control following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 dead. Obama emphasized the need to reject leaders who promote fear, hatred, and racism, while Trump deflected criticism by citing a Fox & Friends segment that blamed Obama for mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced backlash for blaming video games and mental illness instead of addressing gun control and for emboldening white nationalists with his racist statements. Beto O'Rourke and other Democrats opposed Trump's planned visit to El Paso and Dayton, arguing that Trump's divisive rhetoric contributed to the hatred that fueled the tragedies. Obama's statement highlighted the need to denounce racist and dehumanizing language, while Trump has continued to stoke racial resentment and normalize racism.
