SUMMARY: Donald Trump has hit back at Barack Obama, who criticized leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred and normalize racist sentiments" in the wake of the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. Obama's statement did not mention Trump directly, but called on Americans to stand up and hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump, however, cited a Fox & Friends segment that defended him by claiming Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced criticism for blaming video games and mental illness instead of guns for the slaughter. He has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists with his racist statements. The El Paso shooter posted a racist screed echoing Trump's language. Beto O'Rourke and other Democrats opposed Trump's planned visit to El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, saying that Trump has "no place" in the communities healing from these tragedies. Obama's statement condemned racism, white supremacy, and the demonization of immigrants, sentiments that Trump has repeatedly stoked in his rhetoric and policies.
END OF SUMMARY.
