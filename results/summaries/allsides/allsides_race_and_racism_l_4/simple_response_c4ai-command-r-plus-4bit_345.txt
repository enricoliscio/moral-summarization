SUMMARY: In the wake of the tragic mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that claimed 31 lives, former President Barack Obama issued a statement urging Americans to reject leaders who foster fear, hatred, and racist sentiments. Obama emphasized the need to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring. In response, President Donald Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment, deflecting blame and stating that mass shootings occurred during Obama's presidency as well. Trump has faced criticism for failing to acknowledge the role of guns in these incidents and for emboldening white nationalists with his own racist rhetoric. The El Paso shooter's manifesto echoed Trump's language, and Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, opposed Trump's planned visit to El Paso and Dayton, arguing that Trump's divisive rhetoric contributed to the hateful atmosphere that enabled the tragedy. Obama's statement called for a rejection of racist language and the normalization of white supremacy, indirectly referencing Trump's inflammatory remarks about immigrants and people of color. Trump, meanwhile, has attempted to shift the blame to video games, the internet, and mental illness, avoiding any mention of gun control. 

END OF SUMMARY.
