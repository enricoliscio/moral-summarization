SUMMARY: Donald Trump has been criticized for his response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, which left 31 people dead and many more injured. While Barack Obama, in his first public statement since the tragedies, called on Americans to reject leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred" and "normalize racist sentiments," Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment that defended him by claiming Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced backlash for failing to identify guns as the cause of the slaughter and for emboldening white nationalists with his racist statements. The El Paso shooter's anti-immigrant screed echoed language used by Trump, and many believe the President's rhetoric helped create the hatred that led to the attack. Trump is expected to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, despite opposition from Democrats like Beto O'Rourke, who believes Trump's presence will only cause more division. Obama's statement encouraged Americans to denounce leaders who demonize immigrants and refer to others as subhuman, sentiments that have been echoed by Trump in recent months as he has stoked racial resentments.
END OF SUMMARY.
