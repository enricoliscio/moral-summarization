SUMMARY:

Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings in the US, citing a Fox & Friends segment that claimed Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement did not directly mention Trump, but urged Americans to reject language that feeds fear and hatred, and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun control and for emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. The suspect in the El Paso attack posted a racist screed featuring language used by Trump before the rampage. Trump is expected to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, but some Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, oppose the visit, saying Trump has no place in El Paso.

END OF SUMMARY.
