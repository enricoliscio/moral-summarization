SUMMARY:

Former President Barack Obama condemned the language of fear, hatred, and racism that has become normalized in the US, indirectly referencing President Trump's rhetoric. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, claiming that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency without being criticized. However, Obama's statement emphasized the need for accountability and change in gun laws to prevent such tragedies. Trump, on the other hand, has been criticized for blaming video games, the internet, and mental illness, while emboldening white nationalists with his racist statements. The El Paso shooting suspect's racist screed featured language used by Trump, and Democrats like Beto O'Rourke have opposed Trump's visit to El Paso, citing his role in creating the hatred that led to the tragedy. Obama's call to reject racism and bigotry is a moral imperative, as such language has been at the root of most human tragedies throughout history.
