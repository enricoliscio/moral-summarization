SUMMARY:

Former President Barack Obama called on Americans to "soundly reject language" from leaders who promote fear, hatred, and racism, in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. Obama's statement did not directly mention President Trump, but Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment that downplayed Obama's own record on mass shootings. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun control and for emboldening white nationalists through his rhetoric. The El Paso shooting suspect's racist manifesto featured language similar to Trump's, and Democrats have accused Trump of creating a climate of hatred. Obama urged Americans to denounce language that demonizes immigrants and minorities, saying it has "no place in our politics and our public life." Trump's response to the shootings has been widely criticized, and his visit to El Paso has been opposed by some Democrats.
