Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article talks about Trump and Obama's responses to recent mass shootings. I should focus on the key points: Obama's criticism of Trump's rhetoric, Trump's counter with Fox & Friends, the criticism of Trump's gun policy stance, and the context of the shootings. I'll make sure to highlight the moral implications, like Trump's role in emboldening hate and Obama's caution. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Let me start by identifying the main events and the moral arguments presented. Then, I'll condense each point into concise sentences, ensuring the summary flows logically. I'll also make sure to mention the shootings' details and the political implications without getting too detailed. Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's criticism of his handling of mass shootings by citing a Fox & Friends segment, claiming Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement, following the Texas and Ohio shootings, urged Americans to reject leaders who normalize fear, hatred, or racism, indirectly targeting Trump. Trump has been accused of avoiding gun control discussions and emboldening white nationalists through racist statements. The El Paso shooter reportedly used Trump-like language, and Trump's recent rhetoric, including calling for four congresswomen to "go back" to their countries, has stoked racial tensions. Obama emphasized the need to denounce leaders who demonize others, linking such language to historical tragedies. Trump plans to visit the shooting sites, but Democrats, including Beto Oâ€™Rourke, oppose his visit, arguing he exacerbates division. The shootings highlight the ongoing debate over gun control, rhetoric, and responsibility in addressing violence. END OF SUMMARY.
