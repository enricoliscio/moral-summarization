SUMMARY:
Former President Barack Obama urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that promotes a "climate of fear and hatred" and "normalises racist sentiments" in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. He emphasized that the country's high frequency of mass shootings can be changed if public officials are held accountable for changing gun laws. President Donald Trump, however, cited a Fox & Friends segment to deflect criticism, quoting that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced criticism for identifying video games, the internet, and mental illness as the cause of the shootings, rather than guns. He has also been accused of emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements, which have been linked to the El Paso attack. Obama's statement called for Americans to reject the language of leaders who "demonise those who donâ€™t look like us" and promote "racism, bigotry and white supremacy". END OF SUMMARY.
