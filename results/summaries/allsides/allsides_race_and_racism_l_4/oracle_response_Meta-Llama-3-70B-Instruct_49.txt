SUMMARY:

Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which claimed that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that "feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalises racist sentiments." He emphasized the need to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws to prevent tragedies. Trump, however, has been criticized for identifying video games, the internet, and mental illness as the cause of the slaughter, while emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. The El Paso attack suspect posted a racist, anti-immigrant screed featuring language used by Trump, and Trump's visit to El Paso was met with opposition from Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, who argued that Trump's presence would create more division. Obama's comments condemned the normalisation of racism and urged Americans to reject language that demonises others, suggesting that such language has been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history.

END OF SUMMARY.
