SUMMARY: 
Former president Barack Obama issued a statement in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, urging Americans to "soundly reject language" from leaders who promote a climate of fear, hatred, and racism. Obama's comments were interpreted as a veiled critique of Donald Trump, who has faced fierce criticism for his divisive rhetoric and failure to condemn white nationalism. Trump, citing a Fox & Friends segment, countered by claiming that mass shootings occurred during Obama's presidency as well and that Obama was not labeled as "out of control." Trump has been accused of emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements, with the El Paso shooter echoing Trump's language in an anti-immigrant screed. Despite Trump's attempts to shift blame to video games and mental illness, Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, opposed his visit to El Paso, citing his role in creating a hateful and divisive atmosphere. Obama called for Americans to denounce racist and divisive language from leaders, noting that demonizing immigrants and normalizing racist sentiments have been at the root of human tragedies. He urged public officials to be held accountable for changing gun laws to prevent future massacres. Obama's statement highlighted the need to address racism, bigotry, and domestic terrorism, while also emphasizing the tragic consequences of divisive and dangerous rhetoric. END OF SUMMARY.
