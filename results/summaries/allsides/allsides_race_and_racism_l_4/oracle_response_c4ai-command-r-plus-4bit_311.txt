SUMMARY: Donald Trump has responded to criticism from Barack Obama regarding the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, which left 31 people dead. Obama's statement, while not mentioning Trump directly, called on Americans to reject leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred" and normalise racist sentiments. Trump, citing a Fox & Friends segment, countered by saying that Obama also had mass shootings during his presidency and was not condemned in the same way. Trump has faced criticism for blaming video games and mental illness for the shootings, rather than addressing gun control. The El Paso shooting suspect's racist, anti-immigrant screed echoed language used by Trump, leading to accusations that Trump has emboldened white nationalists. Obama's statement advised Americans to denounce leaders who demonise and dehumanise others, and Trump's recent rhetoric has been widely criticised as racist and divisive. Trump is expected to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, despite opposition from some Democrats who believe his presence will hinder the healing process.
END OF SUMMARY.
