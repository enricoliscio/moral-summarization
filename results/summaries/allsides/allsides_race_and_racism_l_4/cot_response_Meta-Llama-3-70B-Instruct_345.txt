SUMMARY:
Former President Barack Obama called on Americans to "soundly reject language" that feeds a climate of fear and hatred, following the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. Obama's statement did not mention President Trump directly, but urged Americans to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which quoted Obama's presidency as having 32 mass shootings. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing guns as the cause of the slaughter, and for emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. Obama's comments were seen as a direct rebuke of Trump's language, which has been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history. Trump's visit to El Paso and Dayton was met with opposition from Democrats, who argued that he had no place there. END OF SUMMARY.
