Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Donald Trump responding to Barack Obama's comments about mass shootings. Obama criticized the normalization of fear, hate, and racism without mentioning Trump directly. Trump then cited a Fox & Friends segment, pointing out that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. The author seems critical of Trump, mentioning his focus on video games and mental illness instead of gun laws, and his emboldening of white nationalists. There's also mention of the El Paso shooting suspect's racist screed using Trump's language. Beto O'Rourke opposes Trump's visit, saying he shouldn't come because he contributed to the hatred. The article also notes that Obama's comments were a subtle criticism of Trump, especially regarding his racist statements and the trend of white supremacy in shootings.

So, the moral framing here is that Trump is blamed for contributing to a climate of fear, hate, and racism, leading to mass shootings. The author is critical of Trump's approach and his statements, which are seen as exacerbating the problem. I need to make sure the summary reflects this criticism and the moral implications without adding my own opinions.

I should structure the summary to include key points: Obama's criticism, Trump's response, the statistics on shootings, Trump's focus on non-gun causes, the El Paso suspect's connection to Trump's language, Beto O'Rourke's opposition, and the trend of white supremacy in shootings. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral tone is preserved.

Let me draft a summary that hits all these points succinctly, ensuring the critical tone towards Trump is clear. I'll avoid any markdown and just present the summary as per the instructions.
