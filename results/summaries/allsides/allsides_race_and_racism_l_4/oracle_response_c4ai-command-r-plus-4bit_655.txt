SUMMARY: Donald Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment to hit back at Barack Obama's statement following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. Obama's statement called for Americans to reject leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred" and "normalize racist sentiments". Trump quoted the segment which stated that Obama also had mass shootings during his presidency and that "not many people said Obama is out of control". Trump has faced criticism for blaming video games and mental illness for the slaughter, rather than guns. The El Paso shooter posted a racist screed mirroring Trump's language, but Trump denied emboldening white nationalists. Beto O'Rourke opposed Trump's visit to El Paso, stating that Trump "helped create the hatred that made Saturday's tragedy possible". Obama's statement also highlighted the need to reject the normalisation of racism and white supremacy, and to condemn leaders who demonise immigrants and people of colour. Trump has been accused of stoking racial resentments with his rhetoric.
END OF SUMMARY.
