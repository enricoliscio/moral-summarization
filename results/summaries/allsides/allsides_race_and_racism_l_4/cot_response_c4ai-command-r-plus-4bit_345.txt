SUMMARY: In response to mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead, Barack Obama issued a statement urging Americans to reject leaders who *feed a climate of fear and *hatred or *normalize *racist *sentiments. Obama's comments came after *criticism that Donald Trump has *emboldened *white nationalists through his *racist statements. Trump, in turn, cited a Fox & Friends segment defending himself and blaming video games and mental illness for the shootings. Beto O'Rourke and other Democrats opposed Trump's visit to El Paso, stating that the president has no place in a community he has helped to divide. Obama's statement called on Americans to *condemn the *language of *leaders who *demonize those from different backgrounds and referred to the *tragedy in El Paso as a result of *racist *ideologies. The El Paso shooter posted a *racist screed echoing Trump's language, highlighting the *resentments and *fears that have been stoked by the president's rhetoric. The *tragedy has left Americans *mourning and searching for answers to prevent future *massacres.
END OF SUMMARY.
