SUMMARY:

Former President Barack Obama has spoken out against the language of fear and hatred, indirectly criticizing President Donald Trump's rhetoric. Obama's statement came after two mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which claimed that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency and that not many people said Obama was "out of control". Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun laws and for emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. The suspect in the El Paso attack posted a racist screed featuring language used by Trump before the rampage. Trump is expected to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, but some Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, have opposed the visit, saying Trump has no place in El Paso.
