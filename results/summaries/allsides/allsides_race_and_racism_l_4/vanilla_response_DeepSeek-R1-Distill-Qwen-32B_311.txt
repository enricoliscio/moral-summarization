Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about Trump responding to Obama's statement regarding the recent mass shootings. Obama didn't mention Trump directly but criticized the normalization of fear and hatred. Trump, in response, cited a Fox & Friends segment that pointed out there were 32 mass shootings during Obama's presidency. 

I should note that Trump has been criticized for not addressing gun laws and instead blaming video games and mental illness. Also, the suspect in El Paso used Trump's language, which is a key point. 

Obama's statement is cautious but clearly targets Trump's rhetoric, especially regarding immigrants. Trump's recent actions, like the "send her back" rally, are relevant here. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Trump's response, Obama's criticism, the context of the shootings, and the broader issues of gun control and rhetoric.

Let me structure this: start with Trump's response, mention the shootings, touch on gun control criticism, include the suspect's connection to Trump's language, and end with Obama's broader criticism and Trump's recent actions.

I should make sure it's concise and covers all the essential elements without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's criticism of leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred" by citing a Fox & Friends segment that claimed Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement, made after recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that killed 31 people, called for accountability on gun laws and rejecting racist sentiments, indirectly targeting Trump. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun control and instead blaming video games and mental illness. The El Paso shooter posted racist, anti-immigrant content echoing Trump's rhetoric. Obama linked the shootings to ideologies promoting white supremacy and urged rejecting leaders who demonize others, including immigrants. Trump has been accused of emboldening white nationalists through racist statements, such as his "send her back" rally targeting congresswomen of color. END OF SUMMARY.
