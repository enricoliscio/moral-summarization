SUMMARY: Donald Trump has come under fire for his response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, which left 31 people dead. Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment that defended him by claiming that Obama had also faced mass shootings during his presidency. However, Trump has been criticized for failing to acknowledge the role of guns in the attacks and for emboldening white nationalists with his racist statements. The El Paso shooter, in particular, echoed language used by Trump in a racist and anti-immigrant screed posted before the attack. Despite facing widespread condemnation, Trump continues to stoke racial tensions and has been accused of creating the very hatred that enabled the tragic events. Obama, in a statement that implicitly referred to Trump, urged Americans to reject leaders who normalize racism and incite fear. He called on the public to hold officials accountable for changing gun laws to prevent future tragedies. Trump's response, in contrast, has been to blame video games, the internet, and mental illness, while ignoring the role of guns and his own role in fostering a climate of hatred and division. Beto O'Rourke, a 2020 presidential candidate, opposed Trump's planned visit to El Paso, stating that the President has no place in a community that needs to heal from his hateful rhetoric.
END OF SUMMARY.
