SUMMARY: 
Former president Barack Obama issued an indirect criticism of Donald Trump in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. Obama urged Americans to "reject language that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalises racist sentiments". Trump, who has been accused of emboldening white nationalists and failing to condemn guns after the slaughter that left 31 dead, hit back by citing a Fox & Friends segment that claimed Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. The El Paso shooter's racist, anti-immigrant screed echoed Trump's rhetoric, and many have blamed Trump for stoking racial resentments and creating an environment conducive to such tragedies. Beto O'Rourke, a 2020 presidential candidate, opposed Trump's visit to El Paso, stating that the President "helped create the hatred that made Saturday's tragedy possible". Obama's statement called for the condemnation of "leaders who demonise those who don't look like us" and warned against language that refers to others as "subhuman". He also advised Americans to denounce leaders who suggest that immigrants "invade our way of life". Trump, meanwhile, has tempered his criticism of white supremacy and directed the FBI to address domestic terrorism. The moral framing of this issue highlights the need to address the root causes of such tragedies and to heal the divisions in American society. END OF SUMMARY.
