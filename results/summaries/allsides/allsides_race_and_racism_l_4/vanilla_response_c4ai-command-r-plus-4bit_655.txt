SUMMARY: In the wake of mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead, former President Barack Obama issued a statement calling on Americans to reject leaders who promote fear, hatred, and racist sentiments. Obama did not mention President Trump directly but emphasized the need to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. In response, Trump cited a Fox & Friends segment that compared the number of mass shootings during Obama's presidency to his own. Trump has faced criticism for blaming video games and mental illness instead of guns for the shootings and for his own racist rhetoric, which echoes the language used by the El Paso shooter. Beto O'Rourke and other Democrats opposed Trump's planned visit to El Paso and Dayton, arguing that his divisive rhetoric contributed to the tragedy. Obama's statement condemned the normalization of racism and white supremacy, indirectly referring to Trump's past statements on immigrants and people of color. Trump, meanwhile, has attempted to shift the blame away from himself and guns while calling for the FBI to address domestic terrorism.
END OF SUMMARY.
