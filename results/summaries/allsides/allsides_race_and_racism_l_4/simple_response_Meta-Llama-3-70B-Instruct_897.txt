SUMMARY:

Former President Barack Obama condemned the language of leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred or normalise racist sentiments", in a veiled criticism of President Trump's rhetoric. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which claimed that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency without being criticized. However, Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun laws and for emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. The El Paso shooting suspect posted a racist screed featuring language used by Trump, and Trump's visit to El Paso was opposed by Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, who argued that Trump's presence would only bring more division. Obama's statement emphasized the need to reject language that demonizes certain groups and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws to prevent such tragedies.

END OF SUMMARY.
