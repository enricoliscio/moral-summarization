Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should not only be concise but also reflect the ethical implications discussed in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump responding to Obama's comments on mass shootings and the role of leadership in addressing gun violence and racism. The article highlights the moral issues, such as Trump's focus on video games and mental illness instead of gun laws, and his controversial statements that some argue embolden white nationalists.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key events: Obama's call to action, Trump's response using Fox & Friends, the criticism Trump faces, and the context of the shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Also, it's important to include the moral critique, like how Trump's rhetoric is seen as divisive and contributing to hatred.

I should structure the summary to first mention Obama's statement, then Trump's response, followed by the criticism Trump received. I'll keep it under 200 words and make sure to highlight the moral aspects, such as the impact of leadership on societal issues and the role of rhetoric in promoting unity or division.

Let me draft this, ensuring each point is clear and the moral framing is evident. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and make sure the summary flows logically from one point to the next.

SUMMARY: Former President Barack Obama called on Americans to reject leaders who "feed a climate of fear and hatred or normalize racist sentiments" in response to recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. While not mentioning Donald Trump directly, Obama emphasized the need for accountability in addressing gun violence. Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment suggesting Obama's presidency saw 32 mass shootings, a claim criticized for downplaying the issue. Trump has faced criticism for linking mass shootings to video games and mental illness, rather than gun laws, and for emboldening white nationalists through his rhetoric. The El Paso shooter allegedly posted racist, anti-immigrant content resembling Trump's language. Trump plans to visit the shooting sites, but some, like Democratic candidate Beto Oâ€™Rourke, argue he should not, as his words have fueled division. Obama warned against leaders demonizing others and promoting ideologies tied to white supremacy, linking such language to historical tragedies. Trump has recently stoked racial tensions, including tweets targeting congresswomen of color. The article highlights the moral responsibility of leaders to promote unity and address systemic issues rather than scapegoating or ignoring gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
