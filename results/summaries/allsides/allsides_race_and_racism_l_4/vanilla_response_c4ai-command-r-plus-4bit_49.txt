SUMMARY: Donald Trump responded to Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings by citing a segment from Fox & Friends, which stated that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement, released after the recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, called for Americans to reject leaders who promote fear, hatred, and racist sentiments. Obama did not mention Trump directly but emphasized the need for accountability in changing gun laws. Trump, on the other hand, has faced criticism for blaming video games and mental illness for the shootings instead of addressing gun control. The El Paso shooter's manifesto echoed Trump's racist rhetoric, targeting immigrants and Hispanics. Trump's visit to El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, is opposed by Democrats like Beto O'Rourke, who believe Trump's divisive rhetoric contributed to the tragedy. Obama's statement highlighted the need to reject racism and white supremacy, while Trump's response focused on defending himself against accusations of promoting hate and division.
END OF SUMMARY.
