SUMMARY:
Former President Barack Obama urged Americans to "soundly reject language" that promotes a "climate of fear and hatred" and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws to prevent mass shootings. His statement came after two mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left 31 people dead. President Donald Trump responded by citing a Fox & Friends segment, which claimed that Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun laws and for emboldening white nationalists through his racist statements. Obama's statement was seen as a rebuke of Trump's language, which has been accused of promoting racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. Trump is set to visit El Paso and Dayton, but some Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, oppose the visit, saying Trump has "no place" in the cities he helped to divide. END OF SUMMARY.
