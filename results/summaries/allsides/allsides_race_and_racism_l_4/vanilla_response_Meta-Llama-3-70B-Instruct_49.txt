SUMMARY:

Donald Trump responded to former President Barack Obama's statement on mass shootings, citing a Fox & Friends segment that mentioned Obama had 32 mass shootings during his presidency. Obama's statement urged Americans to reject language that feeds fear and hatred, and to hold public officials accountable for changing gun laws. Trump has faced criticism for not addressing gun control and for emboldening white nationalists with his racist statements. The El Paso shooting suspect posted a racist screed featuring language used by Trump before the attack. Trump is expected to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, but some Democrats, including Beto O'Rourke, oppose the visit, saying Trump's presence would be divisive. Obama's comments were seen as a rebuke of Trump's rhetoric, which has been criticized for normalizing racism and white supremacy.
