Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article talks about Trump responding to Obama's statement regarding mass shootings. Obama criticized the normalization of racist sentiments without directly mentioning Trump, but Trump took it as a personal attack. He cited Fox & Friends, comparing Obama's presidency to Bush's response to Sandy Hook. Trump's critics are pointing out that he's not addressing gun control and instead blaming video games and mental illness. There's also mention of Trump's controversial statements emboldening white nationalists, and the suspect in El Paso using Trump's language. Obama's cautious approach but clear reference to Trump's rhetoric on immigration and racism. Trump's recent actions, like the tweets about congresswomen and the Baltimore comments, show he's been stoking racial tensions. Beto O’Rourke opposes Trump's visit to El Paso, emphasizing the need for healing, not division.

I need to capture the moral aspects: Trump's criticism of Obama, the gun control issue, the impact of Trump's rhetoric on violence, and the political divide. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and maintain the author's perspective that Trump's actions contribute to a harmful environment.

Let me structure the summary: Start with Trump's response to Obama, mention the Fox & Friends reference, then touch on the criticism about gun control and the El Paso suspect's connection. Highlight Obama's indirect criticism and Trump's recent actions. End with O’Rourke's opposition to Trump's visit, emphasizing healing over division.

I need to make sure each point flows logically and the moral framing is clear. Avoid any markdown, just plain text within the specified tokens.

The El Paso shooter's racist manifesto, echoing Trump's rhetoric, has further fueled accusations that Trump's language emboldens white nationalists.
