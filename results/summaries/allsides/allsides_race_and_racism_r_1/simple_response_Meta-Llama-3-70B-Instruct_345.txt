SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon's remarks were made during an episode where he spoke with Professor Griff, who has a history of making anti-Semitic comments. Cannon apologized for his words, stating that they were "wrong" and "lacked understanding and context". Fox has accepted his apology and will continue to work with him, believing that this moment calls for dialogue and education. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his bigotry and stating that he failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. The incident highlights the importance of acknowledging and apologizing for harmful words and actions, and the need for education and dialogue to combat bigotry.

END OF SUMMARY.
