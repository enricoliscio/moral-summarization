SUMMARY: Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon's comments, which lacked understanding and context, promoted hate and reinforced harmful stereotypes. He initially refused to apologize, instead demanding an apology from ViacomCBS and seeking full ownership of the comedy show "Wild 'N Out". However, after backlash, Cannon issued a sincere apology, acknowledging that his words were wrong and expressing remorse. Fox has accepted his apology, condemning all forms of hate and bigotry, and will work with Cannon to advance the conversation and promote healing and discussion. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon has since taken steps to educate himself and make amends, and has announced that he will be taking time away from his morning radio show to commit to deeper reflection and education. END OF SUMMARY.
