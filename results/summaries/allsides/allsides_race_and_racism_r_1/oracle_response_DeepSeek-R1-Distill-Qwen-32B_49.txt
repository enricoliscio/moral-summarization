Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Nick Cannon making anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, which Fox is allowing him to stay on "The Masked Singer." Fox's statement says they're moving forward with him to advance dialogue. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated their relationship with Cannon because they were troubled by his lack of acknowledgment and apology.

Cannon initially refused to apologize but later did, saying he's committed to learning and healing. He took a break from his radio show to reflect. He's been supported by some prominent figures.

I need to include the morally framed words like "comments," "pushed," "claimed," "said," "words," "lacked," "promoted," "apologized," "educate," "amends," "condemns," "hate," "directed," "combat," "bigotry," "failed," "perpetuating," "antisemitism," "refusing," "demanded," "ordered," "refused," "forcing," "making," "rhetoric," "healing," "discussion," "apologies," "reinforced," "help," "chastising."

I should structure the summary to cover Fox's decision, Cannon's comments, the apologies, the support, and the contrasting reactions from Fox and ViacomCBS. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure to include as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me start by mentioning Fox allowing Cannon despite his comments. Then, detail his anti-Semitic claims, the apology, Fox's stance on dialogue, ViacomCBS's termination, and Cannon's recent actions and support.

I should ensure that each sentence uses the appropriate moral terms. For example, when talking about his comments, use "pushed" and "claimed." When discussing the apology, use "apologized," "educate," "amends." For Fox's part, "condemns," "hate," "combat," "bigotry." ViacomCBS's reaction uses "failed," "perpetuating," "antisemitism," "refusing," "demanded," "ordered." His refusal to apologize initially, then his later actions and support.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements concisely.

SUMMARY: Fox has allowed Nick Cannon to remain on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic comments made during a podcast interview with Professor Griff. Cannon claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and said Jewish people and white people are "the true savages." Fox stated that Cannon apologized, acknowledging his words were wrong and lacked understanding, and expressed remorse. The network plans to help him advance dialogue on the issue, while ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condeming his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, demanding an apology from ViacomCBS and full ownership of his show. He later issued a statement apologizing and committing to education and healing. Cannon also took a break from his radio show to reflect. Despite his apologies, some criticized his initial response as insufficient. Prominent figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs have supported Cannon. END OF SUMMARY.
