Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Nick Cannon and Fox's response. Let me read through the article carefully.

So, the article says Fox is letting Nick Cannon stay on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic comments. He made these comments during a podcast episode with Professor Griff, who's known for anti-Semitic remarks. They talked about some anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people can't be anti-Semitic because Semitic people are black. Cannon also called white people and Jewish people "true savages." 

Fox's statement says Cannon apologized and is remorseful. They believe in dialogue and helping him address the issue. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, ended their relationship with him because they were troubled by his failure to acknowledge or apologize for promoting anti-Semitism.

Cannon initially refused to apologize, demanded an apology from ViacomCBS, and wanted full ownership of his show. His first apology on Facebook was seen as insufficient, and he later said apologies are empty. However, in a more recent statement, he apologized sincerely, acknowledged the hurt caused, and committed to learning and building connections with the Jewish community. He also took a break from his radio show to reflect and educate himself. He has support from figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Fox keeping Cannon on the show, his comments, Fox's stance, ViacomCBS terminating their contract, Cannon's initial refusal and later apology, and his commitment to education.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with Fox's decision, mention the podcast and comments, then Fox's response, ViacomCBS's action, Cannon's initial refusal and later apology, and his commitment to learning.

I need to ensure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit. Also, make sure to include that his first apology was seen as insufficient and that he's taking time off to reflect.

I think that's a solid summary. Let me put it together.
