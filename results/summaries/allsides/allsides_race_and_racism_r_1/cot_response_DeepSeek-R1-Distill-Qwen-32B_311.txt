Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral implications involved.

The article talks about Nick Cannon making anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast. Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer" despite this, while ViacomCBS terminated their relationship with him. Cannon initially refused to apologize but later did so, and Fox is supporting him to continue the conversation.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that carry a moral framing. I'll go through the article again and pick out words that have a strong moral connotation. Words like "anti-Semitic," "condemns," "hate," "apologized," "remorseful," "wrong," "condemns," "bigotry," "uninformed," "ashamed," "eye-opening," "gratitude," "enlighten," "committed," "reflection," and "education" stand out as morally charged.

Next, I need to write a concise summary that includes as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral actions taken by each party involved. I'll make sure to highlight Fox's support for Cannon despite his comments, ViacomCBS's decision to terminate their relationship, and Cannon's eventual apology and commitment to learning.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: Cannon's comments, Fox's response, ViacomCBS's response, Cannon's apology, and his subsequent actions. I'll ensure that the moral framing words are included to reflect the author's perspective on the situation.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate all the important details and the moral language. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that the summary flows logically, preserving the original moral framing.
