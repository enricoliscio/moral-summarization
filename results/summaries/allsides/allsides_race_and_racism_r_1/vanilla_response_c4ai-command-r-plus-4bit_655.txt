SUMMARY: Nick Cannon made anti-Semitic and anti-white comments during a June 30 episode of his "Cannon's Class" podcast, sparking widespread backlash. Fox, which airs "The Masked Singer," has decided to keep Cannon on the show despite the controversy. The network acknowledged that Cannon's comments were wrong and promoted hate, but they believe this moment calls for dialogue and plan to work with Cannon to advance the conversation. ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize but eventually issued a statement expressing remorse for his hurtful words and pledging to educate himself. He also announced he would be taking time away from his morning radio show to focus on reflection and education. The situation has sparked debates about the appropriate response to public figures' controversial statements.
END OF SUMMARY.
