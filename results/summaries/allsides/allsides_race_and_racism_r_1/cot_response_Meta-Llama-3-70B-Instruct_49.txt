SUMMARY:
Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic. He also referred to "white people" and Jewish people as "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon finally expressed remorse and apologized for his "hurtful and divisive words" that "reinforced the worst stereotypes" of the Jewish community. Fox condemned all forms of hate and bigotry, but believed that Cannon's apology and commitment to education and healing were sufficient to move forward with him. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. END OF SUMMARY.
