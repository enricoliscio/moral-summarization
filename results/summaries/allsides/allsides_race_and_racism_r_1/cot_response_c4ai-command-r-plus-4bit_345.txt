SUMMARY: Nick Cannon made anti-Semitic and anti-white remarks during a June 30 episode of his podcast "Cannon's Class." Fox has decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer," stating that Cannon is "clear and remorseful" about his comments. Fox aims to "help him advance this important conversation, broadly." On the other hand, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his failure to "acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism." Cannon initially refused to apologize, demanding an apology from ViacomCBS instead. However, he eventually expressed his "deepest and most sincere apologies" to the Jewish community, acknowledging the hurtful nature of his words. Cannon also announced he would take time away from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. He has received support from notable figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.
END OF SUMMARY.
