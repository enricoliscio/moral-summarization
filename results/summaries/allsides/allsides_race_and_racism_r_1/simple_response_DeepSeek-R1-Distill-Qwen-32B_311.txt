Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. 

So, the article is about Nick Cannon making anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, which led to some consequences. Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer," while ViacomCBS terminated their relationship. Cannon initially didn't want to apologize but later did, and Fox supported him, saying they want to promote dialogue. 

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements. I should highlight Fox's decision, ViacomCBS's reaction, Cannon's initial refusal and then his apology, and the context of his comments. Also, the moral aspect is important—how Fox supports dialogue while others see it as promoting hate.

I should structure the summary to first mention Fox's decision, then ViacomCBS's termination, followed by Cannon's initial refusal and subsequent apology. Then, explain Fox's reasoning and the mixed reactions. Keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all necessary details.

I should also make sure the moral framing is clear—Fox believes in dialogue and education, while others see it as a failure to address hate. That's the key contrast to highlight.

Let me draft this, making sure each point is covered succinctly. I'll start with Fox's decision, then ViacomCBS's action, Cannon's initial stance, his apology, Fox's reasoning, and the broader implications. 

I need to ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go. 

Yes, that should cover all the important aspects while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the original article.

SUMMARY:  
Fox has allowed Nick Cannon to remain on *The Masked Singer* despite his controversial remarks on his podcast, where he made anti-Semitic comments and claimed black people cannot be anti-Semitic. Cannon later apologized, stating his words were wrong and lacked context, and Fox expressed support for him, emphasizing dialogue and education. ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, arguing that apologies are "empty," but later issued a more sincere statement, acknowledging his mistakes and committing to learning and building connections with Jewish communities. Fox defended its decision, stating it believes in promoting dialogue and combating hate, while critics argue the move could be seen as enabling harmful rhetoric. Cannon also announced he would take time away from his radio show to reflect and educate himself. END OF SUMMARY.
