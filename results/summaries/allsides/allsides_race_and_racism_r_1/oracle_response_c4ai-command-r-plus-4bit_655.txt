SUMMARY: Fox is standing by Nick Cannon following his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a June 30 episode of his podcast, "Cannon's Class." While ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, Fox has decided to "move forward" with the host, acknowledging his remorse and willingness to educate himself. Cannon initially refused to apologize for his comments, which included anti-Semitic theories and claims that black people cannot be anti-Semitic. He also demanded an apology from ViacomCBS and full ownership of the show "Wild 'N Out." However, in a recent statement, Cannon expressed his deepest apologies to the Jewish community, acknowledging the hurtful nature of his words and committing to deeper learning and strengthening the bond between cultures. He will be taking time away from his morning radio show to focus on reflection and education. Fox's decision to keep Cannon on "The Masked Singer" has sparked mixed reactions, with some supporting his efforts to educate himself and others criticizing the network for condoning his comments.
END OF SUMMARY.
