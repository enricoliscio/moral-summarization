Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Nick Cannon and his situation with Fox and ViacomCBS. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

Okay, the article starts by saying Fox is allowing Nick Cannon to stay on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic comments. These comments were made during a podcast episode where he discussed with Professor Griff, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks. They talked about anti-Semitic theories and made some incorrect statements about black people not being able to be anti-Semitic because Semitic people are black. Cannon also called white people and Jewish people "true savages."

Fox released a statement saying Cannon is remorseful and apologized. They decided to keep him on the show to help advance the conversation. On the other hand, ViacomCBS terminated their relationship with him, saying they were troubled by his failure to apologize properly.

Cannon initially refused to apologize but later did so, though some found his first apology insufficient. He then argued that apologies are empty and emphasized the need for dialogue and education instead. He also took time off from his radio show to reflect and learn more.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all these points. I should make sure to mention Fox's decision, ViacomCBS's reaction, Cannon's apologies, and his commitment to education. Also, include the conflicting responses from different parties and his backing by prominent figures.

I should structure it in a way that flows logically, starting with the incident, then Fox's stance, ViacomCBS's stance, Cannon's apologies and actions, and the support he's receiving. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is key.
