SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon's remarks, made while speaking with Professor Griff, promoted hate and lacked understanding and context. He claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and referred to white people and Jewish people as "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon finally expressed remorse and apologized for his words, acknowledging that they were wrong and hurtful. Fox condemned all forms of hate and bigotry, but chose to give Cannon a second chance, believing that he is committed to educating himself and making amends. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon has since taken steps to educate himself and has announced that he will be taking time away from his radio show to reflect and learn. END OF SUMMARY.
