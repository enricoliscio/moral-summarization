SUMMARY: Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a podcast episode with Professor Griff, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks. Fox acknowledged that Cannon's comments were wrong and promoted hate but emphasized dialogue and education as a path forward. They stated that they condemn all forms of hate and will combat bigotry. ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, expressing disappointment in his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize but eventually issued a statement expressing remorse and committing to learning and strengthening the bond between cultures. He also announced time away from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. Prominent figures have supported Cannon's educational approach. This incident highlights the complex moral issues surrounding free speech, accountability, and the need for ongoing dialogue and education to combat bigotry and promote understanding.
END OF SUMMARY.
