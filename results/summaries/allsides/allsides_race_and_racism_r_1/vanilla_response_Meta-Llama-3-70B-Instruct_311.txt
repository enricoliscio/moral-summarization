SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had made the comments during an episode featuring Professor Griff, who has a history of making anti-Semitic remarks. Fox stated that Cannon is "clear and remorseful that his words were wrong" and has apologized for his comments. The network plans to "move forward with Nick and help him advance this important conversation, broadly". This decision comes after ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing that he "failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism". Cannon had initially refused to apologize and instead demanded an apology from ViacomCBS. He later issued a statement apologizing for his comments and announced that he would be taking time away from his morning radio show to educate himself further.

END OF SUMMARY.
