Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points. 

First, the article is about Nick Cannon making anti-Semitic comments on his podcast. Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer" despite this, while ViacomCBS terminated their relationship. 

I should mention Cannon's comments, his initial refusal to apologize, and his later apology. Also, Fox's reasoning for keeping him, emphasizing dialogue and education, is important. ViacomCBS's stance against bigotry is another key point.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the conflicting responses from Fox and ViacomCBS, and touch on Cannon's attempts to address the issue. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is crucial. I'll make sure to include the moral aspects, like promoting dialogue versus condemnable actions.
