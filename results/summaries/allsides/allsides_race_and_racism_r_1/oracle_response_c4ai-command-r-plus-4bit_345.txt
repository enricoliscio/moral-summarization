SUMMARY: Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain on "The Masked Singer," despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a podcast episode with Professor Griff, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks. Cannon pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic because "Semitic people are black people." He also promoted the idea that "white people" and Jews are "savages." Fox acknowledged that Cannon's words lacked understanding and context and inadvertently promoted hate. However, they appreciated his remorse and apology, and will work with him to advance the conversation on combating hate and bigotry. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize but has since expressed remorse and committed to educating himself and making amends. He will take time away from his radio show to focus on reflection and education, receiving support from prominent figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.
END OF SUMMARY.
