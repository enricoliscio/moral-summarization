SUMMARY:
Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic. He also referred to "white people" and Jewish people as "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon eventually issued a heartfelt apology, expressing remorse for his wrong and hurtful words. Fox condemned all forms of hate and bigotry, but chose to give Cannon a second chance, believing that this moment calls for dialogue and education. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his bigotry and lack of apology. Cannon has since taken steps to educate himself and make amends, and has announced that he will take time away from his morning radio show for deeper reflection and education. END OF SUMMARY.
