Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nick Cannon and Fox's response to his comments. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says that Fox is letting Nick Cannon stay on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments. These comments were made during a podcast episode where he talked with Professor Griff, who has a history of making anti-Semitic remarks. They discussed some anti-Semitic theories, and Cannon claimed that black people can't be anti-Semitic because Semitic people are black. He also called white people and Jewish people "true savages."

Fox released a statement saying Cannon apologized and is remorseful. They believe in dialogue and will support him in advancing this conversation. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated their relationship with Cannon, saying they were troubled by his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism.

Cannon initially refused to apologize, demanded an apology from ViacomCBS, and wanted ownership of his show. His first apology was seen as insufficient, and he later refused to apologize again, saying apologies are empty. He emphasized the need for healing and discussion instead of just saying sorry.

Cannon's most recent apology was more detailed, acknowledging the hurt caused and committing to learning and building bridges with the Jewish community. He also took a break from his radio show to reflect and educate himself. He's been supported by figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.

So, the key points are:
- Cannon made anti-Semitic comments on a podcast.
- Fox kept him on the show, believing in dialogue and his remorse.
- ViacomCBS terminated their contract with him.
- Cannon's initial apology was insufficient, but he later apologized more thoroughly.
- He's taking time to educate himself and build connections with the Jewish community.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should make sure to include Fox's decision, ViacomCBS's reaction, Cannon's apologies, and his commitment to education. I'll structure it to flow logically, mentioning the incident, the responses from Fox and ViacomCBS, Cannon's apologies, and his current actions.
