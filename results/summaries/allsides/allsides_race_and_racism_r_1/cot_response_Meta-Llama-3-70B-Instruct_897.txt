SUMMARY:
Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that "white people" and Jewish people are "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon finally issued a sincere apology for his hurtful and divisive words, acknowledging that they were wrong and lacked understanding and context. Fox has accepted his apology and will move forward with him, believing that this moment calls for dialogue and education. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning bigotry of any kind. Cannon has taken steps to educate himself and make amends, and has announced that he will take time off from his radio show to commit to deeper reflection and education. END OF SUMMARY.
