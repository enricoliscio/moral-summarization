SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had made the comments during an interview with Professor Griff, who has a history of making anti-Semitic remarks. Fox stated that Cannon is "clear and remorseful that his words were wrong" and has apologized for his actions. The network believes that Cannon's mistake can be used as an opportunity for dialogue and education. In contrast, ViacomCBS has terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing that he failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, but later issued a statement expressing his deepest apologies to the Jewish community and committing to educate himself further. He has also announced that he will be taking time away from his morning radio show to reflect and educate himself. END OF SUMMARY.
