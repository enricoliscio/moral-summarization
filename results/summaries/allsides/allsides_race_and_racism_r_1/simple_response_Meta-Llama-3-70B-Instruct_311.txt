SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and referred to white people and Jewish people as "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon eventually issued a statement apologizing for his hurtful and divisive words. Fox has accepted his apology and will continue to work with him, stating that they condemn all forms of hate and will help Cannon "advance this important conversation". In contrast, ViacomCBS has terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his bigotry and refusal to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. The incident highlights the importance of acknowledging and apologizing for harmful words and actions, and the need for education and dialogue to combat hate and bigotry.
