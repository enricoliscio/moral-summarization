SUMMARY: 
Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon on "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made on his podcast "Cannon's Class." Cannon's remarks, which included anti-Semitic theories and claims that black people cannot be anti-Semitic, drew sharp criticism. While Fox acknowledged that Cannon's words were "wrong" and "lacked understanding and context," they also stated that he is "remorseful" and has apologized. Fox plans to work with Cannon to "advance [an] important conversation" about these issues. ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, demanding an apology from ViacomCBS and full ownership of his show "Wild 'N Out." He later issued a statement expressing his "deepest and most sincere apologies" to the Jewish community and acknowledged the hurtful and divisive nature of his words. Cannon also announced he would be taking time off from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. The situation has sparked debates about the appropriate response to such incidents, with some emphasizing the need for healing, dialogue, and education over empty apologies.
