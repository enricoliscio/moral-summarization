SUMMARY:
Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had made hateful remarks, claiming that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and that "white people" and Jewish people are "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon finally expressed remorse and apologized for his wrong and hurtful words. Fox has accepted his apology and will continue to work with him, believing that this moment calls for dialogue and education. In contrast, ViacomCBS has terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his bigotry and refusal to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. END OF SUMMARY.
