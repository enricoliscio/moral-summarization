SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon's remarks, which promoted hate and lacked understanding and context, were widely condemned. He initially refused to apologize, instead demanding an apology from ViacomCBS and seeking full ownership of the comedy show "Wild 'N Out". However, after facing backlash, Cannon issued a sincere apology, acknowledging that his words were wrong and hurtful. Fox accepted his apology, stating that they "will move forward with Nick and help him advance this important conversation, broadly". In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning bigotry of any kind. Cannon has since taken steps to educate himself and make amends, and has announced that he will take time away from his morning radio show to commit to deeper reflection and education. Fox has emphasized its commitment to combating bigotry and promoting healing and discussion.

END OF SUMMARY.
