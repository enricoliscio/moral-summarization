Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main issue is Nick Cannon's anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, leading to Fox supporting him while ViacomCBS terminated their contract. 

I should identify the morally charged words used by the author. Words like "anti-Semitic," "condemns," "apologized," "combat bigotry," etc., are important. My summary needs to include these terms to maintain the original moral tone.

Next, I'll outline the main events: Cannon's comments, Fox's support, ViacomCBS's termination, Cannon's initial refusal to apologize, and his subsequent steps to educate himself. I need to ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the differing responses from Fox and ViacomCBS.

I also need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include Cannon's apology and his commitment to learning, as well as the support from other figures. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

Finally, I'll structure the summary starting with Cannon's actions, then Fox's response, followed by ViacomCBS's decision, Cannon's apologies and steps taken, and conclude with the support he's receiving. This should cover all necessary points while preserving the moral elements.

SUMMARY: Nick Cannon made anti-Semitic comments during a podcast interview with Richard Griffin, a figure known for such rhetoric. Cannon claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and criticized Jewish and white people, sparking widespread condemnation. Fox, however, chose to support Cannon, stating he was remorseful and committed to education and dialogue. The network emphasized its opposition to hate and bigotry. ViacomCBS, in contrast, terminated its relationship with Cannon, criticizing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, arguing that apologies were empty, but later issued a sincere apology, acknowledging the hurt caused and committing to learning and healing. He also took time away from his radio show to reflect and educate himself. Despite the backlash, Cannon has been supported by figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs. END OF SUMMARY.
