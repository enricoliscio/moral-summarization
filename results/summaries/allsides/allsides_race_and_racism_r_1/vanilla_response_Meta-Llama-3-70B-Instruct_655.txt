SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had made the comments during an episode where he spoke with Professor Griff, who has a history of making anti-Semitic remarks. Fox stated that Cannon is "clear and remorseful that his words were wrong" and has apologized for his actions. The network believes that Cannon's apology and willingness to educate himself and make amends are sufficient to move forward with him. In contrast, ViacomCBS has terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon has received backing from prominent figures such as Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.

END OF SUMMARY.
