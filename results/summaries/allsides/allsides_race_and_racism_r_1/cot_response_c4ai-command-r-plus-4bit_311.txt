SUMMARY: Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain on "The Masked Singer" despite the anti-Semitic and anti-white comments he made on his podcast, "Cannon's Class." During the episode, Cannon and his guest, Professor Griff, promoted anti-Semitic theories and made false claims about the inability of black people to be anti-Semitic. Fox acknowledged that Cannon's words were wrong and lacked understanding and context, inadvertently promoting hate. However, they accepted his apology and expressed their belief that this moment calls for dialogue and education rather than punishment. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated their relationship with Cannon, stating that they condemn all forms of bigotry and are deeply troubled by his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize and demanded an apology from ViacomCBS instead. He eventually issued a statement expressing his remorse and committing to educating himself and making amends. Fox and prominent figures in the industry have supported his efforts toward healing, correction, and strengthening the bond between cultures through deeper reflection and discussion. END OF SUMMARY.
