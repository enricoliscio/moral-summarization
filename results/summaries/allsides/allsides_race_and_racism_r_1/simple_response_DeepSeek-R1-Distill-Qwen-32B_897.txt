Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Nick Cannon and Fox's decision to keep him on "The Masked Singer." The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the article. First, I should identify the key points: Cannon made anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, Fox decided to keep him on the show despite the backlash, while ViacomCBS terminated their relationship with him. 

I should note Cannon's initial refusal to apologize and his later statement. It's important to highlight Fox's reasoning, which includes his remorse and their desire to promote dialogue. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, took a different stance, emphasizing their condemnation of bigotry. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the differing responses from Fox and ViacomCBS. Also, mention Cannon's subsequent actions, like taking time off for reflection. I should make sure the moral aspects are clearâ€”Fox's support for dialogue versus ViacomCBS's condemnation of hate speech. 

Let me structure it: start with the controversy, Fox's decision, Cannon's apology, ViacomCBS's response, and the differing approaches to handling the situation. I need to ensure the summary is concise and captures the moral framing without bias.
