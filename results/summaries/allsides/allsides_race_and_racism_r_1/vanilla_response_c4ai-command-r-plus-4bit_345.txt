SUMMARY: Nick Cannon made anti-Semitic and anti-white comments during a June 30 episode of his "Cannon's Class" podcast, sparking widespread backlash. Fox, the network that airs "The Masked Singer," has decided to keep Cannon on the show despite his comments. They acknowledged that Cannon's words were wrong and promoted hate, but they appreciated his remorse and willingness to educate himself. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated their relationship with Cannon, stating that he failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize but eventually issued a statement expressing remorse for his hurtful words and pledging to educate himself further on the Jewish experience. He also announced he would be taking time away from his morning radio show to focus on reflection and education. Prominent figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs have supported Cannon.
END OF SUMMARY.
