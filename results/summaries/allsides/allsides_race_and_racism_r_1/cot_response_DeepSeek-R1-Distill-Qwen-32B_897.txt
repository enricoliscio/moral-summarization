Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Nick Cannon and Fox's response to his comments. First, I should understand the task.

The user wants me to do two things: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a summary preserving those words. I need to make sure I capture the moral aspects correctly.

Looking at the article, I see words like "anti-Semitic," "condemns," "apologized," "remorseful," "hate," "bigotry," etc. These are the morally charged words. I should list them all in step one.

Next, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those moral terms as possible. I should structure it to highlight Fox's decision, Cannon's comments, the apologies, and the differing responses from Fox and ViacomCBS.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and accurately represents the article's content while emphasizing the moral implications. I'll start by mentioning Fox allowing Cannon on the show despite his comments, then detail the comments and apologies, and contrast Fox's approach with ViacomCBS's termination.

I should also include Cannon's refusal to apologize initially and his later steps to educate himself. Ending with the support he's received ties it all together.

I need to be careful not to add any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral framing. Let me make sure each point is clear and the summary is within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
Nick Cannon remains on *The Masked Singer* after Fox decided to continue working with him despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a podcast interview. Cannon apologized, expressing remorse and acknowledging his words were wrong and promoted hate. Fox stated they would help Cannon advance the conversation on these issues, while ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with him, condemning his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, claiming apologies are empty, but later issued a sincere apology, vowing to educate himself and strengthen bonds with the Jewish community. He also took time away from his radio show to reflect and learn. Cannon has received support from prominent figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs.
