SUMMARY: Fox is allowing Nick Cannon to remain on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments. Cannon made the comments during a June 30 episode of his "Cannon's Class" podcast, where he pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic. Fox has confirmed that Cannon is remorseful for his words and will work with him to "advance this important conversation." ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated its relationship with Cannon, stating that it "condemns bigotry of any kind" and is troubled by Cannon's failure to apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, demanding an apology from ViacomCBS instead. However, he has since issued a statement apologizing for his hurtful and divisive words and committing himself to learning and strengthening the bond between the two cultures. He has also announced that he will be taking time away from his morning radio show to focus on reflection and education.
END OF SUMMARY.
