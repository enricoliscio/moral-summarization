SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had made inflammatory statements, including claiming that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and that white people and Jewish people are "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon eventually issued a statement expressing remorse and a commitment to education and healing. Fox has accepted his apology and will continue to work with him, citing a desire to "advance this important conversation" and combat bigotry. In contrast, ViacomCBS has terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his perpetuation of anti-Semitism. The decision has sparked controversy, with some praising Fox's willingness to facilitate dialogue and others criticizing the network for not taking a stronger stance against hate speech.

END OF SUMMARY.
