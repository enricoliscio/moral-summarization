Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Nick Cannon making anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, which led to some networks taking action. Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer," while ViacomCBS terminated their relationship. 

I notice the author used words like "comments," "pushed," "claimed," "said," "words," "lacked," "promoted," "apologized," "educate," "amends," "condemns," "hate," "directed," "combat," "bigotry," "failed," "perpetuating," "antisemitism," "refusing," "demanded," "ordered," "refused," "forcing," "making," "rhetoric," "healing," "discussion," "apologies," "reinforced," "help," "chastising."

I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and highlight Fox's support despite the controversy, Cannon's apology, and the differing responses from Fox and ViacomCBS.

I'll start by mentioning Fox's decision, then Cannon's comments and their impact. Then, I'll note Fox's reasoning and Cannon's steps to educate himself. I'll contrast that with ViacomCBS's decision to terminate their relationship. Finally, I'll include Cannon's refusal to apologize initially and his subsequent actions to learn and reflect.

Let me make sure to include the morally charged words and keep the summary within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Fox has decided to retain Nick Cannon on *The Masked Singer* despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a podcast interview with Professor Griff, a figure known for anti-Semitic remarks. Cannon's comments included claims that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and that white and Jewish people are "the true savages." Fox acknowledged that Cannon's words were wrong and lacked understanding, and he has since apologized, expressing remorse and a commitment to education and amends. The network stated it supports dialogue and combating bigotry, while ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his failure to address anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, insisting on healing through discussion rather than empty apologies. He later issued a more detailed apology, acknowledging the harm caused and vowing to learn from Jewish leaders. Cannon also took a break from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. His actions have been backed by prominent figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs. END OF SUMMARY.
