SUMMARY:
Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that "white people" and Jewish people are "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon finally expressed remorse and apologized for his "hurtful and divisive words". Fox condemned all forms of hate and bigotry, but believed that Cannon's apology and commitment to education and healing were sufficient to move forward. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon has since taken steps to educate himself and make amends, and has been backed by prominent figures. END OF SUMMARY.
