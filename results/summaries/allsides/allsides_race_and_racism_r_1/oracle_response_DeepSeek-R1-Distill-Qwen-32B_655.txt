Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Nick Cannon made anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer," while ViacomCBS terminated their contract with him. Cannon initially refused to apologize but later did, and Fox is supporting him to promote dialogue.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally framed words. Let me list them again: comments, pushed, claimed, said, words, lacked, promoted, apologized, educate, amends, condemns, hate, directed, combat, bigotry, failed, perpetuating, antisemitism, refusing, demanded, ordered, refused, forcing, making, rhetoric, healing, discussion, apologies, reinforced, help, chastising.

I should structure the summary to cover Cannon's comments, Fox's support, ViacomCBS's decision, Cannon's apology, and the reactions. I'll use the words like "anti-Semitic comments," "pushed," "claimed," "condemns," "apologized," "educate," etc.

I'll start by stating that Fox is allowing Cannon to stay on the show despite his comments. Then mention ViacomCBS terminated him. Highlight that Cannon apologized after initial refusal. Include Fox's support for dialogue and education. Also, note that some found his apology insufficient.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll make sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay under 200.

Let me draft it:

Nick Cannon's anti-Semitic comments on his podcast led to Fox allowing him to stay on "The Masked Singer," while ViacomCBS terminated their contract. Cannon initially refused to apologize but later apologized, claiming he's committed to education and healing. Fox supports him to promote dialogue, while others criticized his initial insufficient apology.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details, like the content of his comments, Fox's statement, and the broader context.

Let me try again, ensuring I include the key points and as many moral words as possible.

Nick Cannon's anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, where he pushed stereotypes and claimed black people can't be anti-Semitic, led to Fox supporting him despite his words promoting hate. Cannon apologized, vowing to educate himself and make amends, while ViacomCBS terminated him for failing to address the bigotry. Fox condemns hate and supports dialogue, while some criticized Cannon's initial refusal to apologize and his rhetoric.

Hmm, that's better. It includes "comments," "pushed," "claimed," "words," "promoted," "apologized," "educate," "amends," "condemns," "hate," "failed," "bigotry," "refused," "rhetoric."

I think this covers the main points and uses the moral words effectively. I'll make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally.
