SUMMARY: Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a June 30 episode of his podcast, "Cannon's Class." Cannon and his guest, Professor Griff, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks, promoted anti-Semitic theories and made false claims about the inability of black people to be anti-Semitic. Cannon also targeted "white people" and Jewish people with harmful rhetoric. While Fox acknowledged that Cannon's words were wrong and promoted hate, they expressed their intention to "move forward" with him and help advance a dialogue on this important issue. Fox stated that they "condemn all forms of hate" and will combat bigotry. Conversely, ViacomCBS ended their relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge and apologize for his anti-Semitic statements. Cannon initially refused to apologize, demanding an apology from ViacomCBS instead. He eventually expressed remorse and a commitment to educating himself, assuring the Jewish community that he has no hatred or malicious intent in his heart. Cannon also announced a break from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. He has received support from notable figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.
END OF SUMMARY.
