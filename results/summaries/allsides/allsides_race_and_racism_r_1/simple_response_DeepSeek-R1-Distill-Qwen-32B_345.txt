Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Nick Cannon's comments and the reactions from Fox and ViacomCBS.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. Nick made anti-Semitic comments on his podcast, and Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer." ViacomCBS terminated their contract with him. He apologized but initially refused, then later did so, and took time off to reflect.

I need to highlight the moral aspects: Fox supporting Cannon despite his remarks, while ViacomCBS took a stricter stance. Also, Cannon's refusal to apologize initially and his subsequent steps to educate himself.

I should structure the summary to include these elements, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start by stating Fox's decision, then mention ViacomCBS's response. Next, I'll cover Cannon's initial refusal and his later apology, including his commitment to education. Finally, I'll note his support from other figures.

I need to ensure the summary is concise and captures the moral framing, showing the contrast between Fox and ViacomCBS's approaches, and Cannon's journey from denial to taking responsibility.

SUMMARY: Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon on *The Masked Singer* despite his controversial anti-Semitic comments made during a podcast interview with Professor Griff, a known figure for anti-Semitic remarks. Cannon claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and accused white people and Jewish individuals of being "true savages." While Cannon later apologized and expressed remorse, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with him, stating they were "deeply troubled" by his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, arguing that apologies are "empty," but later issued a more detailed apology, acknowledging the harm caused and committing to learning and growth. He also took a hiatus from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. Fox, however, chose to support Cannon, stating they believe in using this moment for dialogue and healing. Cannon has been backed by prominent figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs. END OF SUMMARY.
