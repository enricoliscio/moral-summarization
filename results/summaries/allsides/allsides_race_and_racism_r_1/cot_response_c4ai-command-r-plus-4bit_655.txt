SUMMARY:
Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon on "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made on his podcast. Cannon's comments, which included pushing anti-Semitic theories and claiming that black people cannot be anti-Semitic, drew strong criticism and prompted an apology from Cannon. Fox acknowledged Cannon's remorse and his willingness to educate himself and make amends. The network stated that it "condemns all forms of hate" and will work with Cannon to advance the conversation on combating bigotry. ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize and demanded an apology from ViacomCBS instead. He eventually expressed remorse and committed to learning from his mistakes, assuring the Jewish community that he is dedicated to deepening the bond between their cultures. Prominent figures have supported Cannon's decision to take time away from his radio show to focus on reflection and education.
END OF SUMMARY.
