SUMMARY: Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a June 30 episode of his "Cannon's Class" podcast. In the episode, Cannon and his guest, Professor Griff, pushed anti-Semitic theories and made false claims about black people being unable to be anti-Semitic. Fox released a statement saying that Cannon has shown remorse for his words and has taken steps to educate himself. The network plans to work with Cannon to advance the conversation around this issue and combat bigotry. ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, stating that he failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize but eventually issued a statement expressing his regret and committing to educating himself further on the Jewish experience. He also announced that he would be taking time away from his morning radio show to focus on reflection and education. Prominent figures such as Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs have supported Cannon.
END OF SUMMARY.
