SUMMARY: Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made on his podcast, "Cannon's Class." Cannon's comments, which included anti-Semitic theories and claims that black people cannot be anti-Semitic, sparked backlash and led to his termination from ViacomCBS. While Fox condemned Cannon's statements, they acknowledged his remorse and apology, and stated that they will work with him to advance the conversation on combating bigotry. Cannon has since issued multiple apologies and announced that he will be taking time away from his radio show to focus on education and reflection. He has received support from several prominent figures, including Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.
END OF SUMMARY.
