SUMMARY: Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic, and also said that "white people" and Jewish people are "the true savages". He initially refused to apologize, saying that "apologies are empty", but later issued a statement expressing remorse and a commitment to education and making amends. Fox condemned all forms of hate and bigotry, but chose to move forward with Cannon, believing that this moment calls for dialogue and education. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon's apology was met with support from some prominent figures, but also criticism for his initial refusal to apologize and his subsequent statements. END OF SUMMARY.
