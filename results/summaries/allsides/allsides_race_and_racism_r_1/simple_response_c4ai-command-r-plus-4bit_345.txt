SUMMARY: Fox is allowing Nick Cannon to continue hosting "The Masked Singer" despite making anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast, "Cannon's Class." During the episode, Cannon and his guest, Professor Griff, promoted anti-Semitic theories and made false claims about black people being unable to be anti-Semitic. Fox acknowledged that Cannon's words were wrong and lacked understanding but decided to keep him on the show, stating that they will help him "advance this important conversation." ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize and demanded an apology from ViacomCBS, but eventually expressed remorse and committed to educating himself. He also announced a break from his morning radio show to focus on reflection and education. Prominent figures have supported him throughout this process.
END OF SUMMARY.
