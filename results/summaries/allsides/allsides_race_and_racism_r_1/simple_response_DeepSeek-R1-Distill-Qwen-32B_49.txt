Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Nick Cannon and Fox's response to his comments. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points and the ethical implications.

First, the article talks about Nick Cannon making anti-Semitic comments on his podcast. He claimed that black people can't be anti-Semitic and criticized white people and Jewish people. Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer" despite this, saying he's remorseful and wants to have a dialogue. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated their relationship with him because they felt his apology wasn't sufficient.

I should highlight Fox's decision to keep him, their reasoning, and the contrast with ViacomCBS's reaction. Also, mention Cannon's initial refusal to apologize and his later statement where he apologized but emphasized the need for dialogue over just saying "I'm sorry." 

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise. Let me structure it by first stating the main event, then Fox's response, ViacomCBS's response, Cannon's apology, and the implications of both companies' decisions. 

I should ensure that the moral aspects are clear, like Fox's support for dialogue and education versus ViacomCBS's stance against bigotry. Also, note that some found his apology insufficient and the ongoing debate about accountability versus growth.

Alright, putting it all together in a clear, concise manner while keeping the moral framing intact.

SUMMARY: Nick Cannon has remained on *The Masked Singer* after Fox decided to support him despite his anti-Semitic comments on a podcast. Cannon claimed that black people couldnâ€™t be anti-Semitic and criticized white and Jewish people as "true savages." Fox stated that Cannon apologized, acknowledging his words were wrong and lacking context, and they plan to help him advance a broader dialogue on the issue. ViacomCBS, however, terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to adequately address the anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, arguing that apologies are "empty" and advocating for dialogue and education instead. He later issued a more detailed apology, expressing regret and committing to learning and building connections with Jewish communities. His decision to step away from his radio show to reflect and educate himself has been supported by figures like Sean Combs. The situation highlights tensions between accountability for harmful speech and opportunities for growth and dialogue. END OF SUMMARY.
