SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic, and also said that "white people" and Jewish people are "the true savages". Fox confirmed that Cannon has apologized and is remorseful for his words, which lacked understanding and context, and inadvertently promoted hate. The network believes that this moment calls for dialogue and will help Cannon advance the conversation. In contrast, ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning bigotry of any kind and stating that Cannon failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon's apology came after initial refusal, and he has since taken steps to educate himself and make amends. Fox condemns all forms of hate directed towards any community and will combat bigotry of any kind.

END OF SUMMARY.
