SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had made the comments during an episode where he spoke with Professor Griff, who has a history of making anti-Semitic remarks. Fox stated that Cannon is "clear and remorseful" about his words and has taken steps to educate himself and make amends. The network condemned all forms of hate and bigotry, but believes that Cannon's apology and willingness to learn warrant him staying on the show. This decision comes after ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon has since issued a more sincere apology and announced that he will be taking time off from his morning radio show to further educate himself.

END OF SUMMARY.
