SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his recent anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and referred to white people and Jewish people as "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon finally issued a statement expressing remorse and a commitment to education and dialogue. Fox has accepted his apology and will continue to work with him, stating that they condemn all forms of hate and will combat bigotry. In contrast, ViacomCBS has terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. The incident highlights the importance of acknowledging and apologizing for harmful words and actions, and the need for education and dialogue to combat bigotry and hate.

END OF SUMMARY.
