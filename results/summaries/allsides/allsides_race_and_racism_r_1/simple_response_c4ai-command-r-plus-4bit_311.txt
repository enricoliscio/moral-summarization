SUMMARY: Fox has decided to allow Nick Cannon to remain on their show "The Masked Singer" despite making anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". During the episode, Cannon and his guest, Professor Griff, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks, espoused anti-Semitic theories and made false claims about black people being unable to be anti-Semitic. Cannon also stated that "white people" and Jewish people are "savages". While Fox acknowledged that Cannon's comments were "wrong and lacked understanding," they chose to keep him on the show, citing his remorse and willingness to educate himself. They plan to work with Cannon to advance a conversation about combating bigotry. ViacomCBS, however, terminated their relationship with Cannon, expressing disappointment in his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize and demanded an apology from ViacomCBS, but eventually issued a statement expressing remorse for his hurtful words and committing to educating himself about the Jewish experience. He also announced a break from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. The decision by Fox to keep Cannon on their show has sparked discussions about the appropriate response to such incidents, with some prominent figures supporting Cannon's educational approach.
END OF SUMMARY.
