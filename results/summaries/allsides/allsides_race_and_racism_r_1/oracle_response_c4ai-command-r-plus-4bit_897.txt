SUMMARY: Fox is allowing Nick Cannon to remain on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments, saying that he is "clear and remorseful" about his comments and that he will "advance this important conversation, broadly." In a June 30 episode of his podcast, Cannon and Professor Griff pushed anti-Semitic theories and claimed that black people cannot be anti-Semitic. Cannon also said that "white people" and Jewish people are "the true savages." While Fox acknowledged that Cannon's words lacked understanding and context and inadvertently promoted hate, they also stated that he has sincerely apologized and taken steps to educate himself and make amends. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated its relationship with Cannon, stating that they condemn all forms of hate and bigotry and are "deeply troubled" by Cannon's failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon has since issued multiple apologies and demanded an apology from ViacomCBS, while also refusing to apologize in certain instances, stating that apologies are empty and what is needed is healing and discussion. Cannon will be taking time away from his morning radio show to commit to reflection and education. He has received support from prominent figures such as Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs.
END OF SUMMARY.
