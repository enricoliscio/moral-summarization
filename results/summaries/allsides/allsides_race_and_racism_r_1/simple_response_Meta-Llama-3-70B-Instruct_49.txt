SUMMARY:

Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon as the host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments on his podcast "Cannon's Class". Cannon had made offensive remarks, claiming that black people cannot be anti-Semitic and that Jewish people and "white people" are "the true savages". After initially refusing to apologize, Cannon eventually issued a statement expressing remorse and a commitment to education and healing. Fox has accepted his apology and will continue to work with him, stating that they condemn all forms of hate and will combat bigotry. In contrast, ViacomCBS has terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his perpetuation of anti-Semitism. The incident highlights the importance of acknowledging and apologizing for harmful words and actions, and the need for education and dialogue to combat hate and bigotry.
