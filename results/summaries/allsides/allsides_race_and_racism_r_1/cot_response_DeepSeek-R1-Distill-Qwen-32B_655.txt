Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They want me to first identify all the morally framed words in the provided article, and then summarize the article while preserving those moral terms. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Nick Cannon making anti-Semitic comments on his podcast and the reactions from Fox and ViacomCBS. Fox decided to keep him on "The Masked Singer," while ViacomCBS terminated their relationship. Cannon later apologized but initially refused, and there's some pushback from the public on his apology's adequacy.

For STEP 1, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. I'll go through the article sentence by sentence. Words like "anti-Semitic," "anti-white," "condemns," "hate," "remorseful," "apologized," "educate," "condemns," "bigotry," "troubled," "apologize," "perpetuating," "apologies," "empty," "bow down," "healing," "discussion," "corrected," "grow," "sincere," "hurtful," "divisive," "stereotypes," "ashamed," "uninformed," "naive," "eye-opening," "gratitude," "chastising," "assure," "education," "connections," "learning," "strengthening," "bond," "reflection," "public," "backlash," "inadequate," "defended," "solidarity," "statement," "condemns," "bigotry," "troubled," "apologize," "perpetuating," "apologies," "empty," "bow down," "healing," "discussion," "corrected," "grow," "sincere," "hurtful," "divisive," "stereotypes," "ashamed," "uninformed," "naive," "eye-opening," "gratitude," "chastising," "assure," "education," "connections," "learning," "strengthening," "bond," "reflection."

Wait, some of these might be repeated or not single words. I need to make sure each is a single word and relevant to moral framing. For example, "anti-Semitic" is a moral term, as is "condemns." I'll list each one, ensuring they're single words and carry moral weight.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many moral terms as possible. I'll start by mentioning Fox allowing Cannon to stay on the show despite his comments. Then, note ViacomCBS terminating their relationship. Highlight Cannon's apology and his initial refusal, then his commitment to education. Also, mention Fox's support and Cannon's backing from others. Keep the tone neutral but include the moral framing words to reflect the article's stance.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points without being too verbose. I'll structure it by first stating Fox's decision, then ViacomCBS's reaction, followed by Cannon's apology process and the support he's receiving. This should cover the main events and the moral aspects highlighted in the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Nick Cannon remained on "The Masked Singer" after Fox decided to keep him, despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments during a podcast interview with Richard Griffin. Cannon apologized, expressing remorse for his words, which he acknowledged were wrong and promoted hate. Fox supported his commitment to education and dialogue, while ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with him, citing his failure to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Cannon initially refused to apologize, calling apologies "empty," but later issued a more sincere statement, vowing to learn and strengthen connections with the Jewish community. He also took a hiatus from his radio show to reflect and educate himself. Cannon has been defended by figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs. END OF SUMMARY.
