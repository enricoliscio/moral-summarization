SUMMARY: Fox has decided to keep Nick Cannon on as host of "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic and anti-white comments made during a podcast interview with Professor Griff, who has a history of anti-Semitism. Fox accepted Cannon's apology, in which he expressed remorse for his words and vowed to educate himself and foster dialogue between communities. Fox condemned all forms of hate and bigotry and aims to facilitate this important conversation with Nick. ViacomCBS, on the other hand, terminated its relationship with Cannon, citing his failure to acknowledge and apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism. Nick Cannon has since taken responsibility for his hurtful words and pledged to commit himself to learning and strengthening bonds between cultures. He will take time away from his radio show to focus on reflection and education. Prominent figures have supported his decision to educate himself and foster discussion. 

END OF SUMMARY.
