Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about Nick Cannon and his comments, along with specific instructions on how to summarize it. The key points are to preserve the moral framing and use as many of the provided morally charged words as possible. 

First, I need to understand the article thoroughly. It's about Fox allowing Nick Cannon to stay on "The Masked Singer" despite his anti-Semitic comments. The article mentions his podcast where he made these comments, Fox's response, ViacomCBS terminating their contract, Cannon's initial refusal to apologize, and his later apology. 

The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I need to incorporate as many as possible into the summary. Words like "comments," "pushed," "claimed," "said," "words," "lacked," "promoted," "apologized," "educate," "amends," "condemns," "hate," "directed," "combat," "bigotry," "failed," "perpetuating," "antisemitism," "refusing," "demanded," "ordered," "refused," "forcing," "making," "rhetoric," "healing," "discussion," "apologies," "reinforced," "help," "chastising."

I should structure the summary to include the main events: Cannon's comments, Fox's decision, ViacomCBS's termination, Cannon's initial refusal and later apology, and his commitment to education. I need to ensure that each event is described using the moral terms provided.

I'll start by mentioning Cannon's comments and who he made them with. Then Fox's response, their dialogue, Cannon's apology, and their decision to keep him. Next, ViacomCBS's reaction and their reasons. Then, Cannon's initial refusal and his later statements, including his commitment to education and time away from his show. Finally, mention the support he's received.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate without forcing them in. For example, "pushed anti-Semitic theories," "claimed," "condemns," "failed," "perpetuating," "refused," "demanded," "refused," "forcing," "chastising."

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each part is covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll present it as per the user's instructions, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Nick Cannon made anti-Semitic and anti-white comments during a podcast interview with Professor Griff, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks. Cannon claimed that black people couldn't be anti-Semitic and called Jewish and white people "true savages." Fox allowed Cannon to remain on *The Masked Singer*, stating he was remorseful and committed to education and dialogue. ViacomCBS terminated its relationship with Cannon, condemning his comments and his failure to apologize. Cannon initially refused to apologize, saying apologies were "empty," but later issued a statement apologizing and committing to learning and healing. He also took time away from his radio show to reflect and educate himself. Cannon has been supported by figures like Charlamagne tha God and Sean 'Diddy' Combs. END OF SUMMARY.
