SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants, regardless of status, bring specialized skills and have founded many profitable companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded businesses selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs ignore the fact that they pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive. The article also debunks the correlation between crime and immigration, citing a study that found native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born counterparts. The current U.S. citizenship process is unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted, encouraging unlawful alternatives. The article concludes that immigrants are what made America great in the past and will make it great again in the future, and native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, not disparage them.
