SUMMARY:

Contrary to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have been the backbone of America's "greatness" since its inception. They have not only helped build the country but have sustained it, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses have created millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded businesses selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs like Medicare ignore the fact that they pay $13.8 billion more into the system than they receive. Moreover, native-born residents are more likely to engage in wrongdoing, and the true danger to citizens is the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process that incentivizes unlawful alternatives. Rather than disparaging immigrants, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, recognizing that they are what made America great in the past and will make it great again in the future.
