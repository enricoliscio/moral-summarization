SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants, regardless of status, bring specialized skills and have founded many profitable companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue. Critics often ignore these facts and instead claim that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but a study found that they actually contribute more to Medicare than they receive. The article also debunks the myth that immigrants are prone to crime, citing a study that shows native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated. The current citizenship process is unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted, incentivizing unlawful alternatives. The article concludes that immigrants are what made America great in the past and will continue to do so in the future, and that native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, not disparage them.
