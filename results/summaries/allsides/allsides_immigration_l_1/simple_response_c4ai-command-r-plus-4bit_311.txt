SUMMARY: America's greatness is built on immigration. Contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have built and sustained the nation, introducing specialized skills and founding successful companies. Studies show that immigrant-founded businesses contribute significantly to the economy, generating millions of jobs and selling billions of dollars worth of goods annually. Arguments against immigration, such as abuse of social programs and correlation with crime, are refuted by research showing that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The danger lies not in immigrants but in the bureaucratic citizenship process that incentivizes unlawful alternatives. Public safety and health risks increase with prolonged human smuggling. Rather than rounding up undocumented immigrants or building walls, we should welcome immigrants as they are essential to America's past and future greatness. Immigrants contribute to America's greatness by bringing skills, founding successful companies, and contributing to the economy. Arguments against immigration are refuted by research showing their positive impact. The danger lies in bureaucratic processes that push people towards unlawful alternatives. Public safety and economic sense favor welcoming immigrants, who are integral to America's past and future greatness.
