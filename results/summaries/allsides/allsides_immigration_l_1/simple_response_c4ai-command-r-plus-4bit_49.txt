SUMMARY: Immigrants have always been instrumental in making America great. Contrary to the negative rhetoric of politicians like Donald Trump, immigrants have built and sustained the nation. They bring specialized skills, found successful companies, and create millions of jobs. Studies show that immigrants contribute more to social programs like Medicare than they take, and that native-born citizens are more likely to commit crimes. The real danger to citizens is not immigrants, but an unnecessarily complex citizenship process that encourages unlawful alternatives and puts people's safety and health at risk. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and costly, and building a wall is a pointless government project. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and those who don't are often visa overstayers seeking freedom and opportunity. We should welcome immigrants, not disparage them, as they are what will make America great again. END OF SUMMARY.
