SUMMARY: America's greatness has always been tied to immigration, and immigrants have been instrumental in building and sustaining the nation. They bring specialized skills and have founded some of the country's most successful companies, contributing to millions of jobs and services. Studies show that immigrants, including undocumented ones, contribute more to programs like Medicare than they take, and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The current complex and bureaucratic citizenship process is a greater danger to citizens, as it encourages unlawful alternatives and creates public safety risks. Instead of disparaging immigrants, we should welcome them, recognizing their vital role in America's past and future greatness. We must focus on practical solutions that recognize the value immigrants bring, rather than wasting resources on pointless projects like a border wall. Immigrants are not the problem, they are an essential part of the solution, and their contributions should be celebrated. END OF SUMMARY.
