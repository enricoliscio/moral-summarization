Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article talks about how immigrants contribute to America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. I should highlight the positive contributions, like building and sustaining the country, and mention the companies founded by immigrants. I'll also need to include the statistics about Fortune 500 companies and the economic benefits. 

The author criticizes those who ignore the positive aspects and instead focus on negatives like abusing social programs. I should note the study showing immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they take. Also, the part about crime rates being lower among immigrants compared to native-born should be included to counter that argument.

The article also points out the flaws in the citizenship process, calling it unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted. I should mention how this leads to problems like underground economies and smuggling. The conclusion emphasizes welcoming immigrants for their role in making America great now and in the future.

I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible, like "sustained," "ignore," "abuse," "study," "wrongdoing," "unnecessarily," "bureaucratic," "convoluted," "underground," "smuggling," "encouraged," "prolonged," "subsidized," "overstayed," "freedom," "hardship," and "disparage." 

I'll structure the summary to first state the main point, then go through the contributions, the counterarguments, and the flaws in the system, ending with the call to welcome immigrants. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all key points.

SUMMARY:  
The article argues that immigrants are central to America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric by highlighting their contributions to building and sustaining the nation. Immigrants bring specialized skills, founding many of America's most profitable companies, including Budweiser and McDonald’s, and 40% of Fortune 500 businesses trace their origins to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions in revenue. Critics often ignore these facts, instead focusing on undocumented immigrants supposedly abusing social programs like Medicare. However, a study shows undocumented immigrants contribute $13.8 billion more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Similarly, native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born individuals, debunking the link between immigration and crime. The article criticizes the U.S. citizenship process as unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted, which discourages lawful immigration and encourages underground economies and smuggling. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, come to the U.S. seeking freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship. Welcoming them is essential for maintaining America’s greatness, as immigrants have always been and will continue to be its foundation. END OF SUMMARY.
