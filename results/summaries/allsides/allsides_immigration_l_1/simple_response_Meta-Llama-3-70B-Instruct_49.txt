SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding successful companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions of dollars in goods annually. Critics' claims about undocumented immigrants abusing social programs and committing crimes are debunked by studies showing they contribute more to Medicare than they receive and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The article concludes that the current citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to unintended social consequences. Instead of building walls and rounding up undocumented immigrants, the US should welcome them and reform the citizenship process to ensure public safety and health.
