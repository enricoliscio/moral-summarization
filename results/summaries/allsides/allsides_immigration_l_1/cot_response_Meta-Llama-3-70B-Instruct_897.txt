SUMMARY:
Immigrants are the backbone of America's "greatness." Despite anti-immigrant rhetoric, the truth is that immigrants have built and sustained the country. They bring specialized skills, founding companies like Budweiser and McDonald's, and creating millions of jobs. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses were founded by immigrants or their offspring. Immigrants also contribute to Medicare, paying $13.8 billion more than they receive. Native-born residents, on the other hand, receive $30.9 billion more than they contribute, resulting in a deficit. The real "danger" is not immigrants, but the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process. Instead of building walls, the focus should be on welcoming immigrants who come to the US for "freedom" and "opportunity." They are what made America "great" in the past and will make it "great" again in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
