SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses have immigrant roots, generating millions of jobs and services. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs are misguided, as they actually contribute to Medicare and are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. The current U.S. citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to unintended social consequences. Rounding up undocumented immigrants and building a wall are impractical and irresponsible solutions. Instead, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants who come to the U.S. for freedom and opportunity, as they are essential to making America great again.
