SUMMARY: Immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness and have sustained its prosperity. Contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants introduce specialized skills and have founded some of America's most successful companies. They contribute to the economy through innovative businesses, generating millions of jobs and services. Critics ignore these contributions and instead falsely accuse undocumented immigrants of abusing social programs and committing crimes. Studies show that undocumented immigrants actually pay more into Medicare than they receive and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The true danger lies in the unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which pushes people towards unlawful alternatives and prolongs human smuggling. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and building a wall is a pointless, subsidized government project. Most immigrants reside lawfully, and those who overstay their visas are seeking freedom and opportunity. We should welcome immigrants, not disparage them, as they are what made and will continue to make America great.
