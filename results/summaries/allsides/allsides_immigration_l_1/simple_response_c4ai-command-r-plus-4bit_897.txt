SUMMARY: America's greatness is deeply intertwined with immigration, and immigrants have not only built but also sustained the nation. They bring specialized skills and contribute to the economy through innovative businesses and job creation. Contrary to critics' claims, undocumented immigrants do not abuse social programs like Medicare but instead contribute more financially than they receive. Crime rates are also not correlated with immigration status, as studies show that native-born citizens are more likely to be incarcerated. The real danger lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which pushes people towards unlawful alternatives and creates public safety risks. Instead of wasting resources on pointless projects like building a wall, we should embrace the positive impact of immigrants and recognize their crucial role in America's past and future greatness. Lawmakers and citizens alike should welcome immigrants and appreciate their pursuit of freedom and opportunity. END OF SUMMARY.
