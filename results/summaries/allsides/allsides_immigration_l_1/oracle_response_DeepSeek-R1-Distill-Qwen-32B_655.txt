Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is arguing that immigrants are essential to America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. They mention immigrants contributing to the economy, founding major companies, and paying more into Medicare than they receive. There's also a point about the bureaucracy in the citizenship process leading to negative outcomes like smuggling.

I need to highlight the moral aspects. Words like "rhetoric," "sustained," "abuse," "pay," "correlate," "wrongdoing," "danger," "bureaucratic," "incentivizing," "unlawful," "crime," "risks," "increase," "smuggling," "encouraged," "prolonged," "calls," "increased," "irresponsible," "drowning," "freedom," "hardship," "welcome," and "disparage" are key.

I should structure the summary to first state the importance of immigrants, then address the economic contributions, counter the critics' arguments, discuss the bureaucracy issues, and conclude with a call to welcome immigrants.

I'll start by mentioning the common denominator being immigrants, countering Trump's rhetoric. Then, talk about the economy, using the Fortune 500 stats. Next, address critics' claims about Medicare and crime, citing the studies. Then, discuss the bureaucratic process leading to smuggling and other risks. Finally, conclude by emphasizing welcoming immigrants for the future.

I need to make sure each sentence includes the moral terms without making it too wordy. Let me draft a few sentences and check the word count.

1. Immigrants are central to America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.
2. They sustain the economy, founding major companies and contributing significantly.
3. Critics wrongly correlate immigration with crime and Medicare abuse, but studies show immigrants pay more into Medicare and have lower crime rates.
4. The bureaucratic citizenship process incentivizes unlawful alternatives, increasing smuggling and public risks.
5. Welcoming immigrants is key to America's future, as they flee hardship for freedom.

That should cover the main points with the moral framing. Now, I'll make it concise, around 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Immigrants are central to America's greatness, countering Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. They have sustained the nation's growth, founding major companies and contributing $857 billion annually. Critics wrongly correlate immigration with crime and Medicare abuse, but studies show undocumented immigrants pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes, with native-born males being 10 times more likely to be incarcerated. The current citizenship process is bureaucratic, incentivizing unlawful alternatives like smuggling, which prolongs public safety risks. Building a wall or deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical and irresponsible, especially as many simply overstayed visas. Immigrants seek freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship. Welcoming them, rather than disparaging them, is key to America's future greatness.  
END OF SUMMARY.
