SUMMARY: Contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have sustained America's greatness and contributed to its success. They bring specialized skills and have founded or co-founded many profitable companies, including some of the most well-known brands. Immigrant-founded businesses contribute significantly to the economy, generating millions of jobs and selling billions of dollars worth of goods annually. Critics often ignore these contributions and instead falsely accuse undocumented immigrants of abusing social programs and increasing crime rates. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and that native-born citizens are much more likely to commit crimes. The real danger lies in the bureaucratic citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful behavior and puts public safety and health at risk. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and calls for increased government spending are irresponsible, especially considering the nation's debt. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and those who don't are often visa overstayers seeking freedom and opportunity. Instead of disparaging them, we should welcome immigrants as they are what made and will continue to make America great.
