SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding successful companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions of dollars in goods annually. Critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs are misinformed, as studies show they contribute more to Medicare than they receive. Additionally, native-born males are more likely to commit crimes than their foreign-born counterparts. The article concludes that the current U.S. citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to unintended social consequences. Rather than building walls or deporting immigrants, the focus should be on welcoming them and providing a clear path to citizenship.
