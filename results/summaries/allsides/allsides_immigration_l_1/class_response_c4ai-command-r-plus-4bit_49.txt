SUMMARY: Immigrants have always been the backbone of America's greatness, and their contributions cannot be overstated. Contrary to popular anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants not only built America but continue to sustain it. They bring specialized skills, found successful companies, and create millions of jobs. Studies show that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive and are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. The true danger lies in an unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process that drives people to unlawful alternatives, incentivizing human smuggling and creating public safety risks. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and calls for increased government spending are irresponsible. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and those who don't often overstay their visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. We should welcome immigrants, not disparage them, as they are what made and will continue to make America great.

END OF SUMMARY.
