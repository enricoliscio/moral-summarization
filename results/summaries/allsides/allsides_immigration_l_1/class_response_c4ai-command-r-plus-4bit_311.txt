SUMMARY: Immigrants have always been the common denominator of America's greatness. Despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, the truth is that immigrants have built and sustained the nation. They introduce specialized skills and have founded some of America's most successful companies, with roughly 40% of Fortune 500 businesses tracing their beginnings to immigrants. Immigrant-founded businesses contribute millions of jobs and services, selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing nearly 4 million workers. Critics often ignore these contributions, choosing instead to argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs and correlate immigration with crime. However, studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and that native-born residents are far more likely to end up incarcerated than their foreign-born counterparts. The true danger lies in the unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives and prolongs human smuggling. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical, and calls for increased government spending on projects like a border wall are irresponsible. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and many who don't have simply overstayed their visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants, not disparage them, as they are what made and will continue to make America great. END OF SUMMARY.
