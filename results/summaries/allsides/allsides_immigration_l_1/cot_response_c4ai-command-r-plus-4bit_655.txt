SUMMARY: America's greatness was built by immigrants, and it will continue to be so in the future. Contrary to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have brought invaluable contributions to the country. They introduce specialized skills and have founded some of America's most successful companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's. Additionally, immigrant-founded businesses contribute significantly to the economy, generating millions of jobs and selling billions of dollars worth of goods annually. Critics often ignore these benefits and instead focus on negative stereotypes and misconceptions. They argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs like Medicare, but studies show that they contribute more than they receive. Similarly, the correlation between immigration and crime is unfounded, as native-born citizens are significantly more likely to be incarcerated. The real danger lies in the current bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which pushes people towards unlawful and desperate measures. Prolonged human smuggling endangers public safety and health. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and wasteful, and building a wall is an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and even those who overstay their visas are seeking freedom, opportunity, and a chance to escape hardship. Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants instead of disparaging them. Immigrants are what made America great, and they will continue to play a crucial role in its future success.
