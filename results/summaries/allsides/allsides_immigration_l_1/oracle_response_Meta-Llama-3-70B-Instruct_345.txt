SUMMARY:

Contrary to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have been the backbone of America's "greatness" since its inception. They have not only helped build the country but have also sustained it. Immigrants, regardless of status, bring specialized skills and have founded some of America's most profitable companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses have created millions of jobs and services, and immigrant-founded businesses sell $857 billion in goods annually and employ almost 4 million workers. Critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse domestic social programs ignore the fact that they pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive. Moreover, native-born residents are more likely to engage in wrongdoing and crime than their foreign-born counterparts. The current U.S. citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, incentivizing unlawful alternatives and creating public safety and health risks. Instead of disparaging immigrants, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them and recognize their contributions to America's greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
