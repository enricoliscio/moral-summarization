SUMMARY: Despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have played a crucial role in building and sustaining America's greatness. They bring specialized skills, and many successful companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's, were founded by immigrants or their offspring. Immigrant-founded businesses contribute significantly to the economy, generating millions of jobs and selling billions of dollars in goods annually. Studies show that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The complex and bureaucratic citizenship process can incentivize unlawful alternatives, and a focus on rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and ignores the benefits they bring. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and those who don't are often visa overstayers seeking freedom and opportunity. America should welcome immigrants, as they are what made and will continue to make America great.
