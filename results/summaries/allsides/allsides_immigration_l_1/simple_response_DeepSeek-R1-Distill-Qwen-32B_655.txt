Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing the author used. The article is about how immigrants are essential to America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. It gives examples of companies founded by immigrants, like Budweiser and McDonald's, and mentions that 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant roots. It also talks about how undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they take, and that native-born people are more likely to commit crimes. The author argues against building a wall and the current citizenship process, saying it's too complicated and leads to problems like human smuggling.

First, I should identify the key points: immigrants built and sustain America, their contributions to the economy, the myth about social program abuse, crime rates, the flaws in the citizenship process, and the moral argument for welcoming immigrants.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and preserves the moral tone. I'll start by stating the main idea that immigrants are crucial to America's success. Then mention the economic contributions, the myth about social programs, crime rates, and the problems with the current system. Finally, conclude with the moral call to welcome immigrants.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, make sure to highlight the positive contributions and counter the negative myths. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes that immigrants are fundamental to America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the nation, contributing specialized skills and founding many of its most profitable companies, including 40% of Fortune 500 businesses. They generate billions in revenue and millions of jobs annually. Contrary to myths, undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Crime rates are also lower among immigrants, with native-born males being 10 times more likely to be incarcerated. The article criticizes the complex citizenship process, which discourages lawful immigration and fosters illegal activities. Building a wall is deemed ineffective and costly. Immigrants seek freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship, and should be welcomed rather than disparaged. The author argues that immigrants are essential to America's past greatness and future potential. END OF SUMMARY.
