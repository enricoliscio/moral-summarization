SUMMARY: America's *greatness* was built by immigrants. They helped build a *shining* city upon a hill and have *sustained* it ever since. Immigrants introduce specialized skills and have founded some of America's most profitable companies, contributing to millions of jobs and countless services. Critics argue that *undocumented* immigrants *abuse* social programs and commit crimes, but studies show that they pay more into Medicare than they receive and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The real *danger* to citizens is the *current* US citizenship process, which is *unnecessarily bureaucratic* and *convoluted*, leading to *applicants falling through administrative cracks* and lingering paperwork that incentivizes *unlawful* and *desperate alternatives*. *History* has shown that *underground economies* and unintended *social consequences* can arise from prolonged human smuggling. *Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical*, and increased government spending on a wall is *irresponsible* in a nation *drowning in debt*. Most immigrants *reside lawfully* in the US, and many who don't have simply *overstayed their visas*. They come to America seeking *freedom* and *opportunity*, a chance to escape *hardship*. We should *welcome* them, not *disparage* them. Immigrants are what made America *great* in the past and will make it *great again* in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
