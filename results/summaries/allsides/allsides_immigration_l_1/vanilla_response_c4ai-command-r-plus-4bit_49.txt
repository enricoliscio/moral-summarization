SUMMARY: America's greatness has been built and sustained by immigrants, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants bring specialized skills and have founded many successful companies, including some of America's most well-known brands. They contribute significantly to the economy, with immigrant-founded businesses selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing millions of workers. Studies show that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The current bureaucratic citizenship process is a danger to public safety and health, encouraging human smuggling and unlawful alternatives. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and costly, and building a wall is a pointless government project. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and many undocumented immigrants overstay their visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. Immigrants have made America great in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
