SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses have immigrant roots, generating millions of jobs and services. Critics' claims about undocumented immigrants abusing social programs and committing crimes are debunked by studies showing they contribute more to Medicare than they receive and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The current U.S. citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, incentivizing unlawful alternatives and creating public safety and health risks. Rounding up undocumented immigrants and building a wall are impractical and irresponsible. Instead, lawmakers should welcome immigrants who come to the U.S. for freedom and opportunity, as they are essential to making America great again.
