SUMMARY: America's greatness has been built by immigrants. Contrary to Donald Trump’s incessant anti-immigrant rhetoric, the truth is that immigrants have helped build and sustain what Ronald Reagan once called a “shining" city. They bring specialized skills and have founded some of America’s most celebrated companies, including Budweiser and McDonald’s. According to a report, roughly 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their roots to immigrants. These businesses have produced millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded firms selling $857 billion in annual goods and employing nearly 4 million people. Critics argue that undocumented immigrants abuse domestic programs and increase crime rates. However, studies show that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive and are far less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The real danger lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful and desperate measures. Public safety is at risk due to prolonged human smuggling. Rounding up 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical and costly. Most immigrants reside lawfully, and many undocumented immigrants simply overstay their visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. We should welcome immigrants, not disparage them, as they are what made and will continue to make America great. END OF SUMMARY.
