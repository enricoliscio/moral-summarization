SUMMARY:

Contrary to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have been the backbone of America's greatness, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses produce millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded businesses selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but a study found they pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive, resulting in a surplus. Native-born residents, on the other hand, receive $30.9 billion more than they contribute, resulting in a deficit. The true danger to native-born citizens is not immigrants, but the bureaucratic and convoluted U.S. citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives. Instead of building walls and disparaging immigrants, we should welcome them and provide a pathway to citizenship, ensuring America's continued greatness.
