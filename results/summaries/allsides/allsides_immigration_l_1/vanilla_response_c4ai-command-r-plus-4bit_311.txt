SUMMARY: Despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have played a crucial role in building and sustaining America's greatness. They bring specialized skills and contribute to the economy through the formation of new businesses, with roughly 40% of Fortune 500 companies being founded by immigrants or their offspring. Immigrant-founded businesses generate millions of jobs and sell $857 billion in goods annually. Studies show that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The current bureaucratic citizenship process is a greater danger to citizens, encouraging unlawful alternatives and creating public safety risks. Instead of disparaging immigrants, we should recognize their positive impact on the country and welcome them as an integral part of America's future success.
