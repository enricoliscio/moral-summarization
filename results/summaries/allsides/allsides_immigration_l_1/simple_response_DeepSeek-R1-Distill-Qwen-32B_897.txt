Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article talks about how immigrants contribute to America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. I should highlight the positive contributions, like founding major companies and the economic benefits. Also, I need to address the critics' points about social programs and crime, showing that immigrants don't abuse them. The summary should end by emphasizing that immigration is key to America's future. I'll keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all main points.

SUMMARY:  
The article argues that immigrants are essential to America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the nation, founding many of its top companies, including Budweiser and McDonald’s, and contributing to 40% of Fortune 500 businesses. Immigrant-founded businesses generate $857 billion in goods annually and employ nearly 4 million workers. Critics often focus on undocumented immigrants abusing social programs, but studies show they contribute more to Medicare than they receive, unlike native-born residents. Additionally, native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born individuals. The article criticizes the U.S. citizenship process as overly bureaucratic, leading to unlawful alternatives and public safety risks. Building a wall is deemed impractical and wasteful, as most undocumented immigrants overstayed visas. Immigrants seek freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship, and should be welcomed. The article concludes that immigrants are key to America’s past and future greatness.  
END OF SUMMARY.
