SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions of dollars in goods annually. Critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs or commit crimes are misinformed. Studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive, and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The article concludes that the current U.S. citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to unintended social consequences. Instead of building walls or rounding up undocumented immigrants, lawmakers should welcome immigrants who come to the U.S. for freedom and opportunity.
