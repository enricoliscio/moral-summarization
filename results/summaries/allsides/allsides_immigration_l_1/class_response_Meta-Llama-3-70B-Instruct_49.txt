SUMMARY:

Contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have been the backbone of America's greatness, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses have created millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded businesses selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics often ignore these facts, instead arguing that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs like Medicare. However, studies show that undocumented immigrants pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive, resulting in a surplus. The true danger lies in the unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives and creates public safety and health risks. Rather than disparaging immigrants, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, recognizing that they are what made America great in the past and will make it great again in the future.
