Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language.

The article starts by saying immigrants are key to America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It emphasizes that immigrants built and sustained the country, using Reagan's "shining city upon a hill." The author mentions companies like Budweiser and McDonald's founded by immigrants, and 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant roots. Immigrants contribute $857 billion and employ 4 million workers. 

Critics argue undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but the article counters with a study showing they pay more into Medicare than they receive. Native-born residents actually take more out. Another point is that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated than immigrants. 

The author criticizes the citizenship process as bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to unlawful alternatives and increased risks like smuggling. They compare it to prohibition leading to crime. The article opposes rounding up undocumented immigrants and building walls, calling such measures impractical and irresponsible. It points out that most undocumented immigrants overstayed visas, not entered illegally. The conclusion is that immigrants should be welcomed, not disparaged, as they are essential for America's future greatness.

Now, I need to create a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes as many of the author's morally framed words as possible. I should highlight the positive contributions of immigrants, counter the critics' arguments, and critique the current policies. I'll make sure to use words like rhetoric, sustained, abuse, pay, correlate, wrongdoing, danger, bureaucratic, incentivizing, unlawful, crime, risks, increase, smuggling, encouraged, prolonged, irresponsible, welcome, disparage.

I'll structure the summary to first state the positive role of immigrants, then address the critics' points and refute them, then discuss the problematic policies and their consequences, and finally conclude with the call to welcome immigrants.
