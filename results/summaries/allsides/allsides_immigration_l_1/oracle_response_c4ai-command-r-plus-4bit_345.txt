SUMMARY: Immigrants have always been the backbone of America's greatness. Despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, the truth is that immigrants have built and sustained the nation. They bring specialized skills and have founded some of America's most successful companies, contributing to the economy through innovation and job creation. Critics often ignore these benefits and instead falsely accuse undocumented immigrants of abusing social programs and increasing crime rates. However, studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and are less likely to end up incarcerated than native-born citizens. The real danger lies in the bureaucratic citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful behavior and prolongs human smuggling, creating public safety and health risks. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and expensive, and building a wall is a pointless government project. Most immigrants reside in the U.S. lawfully, and even those who overstay their visas are seeking freedom and opportunity. We should welcome immigrants, not disparage them, as they are what made and will continue to make America great.
END OF SUMMARY.
