Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the tone.

The article starts by saying that immigrants are the common thread in America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. It mentions that immigrants built and sustained America, citing examples like Budweiser and McDonald's, which were founded by immigrants or their children. It also refers to a report that 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant origins, contributing millions of jobs and billions in sales.

Then, it addresses critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs. The article counters this by stating that undocumented immigrants actually contribute more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. It also talks about crime rates, noting that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born ones.

The article criticizes the U.S. citizenship process as too bureaucratic, leading to underground economies and increased risks. It compares this to prohibition and organized crime, suggesting that impractical measures like rounding up undocumented immigrants or building walls are ineffective and costly.

Finally, the author argues that immigrants come for freedom and opportunity, and native-born citizens should welcome them, as immigrants are key to America's past and future greatness.

Now, I need to create a summary that captures all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should maintain the positive tone towards immigrants and the critical stance towards anti-immigrant policies. I'll structure it by highlighting the contributions of immigrants, refuting common criticisms, and criticizing the current immigration system. I'll make sure to include key statistics and the moral argument for welcoming immigrants.

Let me start drafting:

"Immigrants are central to America's greatness, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. They've built and sustained the nation, founding major companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. 40% of Fortune 500 companies trace their origins to immigrants, creating millions of jobs. Critics claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but they contribute $13.8 billion more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a $30.9 billion deficit. Native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born. The U.S. citizenship process is overly bureaucratic, leading to underground economies and increased risks, similar to prohibition-era crime. Deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical and costly. Most immigrants, documented or not, seek freedom and opportunity. Welcoming them is key to America's future greatness."

Wait, that's a bit long. Let me trim it down, maybe combine some sentences.

"Immigrants are central to America's greatness, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. They've built and sustained the nation, founding major companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. 40% of Fortune 500 companies trace their origins to immigrants, creating millions of jobs. Critics claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but they contribute $13.8 billion more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a $30.9 billion deficit. Native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born.

Deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical and costly. Most immigrants seek freedom and opportunity. Welcoming them is key to America's future greatness."

That's better. Now, check word count. Let me count the words:

1. Immigrants are central to America's greatness, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. (11 words)
2. They've built and sustained the nation, founding major companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. (15 words)
3. 40% of Fortune 500 companies trace their origins to immigrants, creating millions of jobs. (15 words)
4. Critics claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but they contribute $13.8 billion more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a $30.9 billion deficit. (30 words)
5. Native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born. (12 words)
6. The U.S. citizenship process is overly bureaucratic, leading to underground economies and increased risks, similar to prohibition-era crime. (20 words)
7. Deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical and costly. (12 words)
8. Most immigrants seek freedom and opportunity. (8 words)
9. Welcoming them is key to America's future greatness. (10 words)

Total: 11+15+15+30+12+20+12+8+10 = 143 words. Perfect, under 200.

Now, I'll present this as the summary.
