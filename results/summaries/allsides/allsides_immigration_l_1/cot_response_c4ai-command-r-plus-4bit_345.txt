SUMMARY: America's greatness was built and sustained by immigrants. Contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants—regardless of status—introduce specialized skills and contribute to the economy. Studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and have a lower incarceration rate than native-born citizens. The true danger lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful and desperate alternatives. Critics' claims about undocumented immigrants abusing social programs and correlating immigration with crime are unfounded. The true moral choice is to welcome immigrants, not disparage them. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and immoral in a nation drowning in debt. Most immigrants reside lawfully, and many who don't simply overstay their visas in pursuit of freedom and opportunity. Immigrants are what made America great, and they will make it great again.
