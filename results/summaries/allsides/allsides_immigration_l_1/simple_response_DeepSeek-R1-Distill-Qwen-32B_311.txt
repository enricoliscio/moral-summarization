Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the author's stance.

The article starts by stating that immigrants are the common thread in America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It emphasizes that immigrants built and sustained America, citing examples like Budweiser and McDonald's founded by immigrants or their offspring. The author mentions that 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant roots, contributing millions of jobs and billions in sales. 

Then, the article addresses critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs. It counters with a study showing undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. It also refutes the crime-immigration link, citing a study where native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born.

The author criticizes the U.S. citizenship process as overly bureaucratic, leading to delays and encouraging unlawful alternatives, drawing a parallel to prohibition-era crime. They argue that rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and building a wall is a wasteful project. The article concludes by highlighting that immigrants come for freedom and opportunity, urging acceptance and welcoming them as key to America's future greatness.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral points intact. I should include the positive contributions of immigrants, counter the critics' arguments with data, criticize the bureaucracy, and emphasize the importance of immigration for America's future.

I'll start by stating the main idea: immigrants are central to America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. Then mention the economic contributions, the companies founded by immigrants, and the jobs created. Address the critics by citing the study on Medicare and crime rates. Critique the citizenship process as a problem, not the immigrants. Conclude with the moral stance that immigrants are essential for America's greatness.

Let me structure this step by step to ensure all key points are covered concisely.
