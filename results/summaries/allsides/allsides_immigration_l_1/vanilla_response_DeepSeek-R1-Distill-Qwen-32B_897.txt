Okay, so I need to summarize this article about immigrants and their impact on America. The user wants a concise summary of no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by countering Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance, emphasizing that immigrants are crucial to America's success. It mentions that many successful companies, like Budweiser and McDonald's, were founded by immigrants or their descendants. The Partnership for a New American Economy report says 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant ties, contributing significantly to jobs and the economy.

Then, it addresses critics who argue about undocumented immigrants abusing social programs. The article cites a study showing undocumented immigrants actually contribute more to Medicare than they take out, unlike native-born residents who create a deficit. It also mentions that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born ones.

The article criticizes the U.S. citizenship process as too bureaucratic, leading to delays and encouraging illegal activities. It draws a parallel to prohibition and organized crime, suggesting strict immigration enforcement could have similar negative consequences. The author argues that rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and that building a wall is a costly mistake. Most immigrants, both legal and illegal, are seeking freedom and opportunity, so the article concludes that welcoming them is key to America's future greatness.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start by highlighting the main points: immigrants' role in building America's success, their contributions to the economy, countering myths about social programs and crime, criticizing the immigration system, and the conclusion about immigration's importance.

I should make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without getting too detailed.
