SUMMARY: America's greatness has always been tied to immigration. Despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have built and sustained the nation. They bring specialized skills and contribute to the economy, with many successful companies founded by immigrants or their offspring. Critics often criticize undocumented immigrants for abusing social programs and correlating immigration with crime. However, studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated. The danger lies not with immigrants but with the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which leads to unlawful and desperate alternatives. Human smuggling poses risks to public safety and health, and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants is impractical and irresponsible. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and many come for freedom, opportunity, and a chance to escape hardship. We should welcome them instead of disparaging them, as immigrants are what made America great in the past and will do so again in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
