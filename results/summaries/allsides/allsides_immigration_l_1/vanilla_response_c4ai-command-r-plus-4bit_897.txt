SUMMARY: America's greatness has always been tied to immigration, with immigrants contributing to the country's growth and success. Contrary to popular belief, immigrants bring specialized skills and have founded or co-founded some of America's most successful companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's. They also create new businesses, with 40% of Fortune 500 companies being directly or indirectly linked to immigration. These immigrant-founded businesses contribute millions of jobs and services, selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing nearly 4 million workers. Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive and are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. The current complex and bureaucratic citizenship process discourages lawful immigration and leads to unlawful alternatives. Improving the process and welcoming immigrants will ensure America's future greatness.
