SUMMARY:
Immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. The truth is that immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding celebrated companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. They have produced millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded businesses selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs or correlate crime with immigration are misguided. In reality, undocumented immigrants pay a surplus into Medicare, and native-born males are 10 times more likely to end up incarcerated. The current U.S. citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, incentivizing unlawful alternatives. Instead of disparaging immigrants, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, recognizing that they are what made America great in the past and will make it great again in the future.
