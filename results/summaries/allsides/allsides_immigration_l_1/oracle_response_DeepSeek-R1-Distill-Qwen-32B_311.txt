Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about how immigrants have been crucial to America's success, countering Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It mentions that immigrants built and sustained the country, contributing skills and starting successful businesses. Companies like Budweiser and McDonald's were founded by immigrants or their children. Immigrants also contribute more to Medicare than they take, which is a positive point. The article also addresses critics who correlate immigration with crime, but studies show native-born are more likely to commit crimes. The process for citizenship is too bureaucratic, leading to problems like unlawful alternatives and increased risks from smuggling. The author argues against rounding up undocumented immigrants and building walls, calling it impractical and irresponsible. Immigrants come for freedom and opportunity, and should be welcomed.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible: rhetoric, sustained, abuse, pay, correlate, wrongdoing, danger, continues, bureaucratic, incentivizing, unlawful, rise, crime, risks, increase, smuggling, encouraged, prolonged, calls, increased, irresponsible, drowning, building, overstayed, freedom, hardship, welcome, disparage.

I should structure the summary to highlight the positive contributions of immigrants and the negative impact of anti-immigrant policies. I'll mention the rhetoric, the sustained contributions, the payment into Medicare, the correlation of crime, the danger in the citizenship process, the bureaucratic issues, how that incentivizes unlawful actions, the rise in crime (though studies show it's not higher among immigrants), the increase in risks, smuggling, encouragement from prolonged issues, calls for increased spending which is irresponsible, the country drowning in debt, building a wall, overstayed visas, seeking freedom from hardship, and the call to welcome rather than disparage immigrants.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it concisely, making sure to include the key points and the moral words without making it too long.

SUMMARY: The article counters Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric by emphasizing immigrants' crucial role in building and sustaining America's greatness. Immigrants contribute specialized skills, founding many of the nation's most successful companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's. They also pay more into Medicare than they receive, unlike native-born residents, who create a deficit. Critics correlate immigration with crime, but studies show native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated. The current citizenship process is bureaucratic, incentivizing unlawful alternatives and prolonging smuggling risks. Rounding up undocumented immigrants and building walls are impractical and irresponsible, especially as the U.S. faces debt. Most undocumented immigrants overstayed visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants, recognizing their role in past and future American greatness, rather than disparaging them. END OF SUMMARY.
