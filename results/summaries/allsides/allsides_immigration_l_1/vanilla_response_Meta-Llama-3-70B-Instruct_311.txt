SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding successful companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses have immigrant roots, generating millions of jobs and services. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs are misinformed, as they actually contribute more to Medicare than they receive. The article also debunks the correlation between crime and immigration, citing a study that shows native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born counterparts. The current citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, encouraging unlawful alternatives. The article concludes that immigrants are essential to America's greatness, and native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, not disparage them.
