SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding successful companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs or commit crimes are misinformed. Studies show that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive, and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The current citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, incentivizing unlawful alternatives. Rather than building walls or rounding up immigrants, the US should welcome them and reform the citizenship process to ensure public safety and health. Immigrants have always made America great, and will continue to do so in the future.
