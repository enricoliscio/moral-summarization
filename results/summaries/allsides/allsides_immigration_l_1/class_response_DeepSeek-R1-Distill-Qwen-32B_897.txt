Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand its main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article emphasizes the positive role of immigrants in building and sustaining America. It counters Trump's anti-immigrant stance by highlighting the contributions of immigrants, including founding major companies and creating jobs. It also addresses critics who argue against immigrants using social programs, pointing out that immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive. The article also discusses the flaws in the U.S. citizenship process, leading to underground activities and public risks.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the article: sustained, ignore, abuse, study, wrongdoing, unnecessarily, bureaucratic, convoluted, underground, smuggling, encouraged, prolonged, subsidized—government, overstayed, freedom, hardship, disparage.

I should structure the summary to include these words while maintaining the article's message. I'll start by stating that immigrants are essential to America's greatness, countering Trump's rhetoric. Then, mention the economic contributions, referencing the study about Medicare. Next, address the flawed immigration system and its consequences. Finally, conclude by encouraging welcoming immigrants instead of disparaging them.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY:  
The article argues that immigrants are central to America's greatness, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric by emphasizing their role in building and sustaining the nation. Immigrants contribute specialized skills, founding iconic companies like Budweiser and McDonald’s, and 40% of Fortune 500 businesses trace their origins to immigrants. These businesses generate millions of jobs and billions in revenue. Critics often ignore these contributions, instead accusing undocumented immigrants of abusing social programs like Medicare. However, a study shows undocumented immigrants pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Claims linking immigration to crime are also unfounded, as studies show native-born males are more likely to commit wrongdoing. The U.S. citizenship process is unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted, discouraging lawful pathways and encouraging underground smuggling. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, seek freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship. Rounding up undocumented immigrants or building a wall is impractical and counterproductive. Instead, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants, recognizing their vital role in making America great. END OF SUMMARY.
