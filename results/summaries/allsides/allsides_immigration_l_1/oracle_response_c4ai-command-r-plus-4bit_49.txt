SUMMARY: Contrary to Donald Trumpâ€™s incessant anti-immigrant rhetoric, the truth is that immigrants have played a crucial role in building and sustaining America's greatness. They introduce specialized skills and have founded some of the country's most successful companies, contributing to millions of jobs and services. Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and are less likely to end up incarcerated than their native-born counterparts. The current bureaucratic citizenship process is the true danger, incentivizing unlawful alternatives and prolonging human smuggling, which poses risks to public safety and health. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and calls for increased government spending are irresponsible, especially when considering the positive impact immigrants have had on the country. Most immigrants reside in the U.S. lawfully, and those who don't often overstay their visas in search of freedom and opportunity. Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants instead of disparaging them. Immigrants are what made America great, and they will continue to play a vital role in the country's future success. END OF SUMMARY.
