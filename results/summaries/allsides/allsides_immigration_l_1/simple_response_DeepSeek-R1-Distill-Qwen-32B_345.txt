Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article starts by emphasizing that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. It highlights that immigrants built and sustained the country, citing examples like Budweiser and McDonald's, and mentions that 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their descendants. This shows the economic contribution of immigrants.

Next, the article addresses common criticisms: undocumented immigrants abusing social programs and increasing crime. It counters these by citing studies showing immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they take, and that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated. This argues against the notion that immigrants are a drain or a criminal threat.

The author then points out flaws in the U.S. citizenship process, comparing it to the prohibition era's underground economy. They argue that the current system leads to smuggling and public safety risks, making mass deportations impractical and costly.

Finally, the article concludes that welcoming immigrants is essential for America's future greatness, highlighting their pursuit of freedom and opportunity.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, maintaining the moral stance that immigrants are positive contributors and the system's issues are the real problem. I should include key points: economic contributions, debunking myths about social programs and crime, flaws in the immigration system, and the moral call to welcome immigrants.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the importance of immigrants, then addressing criticisms, followed by the system's flaws, and ending with the moral imperative. I'll ensure to use concise language while preserving the author's pro-immigrant message.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each paragraph is clear and within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it captures the essence without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article argues that immigrants are the foundation of America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the nation, contributing specialized skills and founding iconic companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. Approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies trace their origins to immigrants, generating millions of jobs and billions in revenue. Contrary to critics, undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Studies also show native-born males are more likely to commit crimes than immigrants. The U.S. immigration system, however, is overly bureaucratic, discouraging lawful pathways and encouraging unlawful alternatives, which risks public safety and health. Deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants is impractical, and building a wall is a costly, ineffective solution. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, seek freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship. Welcoming them is essential for America's future greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
