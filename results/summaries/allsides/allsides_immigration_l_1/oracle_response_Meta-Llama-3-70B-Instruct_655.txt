SUMMARY:

Contrary to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have been the backbone of America's greatness, introducing specialized skills and founding celebrated companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses have produced millions of jobs and services, selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants abuse domestic social programs ignore the fact that they pay $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive, resulting in a surplus. Meanwhile, native-born residents receive $30.9 billion more than they contribute, resulting in a deficit. The true danger to native-born citizens is not the foreign-born, but the bureaucratic and convoluted U.S. citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives and increases public safety and health risks. Rather than disparaging them, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants, who come to the U.S. for freedom and opportunity, and have made America great in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
