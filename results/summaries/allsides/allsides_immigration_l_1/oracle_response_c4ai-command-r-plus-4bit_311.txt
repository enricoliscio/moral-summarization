SUMMARY: Immigrants have always been the cornerstone of America's greatness. Despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, the truth is that immigrants have built and sustained the nation. They bring specialized skills, found successful companies, and create millions of jobs. Critics often ignore these contributions, instead focusing on unfounded claims that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs and contribute to crime. However, studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The real danger lies in the bureaucratic citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful behavior and prolongs human smuggling, creating public safety and health risks. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and calls for increased government spending are irresponsible given the nation's debt. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and those who don't often overstay their visas in search of freedom and opportunity. Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants instead of disparaging them. Immigrants are what made America great, and they will continue to play a crucial role in its future success.
