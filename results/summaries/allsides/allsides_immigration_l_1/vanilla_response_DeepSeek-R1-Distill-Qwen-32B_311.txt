Okay, so I need to summarize this article about immigrants and their role in America. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." They also mentioned that I'm an assistant, so I should make sure the summary is clear and captures the main points.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key arguments. The main points seem to be that immigrants have been crucial to America's success, despite Trump's anti-immigrant stance. The article mentions how many major companies were founded by immigrants or their children, and that immigrants contribute significantly to the economy. It also addresses common criticisms, like immigrants abusing social programs, but counters with data showing they contribute more to Medicare than they take. Additionally, it talks about the bureaucracy in the citizenship process and how that leads to problems like underground economies and crime, comparing it to prohibition.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: the positive contributions of immigrants, the economic impact, the refutation of common criticisms, and the issues with the current immigration system. I should keep it concise, so I'll need to condense each point without losing the essence.

I'll start by stating that immigrants are key to America's success, mention the companies founded by immigrants, the economic contributions, refute the criticisms with the Medicare example, and then touch on the flawed immigration system leading to issues. I'll make sure it's all within 200 words.

Wait, the original response I wrote was 198 words. That's good. I should check if it's clear and covers all the main points without being too wordy. Maybe I can make it a bit more concise if possible, but it seems to hit all the key areas. I think that's a solid summary.

SUMMARY: Immigrants have played a pivotal role in shaping America's success, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Many of the country's most profitable companies, including Budweiser and McDonaldâ€™s, were founded by immigrants or their descendants. Immigrant-founded businesses generate $857 billion in annual sales and employ nearly 4 million workers. Contrary to claims that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, they contribute $13.8 billion more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a $30.9 billion deficit. Studies also show that native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born individuals. The current immigration system, however, is overly bureaucratic, leading to delays and encouraging unlawful alternatives. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, seek freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship. Welcoming them is key to maintaining and restoring America's greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
