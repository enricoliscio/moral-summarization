SUMMARY:
Immigrants are the backbone of America's "greatness." Contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric, the "truth" is that immigrants have built and sustained the country. They bring specialized skills and have founded some of America's most "celebrated" and "profitable" companies. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses were founded by immigrants or their offspring. Immigrant-founded businesses generate $857 billion in goods annually and employ almost 4 million workers. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants "abuse" domestic social programs are misguided, as they actually contribute to a "surplus" in Medicare. The real "danger" lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives. Rather than disparaging immigrants, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, as they are essential to making America "great" again. END OF SUMMARY.
