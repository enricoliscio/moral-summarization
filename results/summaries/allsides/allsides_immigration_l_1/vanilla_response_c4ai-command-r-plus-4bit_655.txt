SUMMARY: America's greatness has been built and sustained by immigrants, who bring specialized skills and contribute to the economy through the formation of new businesses. Contrary to common criticism, studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The current bureaucratic citizenship process is a greater danger to citizens, as it encourages unlawful alternatives and prolongs human smuggling. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and costly, and building a wall is pointless. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and those who don't often overstay their visas in search of freedom and opportunity. Immigrants have always been and will continue to be a vital part of what makes America great. END OF SUMMARY.
