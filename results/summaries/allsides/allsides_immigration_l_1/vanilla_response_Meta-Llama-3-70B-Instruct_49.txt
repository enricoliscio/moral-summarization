SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants have been the driving force behind America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have introduced specialized skills, founded profitable companies, and created millions of jobs. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. Immigrant-founded businesses sell $857 billion in goods annually and employ almost 4 million workers. Critics' claims that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs and commit crimes are debunked by studies showing that they contribute more to Medicare than they receive and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The article concludes that the current U.S. citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to unintended social consequences. Instead of building walls and rounding up undocumented immigrants, the nation should welcome and integrate them, as they are essential to America's past and future greatness.
