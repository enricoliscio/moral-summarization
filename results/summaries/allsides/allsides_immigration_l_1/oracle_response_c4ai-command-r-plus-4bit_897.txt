SUMMARY: Immigrants have long been the backbone of America's greatness, with their contributions helping to build and sustain the nation. Contrary to the negative rhetoric of politicians like Donald Trump, immigrants bring specialized skills, entrepreneurship, and a strong work ethic, as evidenced by the many successful companies founded by immigrants or their offspring. Despite critics' claims, undocumented immigrants do not abuse social programs like Medicare; in fact, they pay more into the system than they receive. Similarly, studies show that native-born citizens are far more likely to commit crimes than immigrants, refuting the correlation between immigration and wrongdoing. The true danger lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful behavior and puts public safety and health at risk. Calls for increased government spending on projects like a border wall are irresponsible, especially when considering that most immigrants reside in the US lawfully or overstay their visas. Immigrants come to America in search of freedom and opportunity, values that should be welcomed and celebrated by native-born citizens and lawmakers alike. END OF SUMMARY.
