SUMMARY: Contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric, immigrants have sustained America's greatness and helped build its success. They introduce specialized skills and have founded many profitable companies, contributing to millions of jobs and services. Studies show that undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive and are less likely to end up incarcerated than native-born residents. Critics ignore these facts and argue that immigrants abuse social programs and correlate immigration with crime, which is unfounded. The true danger lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives and prolongs human smuggling. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and calls for increased government spending are irresponsible. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and those who don't often overstay their visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants instead of disparaging them. Immigrants are what made and will continue to make America great. END OF SUMMARY.
