SUMMARY: Immigrants are the cornerstone of America's greatness, despite Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. They have not only built but also sustained the nation. Immigrants bring specialized skills and have founded some of America's most successful companies, with roughly 40% of Fortune 500 businesses tracing their roots to immigrants. These businesses have generated millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded companies selling $857 billion in annual goods and employing nearly 4 million workers. Critics ignore these contributions and instead falsely claim that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs like Medicare. Studies show that undocumented immigrants actually contribute more to Medicare than they receive. Similarly, critics associate immigration with crime, but statistics prove that native-born males are far more likely to be incarcerated than their foreign-born counterparts. The real danger lies in the unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives and prolongs human smuggling. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and calls for increased government spending are irresponsible. Most immigrants reside in the US lawfully, and many of those who don't have simply overstayed their visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. Immigrants should be welcomed, not disparaged, as they are the key to America's past and future greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
