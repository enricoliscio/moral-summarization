Okay, so I need to summarize this article about immigrants and their role in America's success. The article starts by talking about how immigrants are the common denominator in America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. It mentions that without immigrants, America wouldn't exist as it does today. They helped build and sustain the country, which Reagan called a "shining city upon a hill." 

The article gives examples of companies like Budweiser and McDonald's being founded by immigrants or their children. It also cites a report that 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant roots. Immigrants contribute $857 billion annually and employ 4 million people. 

Critics argue about undocumented immigrants abusing social programs, but a study shows they pay more into Medicare than they receive. Native-born residents actually take more from Medicare. The article also mentions that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated than immigrants. 

The problem isn't immigrants but the complex citizenship process, which leads to underground economies and smuggling. The article opposes rounding up undocumented immigrants and building walls, suggesting it's impractical and expensive. It emphasizes that immigrants come for freedom and opportunity, and they should be welcomed to continue making America great.

So, the summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words. I should include the positive contributions of immigrants, the companies they've started, the economic impact, the refutation of critics' arguments, the issues with the citizenship process, and the conclusion that immigrants are essential for America's future greatness.
