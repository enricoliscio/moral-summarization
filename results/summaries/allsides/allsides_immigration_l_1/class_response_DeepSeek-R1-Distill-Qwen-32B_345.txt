Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided the article and the list of morally framed words. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral arguments presented.

The article talks about how immigrants are crucial to America's success, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. It mentions that immigrants built and sustained the country, contributing skills and founding major companies. It also addresses critics who argue about immigrants abusing social programs, but provides studies showing they contribute more to Medicare than they take. The article also challenges the link between immigration and crime, citing a study that shows native-born individuals are more likely to be incarcerated. 

The moral framing here includes words like "sustained," "ignore," "abuse," "study," "wrongdoing," "unnecessarily," "bureaucratic," "convoluted," "underground," "smuggling," "encouraged," "prolonged," "subsidized—government," "overstayed," "freedom," "hardship," and "disparage." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by highlighting the positive contributions of immigrants, using "sustained" and mentioning the companies they founded. Then, address the critics who "ignore" these contributions, using "abuse" in the context of social programs. I'll include the study results to counter the critics. Next, discuss the crime statistics, using "wrongdoing" and the study findings. Then, talk about the bureaucratic issues with the citizenship process, using "unnecessarily," "bureaucratic," and "convoluted." Mention the negative consequences like "underground" economies and "smuggling," which are "encouraged" and "prolonged." Also, touch on the "subsidized—government" projects like the wall. Finally, emphasize that immigrants come for "freedom" and "hardship," and the call to not "disparage" them.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key points and the moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral word is appropriately placed without making it sound forced.

Wait, I should also make sure the summary flows naturally and doesn't just list points. It should present a coherent argument that immigrants are beneficial and that current policies are problematic, using the moral language to highlight the issues.

I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate all the necessary moral terms and keep it within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article emphasizes that immigrants are central to America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have "sustained" the nation, contributing specialized skills and founding major companies like Budweiser and McDonald’s. Despite critics who "ignore" these contributions, studies show immigrants "abuse" social programs less, with undocumented immigrants paying $13.8 billion more into Medicare than they receive. Contrary to claims linking immigration to "wrongdoing," a study found native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated. The U.S. citizenship process is "unnecessarily" "bureaucratic" and "convoluted," leading to "underground" economies and "smuggling." Building a wall is a "subsidized—government" project, while most undocumented immigrants "overstayed" visas. Immigrants seek "freedom" and "hardship" relief, and native-born citizens should not "disparage" them. Immigrants are key to America's past and future greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
