Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how immigrants have contributed to America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. The author mentions that immigrants built and sustained the country, citing examples like Budweiser and McDonald's founded by immigrants or their offspring. They also reference a report that 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant roots, contributing millions of jobs and billions in sales.

The article then addresses critics who argue about undocumented immigrants abusing social programs. It counters this with a study showing undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. It also mentions that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born, challenging the correlation between immigration and crime.

The author criticizes the current citizenship process as bureaucratic, which leads to delays and encourages unlawful alternatives, like human smuggling. They compare this to prohibition's impact, suggesting it increases public safety risks. The conclusion is that rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and building a wall is a wasteful project. Instead, immigrants should be welcomed as they are the key to America's future greatness.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary using the moral words provided. I'll start by highlighting the contribution of immigrants, countering Trump's rhetoric, and include terms like "sustained," "abuse," "wrongdoing," "bureaucratic," "unlawful," "smuggling," "welcome," and "disparage." I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the economic contributions, the refutation of critics, the flaws in the citizenship process, and the call for welcoming immigrants.

I'll make sure each sentence includes a moral term where appropriate without forcing it. The summary should be clear and within the word limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article counters Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric by emphasizing immigrants’ pivotal role in America’s success. Immigrants have sustained the nation, founding or contributing to 40% of Fortune 500 companies, creating millions of jobs, and generating billions in revenue. Critics often abuse the narrative by correlating immigration with crime or Medicare abuse, but studies show undocumented immigrants pay more into Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born individuals. The current citizenship process, however, is bureaucratic and convoluted, incentivizing unlawful alternatives like human smuggling, which prolongs public safety risks. Building a wall or rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and irresponsible, as most immigrants seek freedom and opportunity. Native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants, not disparage them, as they are the key to America’s future greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
