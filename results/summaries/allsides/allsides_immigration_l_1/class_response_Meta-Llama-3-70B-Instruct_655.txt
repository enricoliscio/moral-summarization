SUMMARY:

The author argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have introduced specialized skills, founded profitable companies, and created millions of jobs. Critics often ignore these contributions and instead accuse undocumented immigrants of abusing social programs, but studies show that they actually pay more into Medicare than they receive. The correlation between crime and immigration is also debunked, as native-born males are more likely to end up incarcerated. The current U.S. citizenship process is unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted, incentivizing unlawful alternatives. The author warns that rounding up undocumented immigrants and building a wall would be impractical and irresponsible, and instead, native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome immigrants who come to the U.S. seeking freedom and opportunity. Immigrants have sustained America's greatness in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
