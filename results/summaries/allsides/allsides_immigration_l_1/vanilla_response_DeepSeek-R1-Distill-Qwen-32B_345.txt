Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about immigrants and their role in America's success. It starts by countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance, saying immigrants are essential. 

Okay, the main points are: immigrants built and sustain America, they contribute skills, start businesses. Examples given are Budweiser and McDonald's founded by immigrants or their children. Also, 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant roots. They generate a lot of jobs and revenue.

Critics argue undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but the article says they actually contribute more to Medicare than they take. Native-born have a bigger deficit. Also, crime rates are lower among immigrants than native-born.

The article also criticizes the citizenship process as too bureaucratic, leading to problems like underground economies and human smuggling. It suggests that rounding up undocumented immigrants isn't practical and building a wall is a waste of money. Immigrants come for freedom and opportunity, so they should be welcomed.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll mention the positive contributions, counter the critics' arguments with the study data, touch on the flawed immigration system, and conclude with the importance of immigrants for America's future.

Let me structure it: start with immigrants' role, their contributions to economy, counter the critics, mention the bureaucracy issue, and the conclusion about welcoming immigrants.

SUMMARY: The article highlights immigrants' pivotal role in America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric by emphasizing their contributions to building and sustaining the nation. Immigrants bring specialized skills, founding many prominent companies, including Budweiser and McDonald's, and 40% of Fortune 500 businesses trace their origins to immigrants. These ventures generate millions of jobs and billions in revenue. Critics argue undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, but studies show they contribute more to Medicare than they use, unlike native-born residents who create a deficit. Immigrants are also less likely to commit crimes than native-born individuals. The article criticizes the cumbersome U.S. citizenship process, which can lead to illegal alternatives and public safety risks. Building a wall is deemed ineffective, as most undocumented immigrants overstayed visas. Immigrants seek freedom and opportunity, and welcoming them is key to America's continued greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
