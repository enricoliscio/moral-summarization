SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses have immigrant roots, producing millions of jobs and services. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs are misinformed, as they actually contribute to Medicare's surplus. Moreover, native-born citizens are more likely to commit crimes than foreign-born individuals. The article concludes that the current citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, encouraging unlawful alternatives and public safety risks. Instead of building walls and deporting immigrants, the US should welcome them, as they come seeking freedom and opportunity, and are essential to making America great again.
