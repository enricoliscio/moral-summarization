SUMMARY: Immigrants have always been instrumental in building and sustaining America's greatness, contrary to the negative rhetoric often directed at them. They bring with them specialized skills and an entrepreneurial spirit, founding and contributing to some of the country's most successful companies. Despite criticism about their alleged strain on social programs and correlation with crime, studies show that immigrants, including undocumented ones, contribute more to Medicare than they receive and have lower incarceration rates than native-born citizens. The true danger lies in a bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process that pushes people towards unlawful alternatives. A sensible approach to immigration recognizes the value immigrants bring and welcomes them, not disparages them. Immigrants are the key to America's past and future greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
