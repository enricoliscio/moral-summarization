Okay, so I'm trying to summarize this article, but I need to make sure I preserve the moral framing the author used. The user has given me a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral stance.

The article starts by stating that immigrants are the common denominator of America's greatness, countering Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It mentions that immigrants built and sustained America, using Reagan's "shining city upon a hill" metaphor. Then it talks about how immigrants bring specialized skills and contribute to successful companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. It also cites a report that 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their descendants, providing jobs and services.

The article then addresses critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs like Medicare. However, it counters this with a study showing that undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. It also mentions that native-born males are more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born, challenging the link between immigration and crime.

The author criticizes the U.S. citizenship process as unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to delays and encouraging unlawful alternatives like human smuggling. They compare this to the prohibition era's rise of organized crime, suggesting that prolonging the status quo increases public safety risks. The article opposes rounding up undocumented immigrants and building walls, calling such measures impractical and fiscally irresponsible, especially with the country's debt.

Finally, the article emphasizes that most immigrants come for freedom and opportunity, fleeing hardship, and urges welcoming them instead of disparaging. It concludes that immigrants are what made America great and will continue to do so.

Now, I need to create a summary that includes as many of the morally framed words as possible: sustained, ignore, abuse, study, wrongdoing, unnecessarily, bureaucratic, convoluted, underground, smuggling, encouraged, prolonged, subsidizedâ€”government, overstayed, freedom, hardship, disparage.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the positive contributions of immigrants, the refutation of critics using studies, the flaws in the citizenship process, and the moral call to welcome immigrants.

I should ensure that each point is concise and includes the moral terms. Let me draft it step by step, making sure not to exceed 200 words.
