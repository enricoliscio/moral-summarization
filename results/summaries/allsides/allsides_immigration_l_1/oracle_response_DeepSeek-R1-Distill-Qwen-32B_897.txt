Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read the article carefully to understand its main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about how immigrants are essential to America's success, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. It mentions that immigrants have built and sustained the country, contributing to businesses and the economy. It also addresses critics who argue against immigrants, providing data on how undocumented immigrants actually contribute more to Medicare than they take, and how native-borns have higher crime rates.

I need to make sure to include the morally framed words like rhetoric, sustained, abuse, pay, correlate, wrongdoing, danger, bureaucratic, incentivizing, unlawful, crime, risks, increase, smuggling, encouraged, prolonged, irresponsible, drowning, welcome, disparage, etc.

I should structure the summary to highlight the positive contributions of immigrants, counter the negative arguments, and emphasize the moral issues with restrictive policies. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well while including as many of the specified moral terms as possible.

Let me start by outlining the key points: immigrants' contributions, economic impact, critique of anti-immigrant rhetoric, data on Medicare and crime, problems with the citizenship process, and the moral call to welcome immigrants.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to incorporate the moral language and maintain the original's tone and message.

SUMMARY: The article challenges Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, emphasizing that immigrants are central to America’s success. Immigrants have built and sustained the nation, founding many of its leading companies and creating millions of jobs. Despite critics claiming undocumented immigrants abuse social programs, studies show they contribute more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Additionally, native-born males are more likely to commit crimes than foreign-born individuals. The U.S. citizenship process, however, remains overly bureaucratic, incentivizing unlawful alternatives and prolonging public safety risks. Building a wall or rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical and irresponsible, as most immigrants seek freedom and opportunity. The author argues that welcoming immigrants, rather than disparaging them, is key to maintaining America’s greatness. END OF SUMMARY.
