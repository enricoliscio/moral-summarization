Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long—max 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about how immigrants have been crucial to America's success, countering Trump's anti-immigrant stance. The author mentions immigrants building and sustaining the country, founding major companies, contributing to the economy, and how critics ignore these positive aspects. There are studies showing immigrants contribute more to Medicare and have lower crime rates. The article also criticizes the bureaucratic citizenship process, leading to underground activities and smuggling.

I need to highlight the positive contributions of immigrants using words like "sustained," "ignore," "abuse," "wrongdoing," "unnecessarily," "bureaucratic," "convoluted," "smuggling," "freedom," "hardship," and "disparage." I should structure the summary to first talk about the positive impact, then address the critics and their arguments, and finally discuss the issues with the current immigration system.

I'll start by stating that immigrants are key to America's greatness, countering Trump. Then mention the businesses they've founded, the economic contributions, and the studies supporting their positive impact. Next, address the critics who ignore these facts and instead make unfounded claims about abuse and crime. Then, discuss the flaws in the immigration system, like the bureaucratic process leading to smuggling and underground economies. Conclude by emphasizing welcoming immigrants and their role in making America great.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll make sure each point is brief but covers all necessary moral words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence includes the key moral terms without overcrowding.

SUMMARY: The author argues that immigrants are central to America's success, countering anti-immigrant rhetoric by highlighting their role in building and sustaining the nation. Immigrants contribute specialized skills, founding major companies like Budweiser and McDonald’s, and 40% of Fortune 500 businesses trace their origins to immigrants. Immigrant-founded businesses generate $857 billion in goods and employ nearly 4 million workers. Critics often ignore these contributions, instead accusing undocumented immigrants of abusing social programs like Medicare. However, studies show undocumented immigrants contribute more to Medicare than they receive, while native-born residents create a deficit. Additionally, native-born males are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born individuals. The author criticizes the unnecessarily bureaucratic and convoluted U.S. citizenship process, which discourages lawful immigration and encourages underground economies and smuggling. Rounding up undocumented immigrants is impractical, and building a wall is a taxpayer-subsidized waste. Most undocumented immigrants overstayed visas, seeking freedom and opportunity. Native-born citizens should welcome immigrants, as they are key to America's past greatness and future potential. END OF SUMMARY.
