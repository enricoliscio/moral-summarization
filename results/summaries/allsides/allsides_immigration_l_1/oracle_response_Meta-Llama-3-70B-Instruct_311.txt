SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have not only built but also sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses produce millions of jobs and services, with immigrant-founded businesses selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs like Medicare ignore the fact that they pay $13.8 billion more into the system than they receive. The article also debunks the correlation between crime and immigration, citing a study that found native-born males are 10 times more likely to end up incarcerated than their foreign-born counterparts. The true danger lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which incentivizes unlawful alternatives and increases public safety and health risks. The article concludes that immigrants are what made America great in the past and will make it great again in the future, and native-born citizens and lawmakers should welcome them, not disparage them.
