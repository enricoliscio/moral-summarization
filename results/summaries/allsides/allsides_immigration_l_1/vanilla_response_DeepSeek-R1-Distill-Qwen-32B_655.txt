Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about how immigrants have contributed to America's success and why anti-immigrant policies are counterproductive. It starts by countering Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance, pointing out that immigrants have built and sustained America. It mentions companies like Budweiser and McDonald's, which were founded by immigrants or their children. The article also cites a report that 40% of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant ties, contributing millions of jobs and billions in sales. 

It then addresses critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs. The article counters this by stating that undocumented immigrants actually contribute more to Medicare than they take out, unlike native-born residents. It also mentions that native-born males are more likely to commit crimes than immigrants. 

The article criticizes the U.S. citizenship process as too bureaucratic, leading to delays and encouraging illegal activities. It warns that harsh enforcement could increase public safety risks and create underground economies, similar to the Prohibition era. The author argues against rounding up undocumented immigrants and building walls, calling these measures impractical and costly. Instead, they suggest welcoming immigrants, as they are essential for America's greatness now and in the future.

So, the key points are: immigrants' contributions to the economy, dispelling myths about their impact on social programs and crime, criticizing the current immigration system, and advocating for a more welcoming approach. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to cover these main points clearly.
