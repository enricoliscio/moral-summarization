SUMMARY:
Immigrants are the backbone of America's "greatness," contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. They have not only built but sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding celebrated companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses can trace their beginnings to immigrants. These businesses produce millions of jobs and services, selling $857 billion in goods annually and employing almost 4 million workers. Critics who argue that undocumented immigrants abuse social programs or increase crime are misinformed. In reality, they pay a $13.8 billion surplus into Medicare and are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens. The true "danger" lies in the bureaucratic and convoluted citizenship process, which encourages unlawful alternatives. Rather than building walls, we should welcome immigrants who come to the US for "freedom" and "opportunity." They are what made America "great" in the past and will do so in the future.
