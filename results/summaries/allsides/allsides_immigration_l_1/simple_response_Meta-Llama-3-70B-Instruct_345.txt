SUMMARY:

The article argues that immigrants are the backbone of America's greatness, contrary to anti-immigrant rhetoric. Immigrants have built and sustained the country, introducing specialized skills and founding profitable companies like Budweiser and McDonald's. In fact, 40% of Fortune 500 businesses have immigrant roots, generating millions of jobs and services. Critics who claim undocumented immigrants abuse social programs are misinformed, as they actually contribute more to Medicare than they receive. Moreover, native-born citizens are more likely to commit crimes than foreign-born individuals. The current citizenship process is bureaucratic and convoluted, leading to unintended social consequences. Rather than rounding up undocumented immigrants or building a wall, the US should welcome immigrants who come seeking freedom and opportunity. They are what made America great in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

END OF SUMMARY.
