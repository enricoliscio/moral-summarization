SUMMARY:

House Republicans are lying about their new immigration bill, claiming it would prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, the bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in parents being sent into criminal custody without their children. Instead, the bill gets rid of legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain them indefinitely. This means that if families are kept together, their parents must be released with them, but the bill does not require ICE to keep parents and children together in detention. The Trump administration has been using family separation as a way to maximize detention of asylum seekers, and this bill would allow them to continue doing so. The bill's language is misleading, and its provisions would lead to children being held in facilities that are essentially jails with their parents for months or even years. END OF SUMMARY.
