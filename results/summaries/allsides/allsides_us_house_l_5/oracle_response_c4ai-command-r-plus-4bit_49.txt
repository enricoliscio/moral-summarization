SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, set to reach the House floor next week, is being misleadingly framed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and others as a solution to the immoral family separation crisis at the US-Mexico border. They claim that the bill will prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents, but this is a lie. The bill does not outlaw family separation; instead, it eliminates legal protections for children, allowing them to be detained indefinitely alongside their parents. It gives the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to detain immigrant children in the same way as adults, overruling the Flores agreement, which mandates that children be held in the "least restrictive" conditions and released without delay. The bill does not address the root causes of family separation and, in fact, enables the administration to continue its practice of keeping families in detention indefinitely. The only way the bill could end family separation is if the administration chooses to stop prosecuting parents and makes an effort to keep families together in detention, but this would still result in children being held in jail-like facilities for extended periods. The Republican bill is a cynical attempt to justify inhumane practices and must be recognized as such.

END OF SUMMARY.
