SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives introduced a "compromise" immigration bill that covers border security, DACA recipients' path to legal status, and cuts to legal family-based immigration. Despite claims, the bill does not outlaw family separation at the US-Mexico border. Instead, it eliminates legal protections for children in immigration detention, allowing indefinite detention for kids and families. The bill removes the requirement for the least restrictive conditions for children and does not address the mechanism used to separate families. The Trump administration could still separate families or choose to keep them together in detention indefinitely. The bill's provision on family detention overrules the Flores agreement, which limits child detention. The administration's priority is to maximize detention of asylum seekers, including parents, leading to family separation. The bill enables indefinite detention for families, with no requirements for additional conditions for children. The bill's potential to end family separation relies on the administration's decision to stop prosecuting parents and keep families together in detention.

END OF SUMMARY.
