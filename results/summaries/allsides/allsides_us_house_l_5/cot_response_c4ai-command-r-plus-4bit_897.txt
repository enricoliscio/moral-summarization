SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives have released a "compromise" immigration bill that is being misleadingly promoted as a solution to the immoral family separation crisis at the US-Mexico border. The bill does not outlaw family separation and instead targets legal protections for children and families in immigration detention. It removes requirements for children to be kept in the least restrictive conditions and to be released without unnecessary delay, which could result in indefinite detention for children and parents. The bill's provisions allow the Trump administration to continue its "catch and release" policy, prioritizing the detention of asylum seekers, including parents. The administration's current practice of separating families to detain parents while sending children to sponsors would be enabled by this bill. It gives the Department of Homeland Security discretion to indefinitely detain children and families without specifying conditions, potentially placing children in adult detention centers. The bill fails to address the mechanism used to separate families and provides no guarantee that parents and children will be kept together in detention. The only potential outcome that could end family separation is if the administration chooses to stop prosecuting parents and makes an effort to keep families together in detention, which is not assured. This bill is a disturbing attempt to justify and continue inhumane practices that inflict suffering on vulnerable families and children. 

END OF SUMMARY.
