Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a Republican immigration bill that's supposed to prevent family separation but actually doesn't. The author uses strong moral terms like "lying," "separation," and "detention." 

I should highlight that the bill doesn't outlaw family separation as claimed. It removes protections that prevent indefinite detention of children. The Flores agreement is being overturned, which previously limited how long kids could be detained. The bill allows the government to keep families in detention indefinitely, which is a big issue.

I need to include the key moral words like "lying," "separation," "detention," and "indefinitely." Also, mention how the bill changes the Flores agreement and the potential for indefinite detention. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the author's critical stance.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill claims to end family separation but does not outlaw it. It removes legal protections under the Flores agreement, which required children to be detained in the "least restrictive" conditions and released without unnecessary delay. Instead, the bill allows indefinite detention of children and families in ICE facilities. It does not prevent the Trump administration from separating families or prosecuting parents for illegal entry. The bill's language, which Republicans falsely claim ends family separation, actually gives the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to detain children with their parents, potentially indefinitely. This would allow the administration to keep families in detention for months or years, effectively continuing its harsh immigration enforcement policies under a different guise. The bill does not address the mechanism used to separate families or require ICE to keep them together. In essence, it enables indefinite detention of families, undermining the Flores agreement and failing to protect children from prolonged detention. END OF SUMMARY.
