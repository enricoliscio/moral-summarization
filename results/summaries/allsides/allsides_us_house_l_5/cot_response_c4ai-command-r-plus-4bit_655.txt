SUMMARY: 
Republicans in the House of Representatives have released a "compromise" immigration bill that includes funding for Trump's border wall and a path to legal status for DACA recipients. However, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others are misleading the public by claiming that the bill will prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the border. In reality, the bill does not outlaw family separation and instead removes legal protections for children in immigration detention. The bill gives the administration the power to detain children and families indefinitely in ICE detention centers, which is what Trump has wanted all along. The bill does not address the mechanism the administration has been using to separate families and does not require ICE to keep parents and children together in detention. The only reason family separation could possibly end is if the administration chooses to keep families together in detention, resulting in children being held in jail-like facilities with their parents for extended periods. The Republican bill prioritizes border security and cuts to legal family-based immigration over the well-being and unity of immigrant families, demonstrating a lack of moral concern for the vulnerable.
