SUMMARY:
The House Republicans' new immigration bill is being misleadingly touted as a solution to the Trump administration's practice of separating children from their parents at the border. However, the bill does not outlaw family separation, but rather allows the administration to detain children and parents indefinitely. The bill gets rid of legal protections that prevent the prolonged detention of children and families, which the administration has blamed for "forcing" them to separate families. In reality, the bill would enable the administration to keep families in ICE detention centers for months or even years, essentially turning them into jails. The bill's proponents are lying about its effects, and it would actually perpetuate the widespread practice of family separation. END OF SUMMARY.
