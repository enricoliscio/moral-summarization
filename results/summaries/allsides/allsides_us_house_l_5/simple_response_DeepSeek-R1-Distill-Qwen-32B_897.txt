Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Republican immigration bill. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a compromise immigration bill proposed by House Republicans. It includes funding for the border wall, a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients, and changes to family-based immigration. But the key focus is on family separation. The Republicans claim the bill ends family separation, but the author argues they're lying.

The bill doesn't outlaw family separation. Instead, it removes legal protections that prevent indefinite detention of children and families. The Flores agreement currently limits how long kids can be detained, but the bill would overturn that, allowing ICE to detain families indefinitely. The author is critical, saying the bill doesn't stop separations but instead allows for indefinite detention, which is what Trump wanted.

I need to make sure the summary captures that the Republicans are misleadingly claiming the bill stops family separation, while in reality, it just changes the method of detention without stopping separations. The moral angle is that the bill doesn't protect families but instead continues harmful practices under a different guise.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the bill's provisions, the Flores agreement, the removal of protections, and the critique that it doesn't stop family separation but allows indefinite detention. Also, mention that the Republican summary is deceptive.

Let me structure this: start with the bill's introduction, mention the claims vs reality, explain the removal of Flores protections, and conclude with the moral critique that it doesn't end separation but allows indefinite detention, which is harmful.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Make sure the summary flows logically and highlights the deception and the continuation of problematic policies.

SUMMARY:  
The Republican immigration bill, presented as a "compromise," claims to end family separation at the border. However, it does not outlaw the practice or prevent the Trump administration from separating families. Instead, it removes legal protections that require children and families to be held in the "least restrictive" conditions and for limited durations. The bill overturns the Flores agreement, which has restricted indefinite detention of children for 20 years. This change would allow the government to detain families indefinitely, including children, in ICE facilities. While the bill's summary falsely claims to end family separation, its actual effect is to permit indefinite detention, effectively continuing the administration's harmful policies under a different guise. The bill does not address the prosecution of parents or require families to remain together, leaving the door open for continued separation or prolonged detention. The author accuses Republicans of misleadingly framing the bill as a solution to family separation while enabling indefinite detention, which aligns with Trump's goal of maximizing detention to prevent unauthorized immigration. END OF SUMMARY.
