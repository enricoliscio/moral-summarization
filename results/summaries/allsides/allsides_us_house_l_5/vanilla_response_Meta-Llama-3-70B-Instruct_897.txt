SUMMARY:

The House Republicans' new immigration bill claims to end family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it actually allows for indefinite detention of children and families by ICE. The bill removes legal protections that require children to be kept in "least restrictive" conditions and not be detained longer than necessary. Instead, it allows ICE to detain families together indefinitely, which is what the Trump administration has wanted all along. The bill does not outlaw family separation, and the administration can still prosecute asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in family separation. The bill's provision on family detention overrules a 20-year-old court agreement that limits the detention of children. In reality, the bill could lead to children being held in facilities that are essentially jails with their parents for months or years until their cases are resolved.

END OF SUMMARY.
