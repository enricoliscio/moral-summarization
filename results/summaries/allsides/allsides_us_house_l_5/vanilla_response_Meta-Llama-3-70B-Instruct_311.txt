SUMMARY:

The new Republican immigration bill in the House of Representatives claims to end family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it actually allows for the indefinite detention of children and families by ICE. The bill gets rid of legal protections that require children to be kept in the "least restrictive" conditions possible and not be detained longer than necessary. Instead, it would allow the Trump administration to keep families in detention until their cases are resolved, potentially for months or years. The bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, which results in family separation. The bill's provision on family detention would overrule a 20-year-old court agreement that limits the detention of children. In reality, the bill would allow the Trump administration to detain families indefinitely, rather than ending family separation.

END OF SUMMARY.
