SUMMARY:

House Republicans are lying about their new immigration bill, claiming it would prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, the bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in parents being sent into criminal custody without their children. Instead, the bill gets rid of the extra legal protections that children and families have in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain immigrant children and families indefinitely. This means that if families are kept together, their parents must be released with them, but the administration can still detain them for months or even years. The bill allows the Trump administration to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, and does not specify any additional conditions on how children can be detained. In reality, the bill would enable the administration to detain children and parents together in facilities that are essentially jails, forcing them to stay there until their cases are resolved.
