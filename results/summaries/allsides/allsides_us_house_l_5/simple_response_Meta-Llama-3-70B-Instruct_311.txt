SUMMARY:

The House Republicans' "compromise" immigration bill claims to end family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it's a lie. In reality, the bill allows the Trump administration to detain immigrant children and families indefinitely, without any additional conditions or protections. It gets rid of the Flores agreement, which limits the detention of children to 20 days and requires them to be kept in the "least restrictive" conditions possible. Instead, the bill would enable the administration to keep families in ICE detention centers, potentially for months or even years, until their cases are resolved. This is a morally reprehensible approach that prioritizes detention and deportation over the well-being and dignity of families seeking asylum. The bill does not address the mechanism used to separate families, and it does not require ICE to keep parents and children together in detention. It's a cruel and inhumane proposal that perpetuates the suffering of vulnerable families.

END OF SUMMARY.
