Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Republican bill is supposed to end family separation, but it doesn't. Instead, it removes protections that prevent indefinite detention of families. The Flores agreement is being overturned, which allowed for limited detention periods. The bill allows ICE to detain families indefinitely, which the administration wants to do instead of separating them. The summary should highlight the deceit in claiming the bill ends separation and the potential for indefinite detention.

I need to make sure to include words like "lying," "separate," "detained," "released," "detention," etc. I'll structure the summary to first state that the bill doesn't end separation, then explain how it removes protections and allows indefinite detention, and finally mention the Flores agreement being overturned.

I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and maintains the moral critique from the original article.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill claims to end family separation at the border but does not outlaw it. Instead, it removes legal protections that prevent the indefinite detention of children and families. The Flores agreement, which limits detention periods and requires "least restrictive" conditions for children, would be overturned. The bill allows ICE to detain families indefinitely, without requiring them to stay together. While it may reduce separations, families could still be held in detention for months or years. The bill does not address the administration's practice of prosecuting parents, which has led to separations. The claim that the bill ends family separation is misleading, as it does not force the government to keep families together or prevent indefinite detention. END OF SUMMARY.
