Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about a Republican immigration bill that's supposed to end family separations at the border, but the author argues it's deceptive. Let me break it down.

First, the bill claims to prevent family separation, but the author says it doesn't. It doesn't stop prosecuting asylum seekers, which leads to separations. Instead, it removes legal protections that require kids to be in the least restrictive conditions. So, the government can now detain families together indefinitely. 

The Flores agreement is mentioned as a 20-year-old court ruling that limits how long kids can be detained. The bill overturns that, allowing indefinite detention. The author is critical, saying the bill doesn't end family separation but allows indefinite detention, which is what Trump wanted all along.

I need to capture the moral issue here: the bill is deceptive because it doesn't stop separations but changes the rules to allow indefinite detention. The author is highlighting the hypocrisy and the negative impact on families.

I should structure the summary to first state the Republican claim, then explain what the bill actually does, and conclude with the author's criticism about the deceptive nature and the moral implications.

SUMMARY:  
The Republican immigration bill, presented as a compromise to end family separations at the border, is misleading. While it claims to prevent the Trump administration from separating children from parents, the bill does not outlaw family separation or stop prosecutions for illegal entry, which often lead to separations. Instead, it removes legal protections requiring children to be held in the "least restrictive" conditions and not detained longer than necessary. This allows the government to indefinitely detain families together in ICE custody, effectively replacing separations with indefinite detention. The bill overturns the Flores agreement, a 20-year-old court ruling that limited child detention, and does not require ICE to keep families together. Critics argue the bill is deceptive, as it enables the Trump administration to continue detaining families indefinitely, which aligns with its goal of maximizing detention to prevent unauthorized immigration. The moral framing highlights the bill's failure to address family separation while allowing harsher detention practices.  
END OF SUMMARY.
