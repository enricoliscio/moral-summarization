SUMMARY:
The House Republicans' new immigration bill is being misleadingly touted as a solution to the Trump administration's cruel practice of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. In reality, the bill does not outlaw family separation, but instead allows the administration to detain children and parents indefinitely in ICE facilities, essentially turning them into jails. The bill gets rid of the "least restrictive" conditions for detaining children and allows the administration to prosecute asylum seekers, leading to parents being separated from their children. The Trump administration has been blaming "loopholes" in the current system for "forcing" them to separate families, but this bill would actually enable them to detain families indefinitely. The bill's claim to end family separation is a lie, and its true intention is to allow the administration to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, in a cruel and inhumane manner. END OF SUMMARY.
