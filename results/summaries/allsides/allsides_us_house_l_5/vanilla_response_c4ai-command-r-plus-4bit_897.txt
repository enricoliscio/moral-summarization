SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives introduced a controversial immigration bill that addresses border security, protections for immigrants under DACA, and cuts to legal family-based immigration. The bill also claims to prevent the separation of children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, the bill does not explicitly outlaw family separation and does not stop the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in parents being separated from their children. Instead, the bill removes legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing for indefinite detention. The bill gives discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain immigrant children in the same manner as adults, overruling the Flores agreement, which limits the detention of children. The bill does not address the mechanism used by the Trump administration to separate families and does not require ICE to keep parents and children together in detention. The bill's potential to end family separation relies on the assumption that the administration will choose to keep families together in detention, resulting in prolonged detention for children.
END OF SUMMARY.
