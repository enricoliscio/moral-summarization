Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Republican immigration bill. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a compromise immigration bill proposed by House Republicans. It mentions several aspects like funding for the border wall, addressing DACA, and changes to family-based immigration. But the main focus seems to be on family separation at the border.

The bill claims to prevent family separation, but the author argues that it's misleading. The bill doesn't actually outlaw separating families. Instead, it removes legal protections that require children to be held in the least restrictive conditions and not detained longer than necessary. This means families could be detained together indefinitely.

The Flores agreement, which limits how long kids can be detained, is being overruled by the bill. Without it, the government can keep families in detention for much longer. The Trump administration has been separating families to avoid releasing them, and this bill would allow them to keep families detained without separating them, but it's still indefinite detention.

The Republican summary says it ends family separation, but the actual bill doesn't have that language. It just allows ICE to detain children with their parents without any time limits. So, the bill doesn't stop separations but changes how families are detained, possibly leading to indefinite detention together.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: the bill's claims vs reality, removal of Flores protections, potential for indefinite detention, and how it doesn't stop family separation but changes the detention conditions.

I'll structure it by first stating the bill's claims, then the reality, the impact on Flores, and the implications for family detention. Make sure to highlight that it doesn't end separation but allows indefinite detention together.

Let me check the word count as I go to stay within limits. Also, ensure the summary is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: A Republican immigration bill aims to address family separation at the border, but critics argue it does not stop the practice. Instead, it removes legal protections requiring children to be held in the least restrictive conditions and allows indefinite detention of families together. The bill overrules the Flores agreement, which limited detention periods for children. While the Republican summary claims to end family separation, the actual text permits ICE to detain children with their parents without time limits, effectively allowing indefinite detention. This aligns with the Trump administration's goal of maximizing detention of asylum seekers, potentially leading to prolonged family detention in ICE facilities. END OF SUMMARY.
