SUMMARY:
The House Republicans' "compromise" immigration bill is a sweeping plan that claims to prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, this is a lie. The bill doesn't outlaw family separation, and it doesn't stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US illegally. Instead, it gets rid of the extra legal protections that children and families have in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain kids and families indefinitely. This means that if families are kept together, parents must be released with them. The Trump administration has been blaming these protections for "forcing" them to separate families. If the bill passes, the administration will likely stop separating families, but instead, it will be able to keep children and parents in ICE detention until their cases are resolved, which could take months or even years. This is a morally reprehensible outcome.
END OF SUMMARY.
