SUMMARY: 
Republicans in the House of Representatives introduced a "compromise" immigration bill that fails to address the immoral practice of family separation at the US-Mexico border. Despite claims to the contrary, the bill does not outlaw family separation or force the Trump administration to keep families together. Instead, it eliminates legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing them to be *detained indefinitely* in conditions akin to *jails*. The bill gives the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to decide whether to detain immigrant children, overruling the Flores agreement that has protected children from indefinite detention for 20 years. The Trump administration has chosen to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, and separating families to prevent their release into the US. The bill enables the administration to continue this immoral practice, keeping families in detention for months or years. It fails to address the mechanism used to separate families and does not require ICE to keep parents and children together. The bill's proponents are *lying* about its impact on family separation and are *blaming* the Flores agreement for *forcing* the administration to separate families. The bill would result in prolonged detention of children with their parents, an unacceptable solution that ignores the fundamental *immorality* of detaining families seeking asylum. 

END OF SUMMARY.
