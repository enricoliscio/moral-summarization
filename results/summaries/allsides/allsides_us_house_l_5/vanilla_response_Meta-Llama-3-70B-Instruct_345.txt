SUMMARY:

The House Republicans' new immigration bill claims to end family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it actually allows for indefinite detention of children and families by ICE. The bill removes legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, which would enable the Trump administration to keep them in detention until their cases are resolved. This means that instead of separating families, the administration could detain them together indefinitely. The bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry. The bill's provision allowing ICE to detain immigrant children in the same way as adults would overrule a 20-year-old court agreement that limits the detention of children. Overall, the bill would give the Trump administration more power to detain families and children, rather than ending family separation.

END OF SUMMARY.
