SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives have released a "compromise" immigration bill that fails to address the immoral practice of family separation at the US-Mexico border. Despite claims that the bill would prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents, it does nothing of the sort. Instead, it eliminates legal protections for children in immigration detention, allowing them to be detained indefinitely alongside their parents. The bill does not outlaw family separation or force the government to keep families together. In fact, it gives the Secretary of Homeland Security full discretion to detain immigrant children in the same way as adults, overruling a 20-year-old court agreement that limits the detention of children. The Trump administration has blamed "loopholes" for their family separation policy, but the bill merely enables them to detain families indefinitely, rather than separating them. The bill does not address the mechanism the administration uses to separate families and provides no requirements for keeping parents and children together in detention. The only possibility for ending family separation under this bill is if the administration chooses to stop prosecuting parents and makes an effort to detain families together. However, this would still result in children being held in jail-like facilities for extended periods. The bill fails to address the moral crisis of family separation and instead, prioritizes detention and restriction of immigration.

END OF SUMMARY.
