SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, set to reach the House floor next week, claims to prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, this is a lie. The bill does not outlaw family separation and does not stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between official border crossings, resulting in parents being detained without their children. The bill removes legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, giving the administration discretion to detain them indefinitely in the same way adults are detained. This overrules the Flores agreement, which requires that children be released without delay and kept in the least restrictive conditions. The administration has chosen to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, and separate families rather than release parents with their children. The bill enables indefinite detention of families, with no conditions on how children can be detained, and does not address the mechanism used to separate families. The only reason family separation could end is if the administration chooses to keep families together in detention, resulting in children being held in jail-like facilities with their parents for extended periods. This bill is a moral failure that enables the inhumane practice of family separation and indefinite detention.
END OF SUMMARY.
