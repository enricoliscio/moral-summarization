SUMMARY:

The new Republican immigration bill in the House of Representatives is being misleadingly touted as a solution to the Trump administration's practice of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. In reality, the bill does not outlaw family separation and would actually allow the administration to detain children and parents indefinitely in ICE detention centers. The bill eliminates legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, which the Trump administration has blamed for "forcing" them to separate families. Instead of releasing families together, the administration would be able to keep them detained together for months or even years. This is a morally reprehensible outcome that would perpetuate the suffering of vulnerable families seeking asylum. The bill's proponents are lying about its effects, and it is essential to see through their deception. 

END OF SUMMARY.
