SUMMARY:
The House Republicans' new immigration bill is being misleadingly touted as a solution to the Trump administration's practice of separating children from their parents at the border. However, the bill does not outlaw family separation, but rather allows the administration to detain children and parents indefinitely. The bill gets rid of legal protections that prevent the prolonged detention of children, which the Trump administration has blamed for "forcing" them to separate families. In reality, the bill enables the administration to keep families in immigration detention for months or even years, essentially turning detention centers into jails. The bill's proponents are lying about its effects, and it's a sweeping plan that covers border security, DACA, and legal immigration, but ultimately prioritizes the Trump administration's desire to maximize detention and control. END OF SUMMARY.
