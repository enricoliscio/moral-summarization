SUMMARY:

The Republican "compromise" immigration bill is a sweeping plan that covers border security, DACA, and legal family-based immigration. However, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others are lying about the bill's ability to prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. The bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in parents being sent into criminal custody without their children. Instead, the bill gets rid of legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain them indefinitely. This means that if families are kept together, their parents must be released with them. The Trump administration has been using family separation as a way to maximize detention of asylum seekers, and the House bill would allow them to continue this practice. The bill's language allows ICE to detain immigrant children in the same way as adults, with no limitations on the conditions of their detention. Ultimately, the bill would force children to be held in facilities that are essentially jails with their parents for months or years. END OF SUMMARY.
