SUMMARY: House Republicans have released a new immigration bill that includes $25 billion for Trump's border wall and a path to legal status for DACA recipients. Speaker Paul Ryan misleadingly claims that the bill will prevent the separation of children from their parents at the border. In reality, the bill removes legal protections for children in immigration detention, allowing the Trump administration to detain children and parents together indefinitely. The bill does not address the practice of referring parents for prosecution and separation from their children. The only way the bill could end family separation is if the administration chooses to stop prosecuting parents and keep families together in detention, which is unlikely given their focus on maximizing detention. The bill allows for the indefinite detention of children and families in jails-like facilities, which is inhumane and immoral. The bill's true aim is to enable the administration to continue its cruel and unnecessary practice of family separation and indefinite detention.

END OF SUMMARY.
