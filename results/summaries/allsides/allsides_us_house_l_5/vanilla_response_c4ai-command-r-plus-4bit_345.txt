SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives introduced a "compromise" immigration bill that covers border security, DACA protections, and cuts to legal family-based immigration. Despite claims, the bill does not outlaw family separation at the US-Mexico border. Instead, it eliminates legal protections for children in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain children and families indefinitely. The bill overrules the Flores agreement, which requires children to be released from detention without unnecessary delay and kept in the least restrictive conditions. The Trump administration has chosen to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, leading to family separations. The bill allows the administration to keep families in detention indefinitely without specifying additional conditions for children's detention. It also doesn't address the mechanism used to separate families, referring parents to DOJ custody for prosecution. The bill assumes the Trump administration will choose to keep families together in detention, but this could result in children being held in jail-like facilities with their parents for extended periods.

END OF SUMMARY.
