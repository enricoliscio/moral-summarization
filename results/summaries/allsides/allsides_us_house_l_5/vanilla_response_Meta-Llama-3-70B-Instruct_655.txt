SUMMARY:

The new Republican immigration bill in the House of Representatives claims to prevent family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it actually does the opposite. The bill allows for the indefinite detention of children and families by ICE, which would enable the Trump administration to keep families together in detention centers, rather than separating them. The bill repeals the Flores agreement, which limits the detention of children to 20 days, and allows ICE to detain children in the same way as adults. The bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry. Instead, it would allow the administration to detain families indefinitely, potentially for months or years, until their cases are resolved.

END OF SUMMARY.
