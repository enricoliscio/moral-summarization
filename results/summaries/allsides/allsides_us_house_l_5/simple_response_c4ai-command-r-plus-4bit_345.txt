SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives have released a controversial immigration bill that addresses border security, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and cuts to legal family-based immigration. The bill has been falsely portrayed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and others as a solution to the Trump administration's practice of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. In reality, the bill does not outlaw family separation and instead removes legal protections for children and families in immigration detention. It gives the Trump administration the power to indefinitely detain children and parents in ICE detention centers, which is what Trump has wanted all along. The bill removes the requirement to keep children in the least restrictive conditions and allows ICE to detain immigrant children in the same way as adults, overruling the Flores agreement that has protected children's rights for 20 years. The bill's proponents are lying about its impact on family separation and are instead enabling the indefinite detention of families in jail-like conditions. This is a moral outrage and a betrayal of the values of humanity and compassion that should guide immigration policy. 

END OF SUMMARY.
