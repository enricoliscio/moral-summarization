Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Republican immigration bill. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about a compromise bill released by House Republicans. It includes funding for the border wall, a path to legal status for DACA recipients, and changes to family-based immigration. But the focus is on family separation.

House Speaker Ryan claims the bill stops family separation, but the article says they're lying. The bill doesn't outlaw separation. It removes legal protections that prevent children from being detained indefinitely. The Flores agreement, which limits how long kids can be detained, would be overturned.

So, under the new bill, families could be detained together indefinitely. The bill allows ICE to keep kids and parents in detention without any time limits. It doesn't require them to stay together either, so separation could still happen.

The article also mentions that the bill doesn't address the prosecution of parents, which is how separations occur now. So even if families are detained together, they could be held for a long time, which isn't much better than separation.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points: the bill's contents, the false claims about stopping separation, the removal of Flores protections, allowing indefinite detention, and that separation isn't actually prevented.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all key aspects. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each main point is covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, set to be voted on in the House, includes funding for a border wall, a path to legal status for DACA recipients, and changes to family-based immigration. House Speaker Paul Ryan claims the bill stops family separation, but it doesn't outlaw the practice. Instead, it removes legal protections under the Flores agreement, which limits child detention. The bill allows ICE to detain families indefinitely, without requiring them to stay together, potentially leading to indefinite detention or continued separation. The Trump administration could still prosecute parents, leading to separation, as the bill doesn't address this mechanism. Thus, the bill doesn't end family separation but shifts to indefinite detention of families. END OF SUMMARY.
