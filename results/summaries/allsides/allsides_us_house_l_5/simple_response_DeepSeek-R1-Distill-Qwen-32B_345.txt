Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article discusses a Republican immigration bill in the House. It's supposed to prevent family separation but actually doesn't. The bill removes legal protections that require children to be held in the least restrictive conditions, allowing indefinite detention of families. The Flores agreement, which limits detention, is being overturned. The bill doesn't stop separations but changes how detention is handled, potentially leading to families being held together in detention indefinitely. The author criticizes this as a way for the Trump administration to keep families detained without actually stopping separations.

I need to capture the moral argument that the bill doesn't end family separation but instead changes the detention practices, which is morally questionable because it allows indefinite detention. I should highlight that the bill doesn't prevent separations but shifts the method of detention, which is a flawed approach.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, making sure to emphasize the moral issue of not stopping family separation and the indefinite detention aspect.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, presented as a compromise, claims to end family separation at the border. However, it does not outlaw the practice of separating children from their parents. Instead, it removes legal protections that require children to be held in the least restrictive conditions and for limited periods. This change would allow the Trump administration to indefinitely detain families together in ICE custody, effectively replacing separations with indefinite detention. The bill overturns the Flores agreement, which previously limited detention periods and required children to be released without unnecessary delay. Critics argue that the bill does not address the root cause of family separation but instead shifts the method of detention, allowing the administration to keep families in custody for months or years. The moral framing highlights the administration's focus on maximizing detention rather than ensuring family unity, raising concerns about human rights and the treatment of asylum seekers. END OF SUMMARY.
