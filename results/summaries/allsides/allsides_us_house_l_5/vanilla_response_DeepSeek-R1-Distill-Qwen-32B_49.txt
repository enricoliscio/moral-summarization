Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about a Republican immigration bill in the House. It's called a "compromise" but seems to have several components. There's a $25 billion for the border wall, a pathway for DACA recipients to get legal status, and changes to family-based immigration. The key focus, though, is on family separation at the border.

The bill claims to end family separation, but the author argues it doesn't. Instead, it removes protections that prevent indefinite detention of families. The Flores agreement, which limits how long kids can be detained, is being overturned. This means the government can keep families in detention indefinitely.

The Republican summary says accompanied minors won't be separated, but the bill doesn't actually say that. Instead, it allows ICE to detain children with their parents without any time limits. This could lead to families being held for months or years, effectively allowing indefinite detention.

So, the summary needs to capture that the bill doesn't stop family separation but changes how families are detained. It removes the Flores protections, allowing indefinite detention. The Republicans claim it ends separation, but the bill doesn't enforce that. Instead, it gives the administration more power to detain families together, which could mean longer detentions.

I should structure the summary to highlight the main points: the bill's contents, the Flores agreement's role, and the implications of removing those protections. Also, note the Republican claims versus the actual bill's provisions.

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise. Let me make sure I include the key elements without getting too bogged down in details. The focus is on the bill's impact on family detention and separation policies.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, set for House consideration, claims to end family separation at the border but does not outlaw it. Instead, it removes legal protections under the Flores agreement, which limits the detention of children and requires their release "without unnecessary delay." The bill allows ICE to detain families indefinitely, including children, without requiring them to stay together. While Republicans claim the bill prevents separation, it does not stop the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers or separating families. Instead, it would enable indefinite detention of families in ICE facilities, potentially for months or years. The bill also eliminates the requirement for "least restrictive" conditions for detained children, effectively giving the administration broader authority to detain families together or apart. END OF SUMMARY.
