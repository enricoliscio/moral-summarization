Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about a Republican immigration bill that's supposed to prevent family separation, but the author argues that it's deceptive. The bill doesn't actually stop family separation; instead, it ends legal protections that limit how long children can be detained. This means the Trump administration could keep families in detention indefinitely. The author uses strong moral terms like "lying," "separate," "detained," and "loopholes" to criticize the bill.

I need to make sure my summary includes these moral words. I should structure the summary to highlight that the bill doesn't end family separation but allows indefinite detention, which the author sees as a failure to protect children. I'll also mention how the bill undermines the Flores agreement, which previously limited detention periods.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll start by stating the bill's claim to end separation, then explain how it actually removes protections, allowing indefinite detention. I'll include the key moral terms and conclude by noting the bill's deceptive nature and its impact on families.

Let me draft that, making sure to include words like "lying," "separate," "detained," "loopholes," "conditions," and "indefinitely." I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
The Republican immigration bill claims to end family separation at the border but is misleading. It doesnâ€™t outlaw family separation or stop the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers, which leads to parents being detained without their children. Instead, the bill removes legal protections under the Flores agreement, which required children to be kept in the "least restrictive" conditions and not detained longer than necessary. This allows the government to detain families indefinitely. The bill also eliminates the presumption against detaining children with their parents, giving the Secretary of Homeland Security full discretion. While it claims to keep families together, it effectively allows ICE to hold parents and children in detention for months or years. The bill does not prevent family separation or ensure humane conditions for detained children. It is a deceptive attempt to appear compassionate while enabling indefinite detention, which the Trump administration has long sought. END OF SUMMARY.
