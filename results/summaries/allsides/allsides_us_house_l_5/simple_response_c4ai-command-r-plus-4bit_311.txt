SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives released a new immigration bill, claiming it would prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, this is a lie as the bill does not outlaw family separation and does not stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between official border crossings, resulting in parents being detained without their children. The bill removes legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing the administration to detain them indefinitely. The bill's provision overrules the Flores agreement, which requires that kids be released without delay and kept in the least restrictive conditions. The Trump administration blames these protections for forcing them to separate families, but the bill enables them to keep families in detention indefinitely instead of separating them. The bill does not require ICE to keep parents and children together, and it does not address the mechanism the administration uses to separate families. The only reason family separation could end is if the administration chooses to keep families together in detention, which is still detrimental to the well-being of children. 

END OF SUMMARY.
