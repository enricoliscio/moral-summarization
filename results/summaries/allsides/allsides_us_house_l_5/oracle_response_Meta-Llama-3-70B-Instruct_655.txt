SUMMARY:

House Republicans have released a sweeping immigration bill that claims to prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, this claim is a lie. The bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in parents being sent into criminal custody without their children. Instead, the bill gets rid of legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain them indefinitely. This means that if families are kept together, parents must be released with them. The Trump administration has been blaming these protections for "forcing" them to separate families, and the bill would allow them to detain children and parents together in ICE facilities for months or even years. The bill's language is misleading, and its provisions would maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, to prevent them from disappearing into the US as unauthorized immigrants. The bill does not require ICE to keep parents and children together in detention, and it does not address the mechanism used to separate families.

END OF SUMMARY.
