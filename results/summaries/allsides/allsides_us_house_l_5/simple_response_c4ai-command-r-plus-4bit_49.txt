SUMMARY: A new immigration bill released by Republicans in the House of Representatives claims to address the issue of family separation at the US-Mexico border. However, the bill falls short of actually preventing family separation and instead focuses on removing legal protections for children and families in immigration detention. The bill eliminates the requirement to keep children in the least restrictive conditions and allows for indefinite detention of children and families by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This provision overrules the Flores agreement, which has been in place for 20 years and puts limitations on the detention of children. While the bill may lead to the Trump administration stopping family separation, it does so by enabling indefinite detention of families rather than addressing the root cause of the issue. The bill fails to address the mechanism used by the administration to separate families and does not require ICE to keep parents and children together in detention. The bill's approach is immoral and disregards the well-being and best interests of children, prioritizing indefinite detention over family unity.

END OF SUMMARY.
