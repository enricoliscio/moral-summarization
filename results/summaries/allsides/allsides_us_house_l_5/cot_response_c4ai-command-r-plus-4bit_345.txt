SUMMARY: House Republicans have released a controversial immigration bill that they claim will prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, this is a lie. The bill does not outlaw family separation and instead removes legal protections for children and families in immigration detention. It gives the Trump administration the ability to indefinitely detain children and parents in ICE detention centers, which are essentially jails. The bill overrules the Flores agreement, which has protected children from indefinite detention for 20 years. While the agreement does not require family separation, the administration has chosen to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, blaming the so-called "catch and release" policy. The bill also fails to address the mechanism used to separate families, referring parents for prosecution. The only way the bill could end family separation is if the administration chooses to keep families together in detention, which would still result in children being held in jail-like conditions indefinitely until they are either granted legal status or deported. The Republican bill prioritizes border security and cuts to legal family-based immigration over the well-being and moral treatment of immigrant families.
END OF SUMMARY.
