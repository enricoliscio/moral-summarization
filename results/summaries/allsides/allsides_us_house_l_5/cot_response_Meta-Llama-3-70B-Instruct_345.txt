SUMMARY:
The House Republicans' new "compromise" immigration bill is a sweeping plan that covers border security, DACA, and legal family-based immigration. However, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others are misleadingly claiming that it would prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. In reality, the bill doesn't outlaw family separation, and instead, it allows the Trump administration to detain children and parents indefinitely in ICE detention centers. The bill gets rid of the extra legal protections that children and families have in immigration detention, which the Trump administration calls "loopholes". This means that if the family is kept together, their parents must be released with them, but the Trump administration would rather detain families indefinitely. The bill is a thinly veiled attempt to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, and to prevent people from disappearing into the US as unauthorized immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
