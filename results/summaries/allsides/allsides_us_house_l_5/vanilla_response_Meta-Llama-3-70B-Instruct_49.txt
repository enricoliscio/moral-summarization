SUMMARY:

The House Republican "compromise" immigration bill claims to prevent family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it does not outlaw the practice. Instead, it allows the Trump administration to detain children and parents indefinitely in ICE detention centers. The bill gets rid of legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, which the Trump administration calls "loopholes." The bill's provision allows ICE to detain immigrant children with their parents or guardians in the same way it would detain adults, overriding a 20-year-old court agreement that limits child detention. The bill does not specify conditions for detaining children and does not require ICE to keep parents and children together. It would allow the Trump administration to keep families in detention for months or years, potentially leading to indefinite detention. The bill does not address the mechanism used to separate families, and its passage would likely lead to more detention, not less separation.

END OF SUMMARY.
