SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives released a sweeping immigration bill that covers border security, a path to legal status for DACA recipients, and cuts to legal family-based immigration. The bill also addresses the issue of family separation at the US-Mexico border. Despite claims by House Speaker Paul Ryan and others, the bill does not outlaw family separation or prevent the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in parents being separated from their children. Instead, it eliminates legal protections for children in immigration detention, allowing the administration to detain families indefinitely. The bill overrules the Flores agreement, which requires the release of children from detention without unnecessary delay and places them in the least restrictive conditions. The administration has used family separation as a means to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents. The bill does not require ICE to keep parents and children together in detention and does not address the mechanism used to separate families. The only way the bill could end family separation is if the administration chooses to keep families together in detention, resulting in children being held in jail-like facilities with their parents for extended periods.
END OF SUMMARY.
