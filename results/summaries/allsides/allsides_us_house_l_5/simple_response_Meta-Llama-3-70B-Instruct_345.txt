SUMMARY:

The House Republicans' "compromise" immigration bill claims to prevent family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it's a lie. The bill doesn't outlaw family separation, and it doesn't stop the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry. Instead, it gets rid of legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain them indefinitely. The bill would enable the Trump administration to keep children and parents in detention until their cases are resolved, which could take months or even years. This is a morally reprehensible move, as it would essentially jail families, including children, for an indefinite period. The bill's proponents are using deceptive language to make it seem like it's ending family separation, when in reality, it's just replacing one inhumane practice with another.

END OF SUMMARY.
