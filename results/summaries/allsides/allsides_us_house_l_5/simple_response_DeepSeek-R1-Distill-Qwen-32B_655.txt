Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about a Republican immigration bill in the House. It mentions that the bill is presented as a compromise but actually doesn't prevent family separations. The key points are:

1. The bill claims to end family separation but doesn't actually stop the Trump administration from separating families.
2. It removes legal protections for children, like the Flores agreement, which limited detention periods.
3. The bill allows indefinite detention of families, which the administration wanted.
4. The Republican summary is misleading, as the bill doesn't have the language to prevent separation.
5. The Flores agreement is being overruled, allowing ICE to detain families indefinitely.
6. The bill doesn't require families to stay together, so separations could still happen.
7. The article criticizes the bill for not addressing the root of the problem and for misleading the public.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words, keeping the moral perspective. The moral angle is that the bill is deceptive and harmful, allowing indefinite detention and not stopping family separations. I should highlight the misleading claims, the removal of protections, and the potential for indefinite detention.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the bill's claims, then the reality, the removal of the Flores agreement, the possibility of indefinite detention, and the criticism of the Republican summary. I'll make sure to emphasize the deceptive nature and the negative impact on families.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all the key moral points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, presented as a compromise, claims to end family separations at the border. However, it does not outlaw the practice of separating children from their parents. Instead, it removes legal protections like the Flores agreement, which previously required children to be detained in the least restrictive conditions and for limited durations. The bill allows the Trump administration to indefinitely detain families together in ICE custody, effectively replacing family separation with indefinite detention. While the Republican summary falsely claims the bill prevents separations, the actual text permits the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain children alongside their parents without any specific safeguards. This undermines the Flores agreement and enables prolonged detention, which critics argue is a deceptive attempt to justify indefinite family detention under the guise of "ending separations." The bill does not address the root causes of family separation or provide meaningful protections for children, instead perpetuating a harmful system of immigration detention. END OF SUMMARY.
