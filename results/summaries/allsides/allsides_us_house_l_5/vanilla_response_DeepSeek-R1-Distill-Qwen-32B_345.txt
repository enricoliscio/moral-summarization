Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about a Republican immigration bill in the House. It's called a compromise, but the author thinks it's not really a compromise. The bill includes things like funding for the border wall, a path to legal status for DACA recipients, and changes to family-based immigration. 

The main point seems to be about family separation. The Republicans say the bill stops family separation, but the author argues it doesn't. Instead, it removes legal protections that prevent indefinite detention of children with their parents. The Flores agreement, which limits how long kids can be detained, would be overruled. So, the bill would allow the Trump administration to keep families detained together indefinitely, which is what Trump wanted all along. 

The article also mentions that the bill doesn't stop the administration from prosecuting parents, which leads to separation. It just changes how they're detained. The author is critical, saying the Republicans are lying about ending family separation. The bill's real effect is to allow indefinite detention, not stop separations.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the bill's contents, the claim of ending family separation, the reality that it doesn't stop separations but allows indefinite detention, and the criticism of the Republican claims.

The Republican immigration bill, presented as a compromise, includes provisions for border security, a path to legal status for DACA recipients, and changes to family-based immigration. However, contrary to claims, it does not end family separation. Instead, it removes legal protections under the Flores agreement, allowing indefinite detention of families together. The bill eliminates the requirement to release children promptly and keep them in the least restrictive conditions. Critics argue it enables the Trump administration to detain families indefinitely, effectively continuing its detention policies. The bill does not prevent family separation through prosecution but shifts focus to prolonged detention. Thus, while Republicans claim it stops separations, it actually permits indefinite family detention, aligning with Trump's goals. 

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, despite claims of ending family separation, removes protections under the Flores agreement, allowing indefinite detention of families. It doesn't stop separations but permits prolonged detention, aligning with Trump's policies. END OF SUMMARY.
