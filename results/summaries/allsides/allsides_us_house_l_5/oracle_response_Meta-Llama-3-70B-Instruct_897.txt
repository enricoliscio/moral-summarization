SUMMARY:

The House Republican "compromise" immigration bill claims to end family separation at the US-Mexico border, but it's a lie. The bill doesn't outlaw family separation or stop the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US illegally, resulting in parents being sent into criminal custody without their children. Instead, it gets rid of legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain them indefinitely. This means that if families are kept together, parents must be released with them, but the bill allows children and parents to be detained by ICE indefinitely, which is what Trump has wanted all along. The bill's language is misleading, and it doesn't even specify that there are any additional conditions on how children can be detained. In reality, the bill would force families to be detained together in facilities that are essentially jails for months or even years, until they ultimately receive legal status or are deported. The Trump administration would be able to maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents, to prevent people from disappearing into the US as unauthorized immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
