SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives released a so-called "compromise" immigration bill that is slated to reach the House floor next week. This bill addresses a range of issues, from border security to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Speaker Paul Ryan and his allies deceitfully assert that the bill will prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, the bill does not outlaw family separation and does not hinder the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US outside official border crossings, leading to parents being detained separately from their children. The bill eliminates additional legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, such as the requirement to hold children in the "least restrictive" conditions. The bill's proponents claim it ends family separation, but it merely allows the administration to indefinitely detain children alongside their parents in facilities akin to jails. The bill does not address the mechanism used to separate families and does not mandate that ICE keep parents and children together in detention. The only way this bill might end family separation is if the administration chooses to keep families together in detention, which is far from an ideal solution.
END OF SUMMARY.
