SUMMARY:

The newly released Republican immigration bill in the House of Representatives is being misleadingly touted as a solution to the Trump administration's practice of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. In reality, the bill does not outlaw family separation and instead allows for the indefinite detention of children and parents in ICE facilities. The bill gets rid of legal protections that ensure children are kept in the "least restrictive" conditions possible and not detained for longer than necessary. This means that if families are kept together, parents must be released with them. The Trump administration has been blaming these protections for "forcing" them to separate families. The bill's provision allowing ICE to detain immigrant children in the same way as adults would overrule a 20-year-old court agreement that limits the detention of children. The bill's passage would likely lead to the indefinite detention of families, rather than an end to family separation. 

END OF SUMMARY.
