Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about a Republican immigration bill in the House. It covers various aspects like border security, DACA, and family immigration. But the main focus seems to be on family separation and detention.

The author points out that Republicans claim the bill stops family separation, but that's not true. The bill doesn't outlaw it. Instead, it removes legal protections that prevent indefinite detention of children. The Flores agreement, which limits how long kids can be detained, is being overturned. So, the government could keep families in detention longer.

The bill allows ICE to detain kids with their parents indefinitely, which is what Trump wanted. It also doesn't require families to stay together. The author is critical, saying the bill doesn't stop family separation but changes how they're detained, possibly leading to indefinite imprisonment.

I need to capture this moral framing, highlighting the deceptive claims and the real impact on families. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key points: the bill's provisions, the Flores agreement, and the criticism that it doesn't stop separation but allows indefinite detention.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, presented as a "compromise," claims to end family separation at the US-Mexico border. However, it does not outlaw the practice or prevent the Trump administration from prosecuting asylum seekers, which leads to family separation. Instead, the bill removes legal protections under the Flores agreement, allowing the indefinite detention of children and families in ICE custody. While the Republican summary falsely claims it ends family separation, the bill actually permits the detention of children with their parents indefinitely, effectively allowing the Trump administration to keep families in immigration jails for months or years. Critics argue the bill does not stop family separation but instead changes how families are detained, potentially leading to indefinite imprisonment. END OF SUMMARY.
