Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally charged words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about a Republican immigration bill that's supposed to prevent family separation but actually doesn't. Words like "compromise," "sweeping," "border security," "Trumpâ€™s border wall," "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)," "legal status," "green cards," "citizenship," "cuts," "legal family-based immigration," "expanding permanent employer-based immigration," "prevent," "Trump administration," "separating children from their parents," "prosecuting asylum seekers," "illegal entry," "criminal custody," "without their children," "extra legal protections," "least restrictive," "detained," "indefinitely," "ICE detention," "Flores agreement," "detain families," "indefinitely," "detention centers," "jails," "deported."

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. The summary should highlight that the Republican bill doesn't actually stop family separation but allows indefinite detention of families, which is against the Flores agreement. The administration's goal is to maximize detention, leading to indefinite holding of families in ICE facilities.

I should structure the summary to first mention the bill's claims, then expose the truth that it doesn't stop separation but allows indefinite detention. Include the Flores agreement being overturned and the administration's intent to keep families detained. End by noting the moral implications of indefinite detention.

Let me put that together concisely.

The Republican immigration bill claims to end family separation but actually permits indefinite detention of families, overturning the Flores agreement which limited child detention. The bill removes protections requiring children to be held in the least restrictive conditions, allowing ICE to detain families together indefinitely. This aligns with the Trump administration's goal of maximizing detention, resulting in families being held in jails-like facilities for extended periods. The bill's moral framing highlights its failure to protect family unity and its support for prolonged detention, contrary to its stated aim of preventing separation.
