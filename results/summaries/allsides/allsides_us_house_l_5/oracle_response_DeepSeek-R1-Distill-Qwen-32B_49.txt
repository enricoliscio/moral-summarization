Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The article is about a Republican immigration bill that's supposed to prevent family separation but doesn't actually do that. The author is critical, using words like "lying" and "separation."

The bill, according to the author, doesn't outlaw family separation. It removes protections that prevent children from being detained indefinitely. The Flores agreement, which limits how long kids can be detained, is being overruled. The bill allows ICE to detain families together indefinitely, which the administration wants to do instead of separating them.

The author points out that the Republican summary claims the bill ends family separation, but the actual bill doesn't have such language. Instead, it gives ICE more discretion to detain children with their parents, potentially for a long time. This means families could be held in detention centers without the previous 20-day limit.

The moral framing here is about the government's responsibility to protect children and families, not to indefinitely detain them. Words like "separation," "detained," "released," and "loopholes" are important to include as they carry moral weight.

I need to make sure the summary captures that the bill doesn't stop family separation but changes how detention is handled. The author argues that this is a false claim by Republicans, hence the use of "lying." The summary should highlight the continuation of detaining families indefinitely, which is a moral issue.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the bill's claims, then explain what it actually does, and conclude with the moral implications. Keeping it under 200 words and using the specified morally framed words is crucial.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, claimed to end family separation, does not outlaw the practice. Instead, it removes legal protections that prevent children and families from being detained indefinitely. The Flores agreement, which limits detention of children, is overruled, allowing ICE to detain families together without time limits. The bill does not force the government to keep families together but instead permits indefinite detention, effectively continuing the administration's policy of detaining asylum seekers. The Republican summary falsely claims the bill ends family separation, but the text allows ICE to detain children and parents in the same way as adults, with no requirement to keep them together. The Trump administration could still separate families by prosecuting parents, leaving children in HHS custody. The bill does not address this mechanism, and its provisions do not prevent indefinite detention of families. The author argues that the bill does not end family separation but instead perpetuates the detention of families, potentially for months or years, under harsh conditions. END OF SUMMARY.
