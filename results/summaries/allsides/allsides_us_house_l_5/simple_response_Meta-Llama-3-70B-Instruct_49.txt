SUMMARY:

The House Republicans' new immigration bill is being misleadingly touted as a solution to the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. However, the bill does not outlaw family separation, nor does it stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry. Instead, the bill allows the administration to detain children and parents indefinitely, which is what Trump has wanted all along. The bill gets rid of the extra legal protections that children and families have in immigration detention, allowing ICE to detain immigrant children in the same way it would detain adults. This means that families could be held in detention centers for months or even years, until they ultimately receive legal status or are deported. The bill is a thinly veiled attempt to justify the administration's cruel policies, and it does not address the moral outrage of family separation.

END OF SUMMARY.
