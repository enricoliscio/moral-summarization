SUMMARY: Republicans in the House of Representatives released a sweeping immigration bill that includes border security measures, a path to legal status for DACA recipients, and cuts to family-based immigration. Speaker Paul Ryan and others claim the bill would prevent the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the border. However, the bill does not outlaw family separation and does not stop the administration from prosecuting asylum seekers who enter the US between ports of entry, resulting in parents being separated from their children. The bill removes legal protections for children in immigration detention, allowing the administration to detain families indefinitely. The bill's summary claims it ends family separation, but there is no language in the bill to support this. Instead, it overrules the Flores agreement, which limits the government's ability to detain children. The bill allows ICE to detain immigrant children in the same way as adults, potentially keeping families in detention indefinitely. It does not address the mechanism the administration uses to separate families and would likely result in children being held in detention facilities with their parents for extended periods.

END OF SUMMARY.
