SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill released by the House of Representatives is being falsely presented as a solution to the Trump administration's practice of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. The bill does not outlaw family separation or force the government to keep families together. Instead, it removes legal protections for children and families in immigration detention, allowing indefinite detention for children and parents alike. The bill eliminates the requirement for children to be kept in the least restrictive conditions and to be released without unnecessary delay. By overruling the Flores agreement, the bill gives the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to detain immigrant children alongside adults, without any additional conditions on how children can be detained. This is a blatant attempt to justify the administration's "catch and release" policy and maximize the detention of asylum seekers, including parents. The bill fails to address the mechanism used to separate families and does not require ICE to keep parents and children together. The only potential outcome that could end family separation is if the administration chooses to stop prosecuting parents and makes an effort to detain families together. However, this would still result in children being held in jail-like facilities with their parents for extended periods. The bill is a disingenuous attempt to address the issue of family separation and instead prioritizes indefinite detention over keeping families together.
END OF SUMMARY.
