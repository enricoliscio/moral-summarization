Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should focus on using those words as much as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. The Republican bill claims to end family separation but actually allows indefinite detention. The author uses words like "lying," "separate," "detained," etc., which I need to include.

I should structure the summary to highlight that the bill doesn't outlaw family separation but removes protections, allowing indefinite detention. I'll mention the Flores agreement and how the bill overturns it, using terms like "rid" and "detained."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it's concise. I'll start by stating the bill's claims, then explain the reality, using the moral terms. I'll also note that the bill doesn't prevent separation but changes detention conditions.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's moral stance, using the specified words to maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY:  
The Republican immigration bill claims to end family separation at the border, but it does not outlaw the practice. Instead, it removes legal protections that prevent indefinite detention of children and families. The bill eliminates the requirement to keep children in the "least restrictive" conditions and allows ICE to detain families together indefinitely. This would override the Flores agreement, which limits detention of children. While the bill does not explicitly separate families, it gives the Trump administration discretion to detain them without time limits. The author accuses Republicans of "lying" about the bill's intent, as it does not stop family separation but instead allows for indefinite detention. The bill also removes "loopholes" that previously limited detention, enabling the administration to keep families in custody for months or years. The summary highlights the moral implications of "detention," "separation," and "indefinite" holding, emphasizing the bill's failure to address the root causes of family separation. END OF SUMMARY.
