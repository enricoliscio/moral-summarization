Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the Republican immigration bill. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about a compromise bill released by House Republicans. It includes funding for the border wall, a path for DACA recipients to gain legal status, and changes to family-based immigration. But the key focus is on family separation.

House Speaker Paul Ryan claims the bill stops family separation, but the article says that's a lie. The bill doesn't outlaw separating families. It removes legal protections that require children to be held in the least restrictive conditions. So, instead of separating kids from parents, the government can detain families together indefinitely.

The Flores agreement, which limits how long kids can be detained, is being overturned. The bill allows the administration to keep families in detention without time limits. It doesn't require parents and kids to stay together either, so the Trump administration could still separate them if they want.

The article also mentions that the bill doesn't address prosecuting parents for illegal entry, which is a main reason for separation. So, the bill doesn't actually prevent family separation; it just changes how they're detained.

I need to make sure the summary captures that the bill doesn't stop family separation, removes Flores protections, allows indefinite detention, and doesn't require families to stay together. Also, mention that it's a misleading claim by Republicans.

Let me structure this concisely, making sure it's under 200 words and covers all these points.

SUMMARY: The Republican immigration bill, released by the House, aims to address border security, DACA protections, and legal immigration changes. While House Speaker Paul Ryan claims it ends family separation, the bill does not outlaw the practice. Instead, it removes legal protections requiring children to be held in the least restrictive conditions, allowing indefinite family detention. The Flores agreement, which limits detention periods, is overturned. The bill permits the Trump administration to detain families together indefinitely without requiring them to stay together, effectively not stopping separations. It also doesn't address prosecuting parents for illegal entry, a key cause of separation. Thus, the bill misleads by not preventing family separation but changing detention practices. END OF SUMMARY.
