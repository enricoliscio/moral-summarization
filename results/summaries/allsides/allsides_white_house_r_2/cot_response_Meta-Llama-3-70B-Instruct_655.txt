SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump will show concern about Russian hacking into the U.S. election system, which he believes is a serious issue that shouldn't be a source of argument. He criticized Republicans for being more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than about Moscow's alleged meddling in the election, making the U.S. vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama blasted Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Vladimir Putin, calling him an autocratic leader. He emphasized that the U.S. needs a robust response to Russia's actions, which must be carried out in a thoughtful and methodical way. Obama also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents, saying it's unfair and troubling. He insisted on a smooth transition to help Trump's team take over power, despite the controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
