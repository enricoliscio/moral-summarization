SUMMARY: President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump would show appropriate concern about the allegations of Russian hacking during the U.S. election. Obama complained that many Republicans were more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than they were about Moscowâ€™s meddling in the election. Obama said he has great confidence in the assessment of the CIA and FBI that Russia carried out the hacking and that there will be consequences for these cyberattacks. He also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on the stolen Democratic documents and troubled media coverage of Hillary Clinton. Obama promised a thoughtful and methodical response to increase the costs for Russia, and insisted on helping ensure a smooth transition for the Trump administration.
