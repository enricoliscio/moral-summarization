SUMMARY: At a year-end press conference, President Obama expressed concern about allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system and criticized Republicans for their positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama stated that there is great confidence in the assessment that Russia carried out the hacking and that there will be consequences for their actions. He also blamed partisan divides for the lack of a strong response to Russian meddling and chided journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents. Obama declined to answer directly when asked if he believed Russian interference led to Hillary Clinton's loss but did say that she was not treated fairly by the media. The president pledged a smooth transition to the Trump administration and stated that cooperation will continue. The press conference was briefly interrupted when a journalist fainted and had to be helped out of the room.
