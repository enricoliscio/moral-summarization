SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking in the US election system seriously. He criticized Republicans for being more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than addressing Moscow's alleged meddling. Obama stated that he has "great confidence" in the CIA and FBI's assessment that Russia carried out the hacking, and believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved. He also blasted Republican officials and voters for having a positive view of Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of him. Obama warned that partisan divides in Washington make the US vulnerable to foreign influence and promised that there will be "consequences" for Russia's cyberattacks. He also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents.
