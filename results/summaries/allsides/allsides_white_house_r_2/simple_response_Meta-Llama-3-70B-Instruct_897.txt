SUMMARY:

He also blasted GOP voters for having a positive view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of Putin. Obama emphasized that Russia's hacking is a serious issue, and the US needs to take a strong stance against it. He warned that unless the partisan divide changes, the US will remain vulnerable to foreign influence.
