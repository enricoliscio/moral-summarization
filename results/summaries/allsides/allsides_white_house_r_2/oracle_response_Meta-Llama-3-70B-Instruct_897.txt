SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed concern that President-elect Trump may not be taking the allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system seriously enough. He hopes that Trump will show appropriate concern about foreign influence in the election process, which shouldn't be a partisan issue. Obama believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved in the hacking, and that many Republicans were more interested in defeating Hillary Clinton than in taking a stand against Putin's autocratic leadership. The President blasted Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of him. Obama also criticized journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents. He emphasized the need for a robust response to Russia's cyberattacks, including consequences and increased costs for future attacks. Obama pledged to continue cooperating with Trump's team to ensure a smooth transition, despite their differences on the issue.
