Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama addressing Russian hacking in the U.S. election. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

President Obama is talking about his hopes for President-elect Trump to show concern about Russian hacking. He's criticizing Republicans for being more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than addressing the Russian interference. He mentions that many Republicans approve of Putin, which he finds problematic, comparing it to Ronald Reagan disapproving.

He's also talking about how the GOP is more interested in partisan politics than opposing Putin, making the U.S. vulnerable. Obama is confident that Russia was behind the hacking based on intelligence reports. He mentioned telling Putin to stop it during a meeting and that there will be consequences. He's critical of journalists for publishing stolen documents and suggests a thoughtful response from the U.S.

Sen. Ben Sasse is mentioned, saying that just scolding dictators isn't enough and that Congress should consider more robust responses. Obama doesn't directly say if Clinton lost because of Russian meddling but thinks she wasn't treated fairly. He's committed to a smooth transition despite the conflict with Trump's team.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements, like Obama's concern about foreign influence, his criticism of Republicans' priorities, and the need for a strong response to hacking. Also, include the consequences mentioned and the conflict between Obama and Trump's team.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be concise. Start with Obama's hopes for Trump, mention the criticism of Republicans and their approval of Putin. Then talk about the hacking evidence, the consequences, and the call for a thoughtful response. Include Sasse's point about more robust actions. Finally, note Obama's commitment to a smooth transition despite the conflict.

Let me structure that into a coherent summary, making sure to include all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text.
