Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. They also want the summary to end with specific tokens. I need to make sure I understand what the moral framing is here. The article is about President Obama addressing Russian hacking in the U.S. election and his criticism of Republicans and Trump.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. Obama is emphasizing the importance of addressing foreign interference, criticizing Republicans for prioritizing political gains over national security, and expressing concern about the lack of a unified response. He's also pointing out the dangers of Russia's actions and the need for consequences.

Next, I need to ensure the summary captures these moral aspects without adding my own bias. The summary should reflect Obama's concerns about partisanship and the potential vulnerability of the election system. I should mention his criticism of Republicans and Trump, the intelligence reports, and the need for a thoughtful response.

I'll structure the summary to include Obama's hope for Trump's concern, the partisanship issue, the intelligence findings, the consequences for Russia, and the call for a stronger response. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it ends with the required tokens.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count and adjust as necessary to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll ensure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."
