Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. President Obama is talking about Russian hacking in the U.S. election, criticizing Republicans for not being concerned enough and instead focusing on defeating Hillary Clinton. He mentions that many Republicans approve of Putin and that Trump has called him a strong leader, which Obama finds problematic. He also talks about the need for a robust response to Russia's actions, not just blaming journalists or scolding dictators. The summary needs to include as many of the morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

I should start by identifying the key moral elements: concern, hacking, influence, help, approve, divides, hacked, leaked, cyberattacks, retaliation, stolen, response, blaming, scolding, upending, aggressions, meddling, cooperation. I need to weave these into the summary.

First, Obama expresses hope that Trump will be concerned about Russian hacking and foreign influence. He criticizes Republicans for prioritizing defeating Clinton over addressing meddling. He's confident Russia was behind the hacking, based on intelligence. He also criticizes Republicans for approving of Putin and mentions Trump's positive view of him. Obama emphasizes the need for a strong response, not just rhetoric, and mentions that the U.S. will retaliate methodically. He also talks about cooperation during the transition, despite the conflict.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all these points succinctly, using the moral terms where appropriate. I should avoid going into too much detail on each point to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included where relevant.
