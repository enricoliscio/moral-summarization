SUMMARY: President Obama expressed concern about Republican voters' positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of the former KGB head. Obama criticized partisan divides in Washington, blaming the GOP for prioritizing defeating Hillary Clinton over standing against Putin's alleged meddling in the election. He asserted that the US will face continued vulnerability to foreign influence unless this changes. Obama confirmed his belief in the CIA and FBI's assessment that Russia carried out the hacking and stated that he has instructed Putin to "cut it out." The president promised consequences for the cyberattacks and a thoughtful, methodical response from the US. He also chided journalists for publishing news based on stolen Democratic documents. Obama declined to answer whether Clinton's loss was due to Russian meddling but stated that she was not treated fairly during the election. Obama acknowledged the issue of Russian hacking has been caught up in post-election divisions but emphasized his commitment to a smooth transition for Trump's team. He concluded by addressing a journalist who fainted during the news conference.
