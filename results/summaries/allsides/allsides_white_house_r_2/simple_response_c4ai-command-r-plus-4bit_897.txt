SUMMARY: President Obama expressed concern about allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system and criticized Republican officials and voters for their positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama stated that there was no doubt that Russia was responsible for the hacking and that he had warned Putin to "cut it out" in September. He blamed partisan divides in Washington, saying that Republicans were more interested in defeating Hillary Clinton than taking a stand against Putin. Obama also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents. He promised a thoughtful and methodical response to the cyberattacks, increasing the costs to Russia for future cyberattacks. Obama declined to say if he believed Clinton lost due to Russian meddling but stated that she was treated unfairly by the media. He concluded that the issue of Russian hacking had been caught up in election season carryover but would ensure a smooth transition to the Trump administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
