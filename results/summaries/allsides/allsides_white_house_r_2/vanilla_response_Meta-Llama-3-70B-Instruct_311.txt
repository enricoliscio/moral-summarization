SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking of the US election system seriously. Obama criticized Republicans for being more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than addressing Moscow's alleged meddling. He stated that he has "great confidence" in the CIA and FBI's assessment that Russia carried out the hacking, and that Vladimir Putin was likely involved. Obama also blasted Republicans for expressing positive views of Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of the Russian leader. The President warned that partisan divides in Washington make the US vulnerable to foreign influence and announced that there will be "consequences" for Russia's cyberattacks. Obama also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents and said the US response to Russia's actions must be carried out in a "thoughtful, methodical way."
