Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points and the tone.

President Obama is talking about the Russian hacking allegations in the U.S. election. He's expressing concern that President-elect Trump hasn't shown enough worry about foreign interference. He criticizes Republicans for focusing more on defeating Hillary Clinton than addressing Russia's meddling. Obama is confident that Russia was involved, based on intelligence reports, and he believes Putin is behind it. He also criticizes Republicans for approving of Putin, calling it troubling.

Obama mentions that he told Putin to stop the hacking during a meeting and that there will be consequences. He's frustrated with Trump's team rejecting the hacking claims and wants a measured response. He also scolds journalists for publishing leaked documents. There's a Republican senator, Ben Sasse, who thinks the response should be stronger, not just blaming journalists or scolding Putin.

Obama avoids directly saying if Clinton lost because of Russia but implies she wasn't treated fairly. He's committed to a smooth transition despite the tensions.

I need to capture the moral aspects: the concern over foreign influence, criticism of Republicans' priorities, Obama's confidence in the intelligence, the call for consequences, and the frustration with Trump's stance. Also, the call for a robust response from Sasse adds another layer. The summary should highlight these points concisely, under 200 words.
