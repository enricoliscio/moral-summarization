SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed concern that President-elect Trump is not taking the allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system seriously enough. He blasted Republican officials and voters for being more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than about Moscow's alleged meddling in the election. Obama said that the intelligence reports give him "great confidence" in the assessment that Russia carried out the hacking, and that there will be "consequences" for the cyberattacks. He criticized journalists for publishing news stories based on the stolen Democratic documents, calling it "troubling" media coverage. Obama emphasized the need for a "smooth transition" to help Trump's team take over power, despite their differences. He urged Trump to take a "thoughtful, methodical" approach to responding to Russia's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
