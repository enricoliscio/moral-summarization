Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. The user has specific steps: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those terms.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. President Obama is talking about Russian hacking in the U.S. election, criticizing Republicans for not being concerned enough, and expressing hope that Trump will address this issue. He's also criticizing the media for publishing hacked documents and mentions consequences for Russia.

For step one, I need to find words that carry moral implications. Words like "concern," "meddling," "vulnerability," "autocratic," "scolding," "adversaries," "low-cost, high-reward gambles," "unfair," "troubling," "carryover," "cooperation," and "transition." These words reflect judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, the summary needs to include these words while being concise. I'll start by mentioning Obama's hope for Trump's concern, the criticism of Republicans, the assessment of Russian hacking, the media's role, and the consequences mentioned. I'll also note the partisan divides and the need for a robust response. Finally, I'll include the point about the election issues being tied to the hacking and the smooth transition.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, preserving the moral framing without being too verbose. I'll structure it to cover the main points: Obama's concerns, Republican reactions, media criticism, consequences, and the transition process.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Trump would address foreign influence in U.S. elections, criticizing Republicans for prioritizing defeating Hillary Clinton over concerns about Russian meddling. Obama emphasized the intelligence community's confidence in Russia's role in hacking, calling it a threat to democracy. He criticized GOP approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin, labeling it "troubling," and blasted the media for publishing stolen documents. Obama warned of consequences for Russia's cyberattacks and stressed the need for a "thoughtful" response to prevent future vulnerabilities. He also acknowledged the partisan divide in Washington, urging unity to counter foreign interference. Despite the political tension, Obama committed to a smooth transition for Trump's administration. The press conference was briefly interrupted when a journalist fainted.
