SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed his *hope* that President-elect Trump would show *concern* about the *allegations* of Russian hacking during the U.S. election. Obama believes that many Republicans were more focused on defeating Clinton than addressing Russia's *meddling*. He *blamed* this *partisan* divide for leaving the U.S. *vulnerable* to foreign influence. Obama promised a *response* and *retaliation*, stating there would be *consequences* for Russia's actions. He also found the media coverage of Clinton during the election to be *troubling*. Despite the political tension, Obama *insisted* on a smooth transition, stating that his team has done everything they can and that their *cooperation* will continue. Obama's comments reflect a growing hostility between the White House and Trump's team over the Russian hacking scandal.
