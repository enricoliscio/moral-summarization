Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. First, I need to understand the task clearly. The user wants two things: a list of morally framed single words and a summary that preserves those moral frames.

Looking at the article, I see President Obama discussing Russian hacking and the response from Trump and Republicans. The moral framing here involves words that convey judgment or evaluation, like "concern," "meddling," "vulnerable," etc. I need to extract all such words first.

I'll go through the article paragraph by paragraph, identifying each morally charged word. Words like "concern," "meddling," "vulnerable," "autocratic," "scolding," "adversaries," "gambles," "fairly," "troubling," and "cooperation" stand out. These words carry moral weight because they imply judgment on actions or actors.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. The summary should include as many of these morally framed words as possible without exceeding 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: Obama's concerns about Russian interference, criticism of Republicans, his assertion of Russian responsibility, the need for a robust response, and the ongoing transition despite political tensions.

I must ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral perspective from the original text. I'll start by highlighting Obama's hope for Trump's concern, mention the criticism of Republicans, state the intelligence findings, discuss the consequences, and touch on the need for a strong response. I'll also include the media's role and the transition process.

I need to make sure each sentence in the summary incorporates the moral words appropriately. For example, using "concerned," "meddling," "vulnerable," and "scolding." I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article and stick to the key points.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all morally framed words are included where relevant. This approach should meet the user's requirements effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama expressed concern over Russian meddling in the U.S. election, criticizing Republicans for prioritizing defeating Hillary Clinton over addressing foreign influence. He emphasized the need for unity in combating Russian interference, stating that "not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin." Obama asserted that intelligence reports confirmed Russian hacking, calling for consequences to deter future attacks. He criticized Republicans for approving of Putin and warned that partisan divides make the U.S. vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama also scolded journalists for publishing stolen documents, while Sen. Ben Sasse argued for a more robust response to Russia. The president declined to directly link Russian meddling to Clinton's loss but criticized media coverage of her campaign. Despite political tensions, Obama vowed to ensure a smooth transition for Trump's administration.
