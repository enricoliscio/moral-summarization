SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking in the US election system seriously, unlike many Republicans who prioritized defeating Hillary Clinton over addressing Moscow's alleged meddling. Obama criticized GOP officials and voters for having a positive view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing a poll where 37% of Republican voters approved of him. He blamed partisan divides for making the US vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama reiterated that Russia is responsible for the hacking and promised "consequences" for the cyberattacks, which will increase the "costs" to Russia of future attacks. He also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents. Obama's comments were met with criticism from Sen. Ben Sasse, who advocated for a more robust response to Russia.
