Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's comments on Russian hacking and the election. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave, and it should be under 200 words. They also specified that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama is talking about hoping Trump will address Russian hacking, criticizes Republicans for prioritizing defeating Clinton over the issue, mentions the intelligence reports, and expresses concern about foreign influence. He also criticizes Republicans for approving of Putin and says the GOP is more focused on partisanship than opposing Russia. He's confident Russia did the hacking, mentioned confronting Putin, and plans consequences. He also criticized journalists for publishing stolen info. There's a mention of a Republican senator suggesting a stronger response, and the article ends with a fainting incident.

I need to make sure the summary captures Obama's moral stance: the importance of unity against foreign interference, the criticism of Republicans for partisanship, and the need for a strong response. Also, include the key points like the 37% approval of Putin among Republicans, the intelligence confidence, the call for consequences, and the part about the transition despite differences.

I should structure the summary to start with Obama's hope for Trump, then move to his criticism of Republicans, mention the intelligence, his comments on partisanship, the consequences, and the transition. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go. Also, make sure to include the fainting incident briefly at the end as it's part of the context.

Wait, the user mentioned the summary should preserve the moral framing. So I need to highlight Obama's emphasis on the importance of the issue beyond partisanship and the need for a strong, united response against foreign interference. Also, his criticism of the GOP for focusing on Clinton over the hacking issue is a key moral point.

I think I have all the elements. Now, I'll put it together concisely, making sure each sentence flows logically and covers all necessary points without being too wordy.

END OF SUMMARY.
