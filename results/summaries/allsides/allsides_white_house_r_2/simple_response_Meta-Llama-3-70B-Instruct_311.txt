SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking in the US election system seriously, unlike many Republicans who prioritized defeating Hillary Clinton over addressing Moscow's alleged meddling. Obama emphasized that foreign influence in elections should not be a partisan issue. He criticized Republican officials and voters for having a positive view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of Putin. Obama blamed partisan divides for the GOP's lack of action against Russia, warning that this vulnerability will continue unless it changes. He reiterated that Russia is responsible for the hacking and promised "consequences" for the cyberattacks. Obama also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents.
