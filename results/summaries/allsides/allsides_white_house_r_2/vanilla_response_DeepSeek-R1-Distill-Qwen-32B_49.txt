Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President Obama addressing concerns regarding Russian hacking in the U.S. election. He's speaking at his year-end press conference. He mentions that he hopes President-elect Trump will show concern about foreign influence in elections. He criticizes Republicans for being more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than addressing Russian meddling. He's confident based on intelligence that Russia did the hacking and mentions telling Putin to stop it during their meeting. He also criticizes Trump and Republicans for positive views of Putin. He says the U.S. will retaliate but in a methodical way. He's critical of journalists for publishing stolen documents. He believes the media coverage was unfair to Clinton. He mentions the election issue is still a topic due to the transition. The conference was interrupted by a journalist fainting.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the main points: Obama's hope for Trump's concern, criticism of Republicans, confidence in Russian hacking, Putin's involvement, criticism of Trump and Republicans' views on Putin, planned retaliation, criticism of media, unfair treatment of Clinton, and the interruption during the conference.

I should structure it clearly, starting with Obama's hope, then his criticism, the intelligence, Putin's role, the planned response, media criticism, Clinton's treatment, and the interruption. Make sure it's concise and flows well.

Let me check the word count as I go. I'll make sure each sentence covers a main point without unnecessary details. Avoiding jargon and keeping it straightforward.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes all key points.
