SUMMARY: President Obama held a year-end press conference at the White House, expressing his concerns about the allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system and the lack of appropriate concern from President-elect Donald Trump and many Republicans.

He criticized Republican officials and voters for their positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that this should not be a partisan issue.
