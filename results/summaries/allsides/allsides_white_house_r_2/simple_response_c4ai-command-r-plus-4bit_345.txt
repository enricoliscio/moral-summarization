SUMMARY: President Obama expressed concern over allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system, urging President-elect Donald Trump to address the issue appropriately. He criticized Republican officials and voters for their positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that the GOP seemed more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than on countering Russian meddling. Obama stated that there will be consequences for Russia's cyberattacks and that the U.S. response will increase the costs of future attacks. He also chastised journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents. The president blamed partisan divides for the lack of a united front against Russian interference and pledged a smooth transition for the Trump administration despite their rejection of the hacking allegations. He expressed confidence in the assessments of the CIA and FBI that Russia was responsible for the hacking. Obama's comments highlight the serious ethical implications of foreign influence in U.S. elections and the need for a robust and united response to protect the integrity of the democratic process.
