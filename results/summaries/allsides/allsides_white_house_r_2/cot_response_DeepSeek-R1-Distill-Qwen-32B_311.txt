Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral language used.

President Obama is talking about Russian hacking into the U.S. election system. He's expressing hope that Trump will take it seriously, but he's critical of Republicans who were more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than on the foreign interference. He mentions that many Republicans approve of Putin, which he finds concerning, comparing it to Reagan's disapproval. He's also critical of the GOP for being more interested in partisan politics than standing against Russia. He's certain Russia did the hacking and wants consequences, but in a thoughtful way. He also criticizes journalists for publishing stolen documents. There's a Republican senator suggesting a stronger response, and the article ends with a minor incident during the press conference.

Now, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

- Concern
- Appropriate concern
- Meddling
- Vulnerable
- Blasted
- Approval
- Strong leader (this is positive but in a negative context because Obama disapproves)
- Autocratic
- Hostile
- Scolding
- Vague
- Winning strategy
- Robust response
- Adversaries
- Low-cost, high-reward gambles
- Fair
- Troubling
- Cooperation

Wait, some of these might not be single words. For example, "low-cost, high-reward gambles" is a phrase, so I should only take "adversaries" as a single word. Similarly, "thoughtful, methodical way" is a phrase, so "thoughtful" is a single word but might not carry a strong moral connotation here.

I think I should focus on words that carry a clear moral judgment. Let me list them again:

- Concern (appropriate concern)
- Meddling
- Vulnerable
- Blasted
- Approval
- Strong leader (but used negatively)
- Autocratic
- Hostile
- Scolding
- Vague
- Winning strategy
- Robust response
- Adversaries
- Fair
- Troubling
- Cooperation

Wait, "strong leader" is a positive term but used in a negative context because Obama is critical of that view. So maybe include it as a morally framed word because it's being criticized.

Now, moving to the summary. I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. The summary should capture Obama's concerns about Russian interference, criticism of Republicans, his certainty about Russia's involvement, desire for consequences, and the call for a robust response.

I'll structure it by first stating Obama's hope for Trump's concern, then his criticism of Republicans, mention of Putin's approval, the need for consequences, criticism of journalists, the call for a robust response, and the note on cooperation despite the issues.

I need to make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate without making the summary too long. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.
