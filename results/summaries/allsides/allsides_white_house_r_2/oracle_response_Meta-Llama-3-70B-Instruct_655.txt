SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed concern that President-elect Trump is not showing appropriate concern about allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system. He believes that many Republicans were more interested in defeating Hillary Clinton than in preventing Moscow's alleged meddling in the election. Obama hopes that Trump will be concerned about ensuring that foreign influence does not affect the election process. He criticized Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of him. Obama blamed partisan divides in Washington, saying the GOP was more interested in hurting Democrats than taking a stand against Putin's autocratic leadership. He emphasized the need for a robust response to Russia's cyberattacks, warning that unless the country takes a stand, it will continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents, calling for a thoughtful and methodical response to Russia's actions.
