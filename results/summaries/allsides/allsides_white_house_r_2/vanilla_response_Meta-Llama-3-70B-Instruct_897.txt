SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Donald Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking into the US election system seriously. Obama criticized Republicans for being more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than addressing Moscow's alleged meddling. He stated that intelligence reports give him "great confidence" in the assessment that Russia carried out the hacking. Obama also blasted Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of Putin. The President blamed partisan divides in Washington, saying the GOP was more interested in hurting Democrats than taking a stand against Putin. Obama warned that unless this changes, the US will continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence. He also announced that there will be "consequences" for Russia's cyberattacks, which will increase the "costs" of future cyberattacks.
