SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed concern that President-elect Trump and many Republicans are not taking allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system seriously enough. He believes that Russia's alleged meddling in the election should not be a partisan issue, but rather a matter of national security. Obama criticized Republicans for being more interested in defeating Hillary Clinton than in standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he accused of being behind the hacking. The President also blasted Trump for praising Putin as a strong leader, saying it would have made Ronald Reagan "roll over in his grave." Obama emphasized that the U.S. must take a strong stance against Russia's cyberattacks, warning that partisan divides in Washington make the country vulnerable to foreign influence.
