Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's comments on Russian hacking and the transition to Trump. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, Obama is talking about his hope that Trump will address Russian interference in the election. He criticizes Republicans for being more focused on defeating Clinton than on the hacking issue. He mentions that many GOP voters approve of Putin, which he finds concerning. He also states that the intelligence reports give him confidence that Russia was involved.

Obama also addresses the media's role in publishing leaked documents and criticizes Trump's positive view of Putin. He mentions that he told Putin to stop the hacking during their meeting and that there will be consequences. He emphasizes a thoughtful response rather than immediate actions.

There's also mention of a journalist fainting during the press conference, causing a brief interruption.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the key points: Obama's hope for Trump's concern, criticism of Republicans, intelligence confidence, media criticism, consequences for Russia, and the interruption.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each main point is covered without going into too much detail. I should avoid jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward.

I should start with Obama's hope for Trump's concern, then move to his criticism of Republicans and GOP voters' approval of Putin. Then mention the intelligence reports and his meeting with Putin. Next, include the criticism of the media and the consequences. Finally, note the interruption during the conference.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and covers all essential points without exceeding the word limit. Let me check the word count as I draft each section to stay within the limit.

Okay, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and covers all the key elements.
