SUMMARY: President Obama held a year-end press conference on Friday, where he addressed the issue of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system and its potential impact on the election results. Obama expressed hope that President-elect Trump would take the allegations seriously and work to prevent foreign influence in future elections. He stated that the intelligence reports give him "great confidence" in the assessment that Russia carried out the hacking and that he personally told Putin to "cut it out." Obama criticized Republican officials and voters for their positive views of Putin and blamed partisan divides for the lack of a strong response to Russia's actions. He also chided journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents. Obama suggested that the U.S. will retaliate against Russia in a "thoughtful, methodical way." When asked if he believed Hillary Clinton lost due to Russian meddling, Obama declined to answer directly but stated that she was not treated fairly by the media. He concluded by emphasizing the importance of a smooth transition for the Trump administration.
END OF SUMMARY.
