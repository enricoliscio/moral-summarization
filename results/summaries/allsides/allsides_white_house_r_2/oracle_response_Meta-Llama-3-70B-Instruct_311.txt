SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed concern that President-elect Trump should show appropriate concern about allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system. He criticized many Republicans for being more interested in defeating Hillary Clinton than in addressing Moscow's alleged meddling in the election. Obama emphasized that foreign influence in the election process should not be a partisan issue. He also blasted Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of the former head of the KGB. Obama accused the GOP of being more interested in hurting Democrats than taking a stand against Putin's autocratic leadership. He warned that unless this partisan divide changes, the U.S. will continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama also announced that there will be consequences for Russia's cyberattacks, and that the U.S. response will increase the costs to Russia of future cyberattacks.
