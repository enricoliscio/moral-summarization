SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed his *hope* that President-elect Donald Trump will show *concern* about allegations of Russian *meddling* in the U.S. election. Obama *complained* that many Republicans were more *worried* about defeating Hillary Clinton than about Russia's alleged interference. He *blasted* Republican officials and voters for expressing *positive* views of Vladimir Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of the former KGB head. Obama blamed *partisan divides* in Washington, saying the GOP was more interested in *hurting* Democrats than taking a *stand* against Putin. The president called for a *thoughtful* and *methodical* response to the cyberattacks, promising *consequences* for Russia. Obama also *chided* journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents. He *insisted* on a smooth transition to help Trump's team take power.
