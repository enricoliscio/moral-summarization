SUMMARY: President Obama held a year-end press conference at the White House, expressing his concerns about the allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system and the lack of appropriate concern from President-elect Donald Trump and many Republicans. Obama stated that there is great confidence in the assessment of the CIA and FBI that Russia carried out the hacking and that there will be consequences for such actions. He criticized Republican officials and voters for their positive views of Vladimir Putin and blamed partisan divides for the lack of a strong response to Russian meddling. Obama also chided journalists for publishing news based on stolen Democratic documents. The president believes that there should be a smooth transition to help Mr. Trump's team take over power, and he will continue to cooperate with the incoming administration. During the conference, a journalist fainted, and Obama showed concern and asked for medical assistance.
