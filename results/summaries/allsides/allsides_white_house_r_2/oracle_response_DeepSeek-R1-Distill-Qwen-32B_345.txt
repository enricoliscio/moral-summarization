Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is discussing Russian hacking in the election, criticizing Republicans for not being concerned enough, and expressing hope that Trump will address the issue. He's also critical of the media and suggests consequences for Russia. 

I should start by mentioning Obama's hope for Trump's concern about Russian influence. Then, note his criticism of Republicans prioritizing defeating Clinton over addressing meddling. I'll include the hacking and leaking details, as well as his confidence in the intelligence reports. 

Next, I need to address the part where Obama criticizes Republicans for approving of Putin and compares it to Reagan's disapproval. Also, mention the partisan divides and the need for a robust response. 

I should include the media's role in publishing stolen documents and the consequences Obama mentions, like increasing costs for Russia. Finally, touch on the smooth transition despite the issues. 

I'll make sure to use the morally framed words like concern, hacking, influence, help, approve, divides, hacked, leaked, cyberattacks, retaliation, stolen, response, blaming, scolding, upending, responses, hack, aggressions, meddling, coverage, cooperation. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral terms.
