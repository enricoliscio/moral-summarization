Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is talking about Russian hacking in the U.S. election. He's concerned that Trump isn't showing enough concern about foreign influence. He mentions Republicans were more focused on defeating Clinton than addressing the meddling. He's confident Russia did the hacking based on intelligence. He criticizes Republicans for approving of Putin and their partisan divides. He says the U.S. will retaliate but in a thoughtful way. He also talks about the media's role in publishing stolen documents. Some Republicans, like Sen. Sasse, think the response should be stronger. Obama avoids directly saying Clinton lost because of Russia but thinks she wasn't treated fairly. He emphasizes cooperation for the transition despite the issues.

Now, I'll identify the morally framed words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like concern, hacking, influence, help, approve, divides, hacked, leaked, cyberattacks, retaliation, stolen, response, blaming, scolding, upending, responses, hack, aggressions, meddling, coverage, done, cooperation, continue.

I need to structure the summary to include these words. Start with Obama's hope for Trump's concern about Russian hacking. Mention the Republicans' focus on defeating Clinton over influence. Highlight his confidence in the hacking by Russia. Criticize Republicans for approving Putin and their partisan divides. Note the need for a robust response and the media's role in publishing stolen docs. Mention the planned retaliation and cooperation despite issues.

I should make sure the summary flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

Wait, I should also check the word count to stay under 200. Let me outline the key points:

1. Obama hopes Trump shows concern about Russian hacking and foreign influence.
2. Criticism of Republicans for focusing on defeating Clinton.
3. Confidence in Russia's hacking based on intelligence.
4. GOP's positive views on Putin.
5. Partisan divides in Washington.
6. Retaliation plan but in a thoughtful manner.
7. Media's role in publishing stolen documents.
8. Republican call for stronger response.
9. Avoiding direct blame on Russia for Clinton's loss but criticizing media coverage.
10. Emphasis on cooperation for transition.

Now, I'll try to condense these points using the moral words. Let me see if I can fit all without exceeding the word limit. Maybe combine some points to save words. For example, instead of listing each point separately, group related ideas.

I think I can manage it by being concise. Let me try to write the summary now, making sure to include the key moral terms and maintain the flow.
