SUMMARY: President Obama expressed concern over Russian hacking into the U.S. election system and criticized Republicans for their positive views of Vladimir Putin. He stated that there was great confidence in the assessment that Russia carried out the hacking and that there will be consequences for their actions. Obama also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents. He blamed partisan divides for the lack of a strong response to Russian meddling and called for a more robust reaction, including diplomatic, economic, military, and cyber responses. Obama declined to say if he believed Russian interference caused Hillary Clinton's loss but did say that she was not treated fairly by the media. Despite the tensions, Obama pledged to continue cooperation with the Trump team to ensure a smooth transition.
