SUMMARY:
At a year-end press conference, President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump will show appropriate concern about allegations of Russian hacking during the U.S. election. Obama complained that many Republicans were more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than they were about Moscowâ€™s alleged meddling. He blasted GOP officials and voters for their positive views of Russian President Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of the former KGB head. Obama blamed partisan divides for the lack of a strong response to Russian influence, saying that the GOP was more interested in hurting Democrats than standing against Putin. 

The White House has been critical of the Trump team for rejecting claims of Russian hacking, which Obama says he has great confidence in. Obama has vowed consequences for the cyberattacks, promising a thoughtful and methodical response that will increase costs for Russia. He also chided journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents and expressed disappointment in the media's treatment of Clinton. Despite the political divisions, Obama acknowledged the importance of a smooth transition and vowed to continue cooperation with the Trump team during the transition process. The press conference was briefly interrupted when a journalist fainted and was assisted by staff and a summoned physician. END OF SUMMARY.
