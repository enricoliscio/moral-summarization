SUMMARY: President Obama held a year-end press conference where he addressed the issue of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system and criticized President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans for their response to the allegations. Obama expressed hope that Trump would show concern about the hacking and take a stand against foreign influence in U.S. elections. He stated that the intelligence reports give him confidence in the assessment that Russia was responsible for the hacking and that there will be consequences for their actions. Obama also criticized Republicans for expressing positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed partisan divides for the lack of a strong response to Russia's actions. He chided journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents and promised a thoughtful and methodical response to the cyberattacks. Obama declined to say if he believed Russian meddling cost Hillary Clinton the election but did say that she was treated unfairly by the media. The president also emphasized the importance of a smooth transition for the Trump team. The press conference was briefly interrupted when a journalist fainted.
