SUMMARY: President Obama expressed concern over allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system, urging President-elect Donald Trump to show appropriate concern as well. Obama criticized Republicans for their positive views of Vladimir Putin and their focus on defeating Hillary Clinton rather than addressing Russian meddling. He stated that there will be consequences for the cyberattacks and that the U.S. response will increase the costs to Russia. Obama also chided journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents. Obama's comments come as the White House has grown hostile towards Trump and his team for rejecting allegations of Russian hacking and leaking. Obama emphasized the need for a thoughtful and methodical response to Russia's actions, while also ensuring a smooth transition for the Trump administration. The issue of Russian hacking has highlighted partisan divides in Washington, with some calling for a more robust response to Putin's aggressions. Obama declined to directly answer whether Clinton's loss was due to Russian influence but did say that she was treated unfairly by the media.
