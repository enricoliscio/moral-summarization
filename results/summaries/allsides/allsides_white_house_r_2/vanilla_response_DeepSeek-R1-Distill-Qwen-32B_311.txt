Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. They provided a detailed news article about President Obama's comments regarding Russian hacking in the U.S. election and Trump's response. The task is to summarize this article concisely, within 200 words, using specific tokens.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. Obama is expressing hope that Trump will address Russian interference in the election. He criticizes Republicans for prioritizing defeating Clinton over the issue. He's confident based on intelligence that Russia was involved and has confronted Putin about it. He also criticizes Trump and Republicans for positive views of Putin. He mentions consequences for Russia but emphasizes a thoughtful response. There's some pushback from Trump's team, and a Republican senator suggests a stronger approach. Obama avoids directly linking Russian meddling to Clinton's loss but mentions media coverage issues. The press conference had an interruption with a journalist fainting.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary. I should focus on the main elements: Obama's concerns, his confidence in the intelligence, criticism of Republicans and Trump, the consequences mentioned, the response from Trump's team, the senator's input, and the media aspect. Also, the interruption at the press conference is a minor detail but worth including for completeness.

I'll structure the summary to cover each of these points succinctly, ensuring it flows logically and stays under 200 words. I'll make sure to include the key actors and their positions, the intelligence findings, the consequences, and the broader implications of the issue. I'll avoid getting bogged down in minor details to keep it concise.

Finally, I'll format the summary with the required tokens, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll ensure the language is clear and direct, capturing all essential information without unnecessary fluff.
