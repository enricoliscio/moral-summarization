SUMMARY: President Obama expressed concern over Republican voters' positive views of Vladimir Putin, noting that many Republicans were more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than they were about Russia's influence in the election through hacking. Obama stated that there is great confidence in the assessment that Russia carried out the hacking and that there will be consequences for such cyberattacks. He criticized journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents and chided the GOP for being more interested in partisan divides than taking a stand against Russian aggression. Obama emphasized the need for a thoughtful and methodical response to increase the costs of future cyberattacks for Russia. He also declined to answer whether he believed Clinton lost due to Russian meddling but did say that she was not treated fairly by the media. Despite the differences, Obama committed to ensuring a smooth transition for the Trump administration.
