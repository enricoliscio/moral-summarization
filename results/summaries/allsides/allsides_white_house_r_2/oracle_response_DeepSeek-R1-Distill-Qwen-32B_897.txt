Okay, so the user has provided a detailed news article and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They've listed specific morally charged words that should be included. I need to make sure the summary uses as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Obama is expressing concern about Trump not showing appropriate concern over Russian hacking. He's critical of Republicans for prioritizing defeating Clinton over addressing foreign influence. He's confident about Russian responsibility based on intelligence, and he's criticized Trump and GOP voters for approving of Putin. He also mentions the need for a robust response and cooperation in the transition.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary. I'll start with Obama's hope that Trump shows concern. Then mention the hacking allegations and the criticism of Republicans. Include his confidence in the intelligence, the call for a response, and the criticism of Trump and GOP voters. Also, touch on the need for cooperation despite the transition.

I should ensure that words like "concern," "hacking," "influence," "approve," "response," "retaliation," and "cooperation" are included. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, making sure each key point is covered concisely.

Let me check the word count to stay under 200. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and captures the moral elements without being too verbose. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and start with "SUMMARY:".

Alright, putting it all together, ensuring the moral framing is preserved and the key points are included within the word limit.
