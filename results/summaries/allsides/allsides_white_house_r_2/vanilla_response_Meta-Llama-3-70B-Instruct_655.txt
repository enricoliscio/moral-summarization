SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking in the US election system seriously, unlike many Republicans who were more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton. Obama stated that he has "great confidence" in the CIA and FBI's assessment that Russia carried out the hacking, and that not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin's involvement. He criticized Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of the former KGB head. Obama blamed partisan divides in Washington for the GOP's lack of action against Russian influence, and warned that unless this changes, the US will remain vulnerable to foreign influence. He also announced that there will be "consequences" for Russia's cyberattacks, which will be carried out in a "thoughtful, methodical way".
