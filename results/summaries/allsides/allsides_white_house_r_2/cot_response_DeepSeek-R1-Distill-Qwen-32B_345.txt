Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a detailed news article about President Obama addressing Russian hacking during the 2016 election. They want a summary that keeps the moral words intact.

First, I should go through the article to identify all the single words that carry moral implications. Words like "concern," "manipulate," "vulnerable," etc. These words are crucial because they set the tone and the moral stance of the original text.

Next, I'll create a concise summary. I need to make sure that the summary includes as many of these moral words as possible without making it too long. The user specified a maximum of 200 words, so I have to be efficient.

I'll start by outlining the main points: Obama's concerns about Trump's attitude, the hacking allegations, the intelligence reports, the criticism of Republicans, the consequences of the attacks, and the transition process. Each of these points should include the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I also need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without getting bogged down in details. It's important to highlight the key players and their stances, like Trump's support for Putin and Obama's criticism of the GOP's priorities.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's within the word limit and that all the moral words are appropriately included. I should also check that the summary accurately reflects the original article's content and moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
President Obama expressed concern over President-elect Trump's attitude toward Russian hacking allegations, criticizing Republicans for prioritizing defeating Hillary Clinton over addressing foreign interference. Obama emphasized the need to protect elections from foreign influence, stating Russia's hacking was "without a doubt" the case. He criticized GOP support for Putin, calling it troubling, and blasted the party for focusing on partisanship rather than opposing autocratic leaders. Obama vowed consequences for Russia's cyberattacks, though he declined to directly answer if Clinton lost due to Russian meddling. He also criticized journalists for publishing stolen documents. The press conference was briefly interrupted when a journalist fainted. Obama assured cooperation with Trump's transition, despite growing tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
