SUMMARY: At a year-end press conference, President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Donald Trump would show concern about allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system. Obama stated that he has great confidence in the assessment of the CIA and FBI that Russia carried out the hacking and that there will be consequences for these cyberattacks. He criticized Republican officials and voters for their positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of him. Obama also blamed partisan divides in Washington for the lack of a strong response to Russian meddling. He chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents and stated that the U.S. retaliation for Russia's actions must be carried out thoughtfully and methodically. When asked if he believed Hillary Clinton lost due to Russian interference, Obama declined to answer directly but stated that she was not treated fairly by the media. The press conference was briefly interrupted when a journalist fainted.
