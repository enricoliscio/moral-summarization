SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking of the US election system seriously, unlike many Republicans who prioritized defeating Hillary Clinton over addressing Moscow's alleged meddling. Obama criticized Republicans for their positive views of Vladimir Putin, citing a poll that showed 37% of GOP voters approve of the former KGB head. He blamed partisan divides in Washington for the GOP's lack of action against Russia, saying it makes the US vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama reiterated that Russia is responsible for the hacking and promised "consequences" for the cyberattacks. He also chided journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents. The president emphasized the need for a smooth transition to help Trump's team take over power, despite their differing views on the issue.
