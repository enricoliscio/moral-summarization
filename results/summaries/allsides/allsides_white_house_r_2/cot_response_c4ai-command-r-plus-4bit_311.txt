SUMMARY: President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump will show appropriate concern about the allegations of Russian hacking during the U.S. election. Obama blamed partisan divides in Washington for the lack of a strong response to Putin's aggressions, arguing that Republicans were more worried about defeating Clinton than about Russia's meddling. The President vowed that there will be consequences and retaliation for the cyberattacks, and that the U.S. response will increase the costs to Russia. Obama also chided journalists for publishing stories based on the stolen documents and acknowledged that Clinton was not treated fairly by the media during the election. He insisted on a smooth transition for the Trump team, acknowledging that his administration has cooperated fully. Obama's comments come as the White House has grown hostile towards Trump's dismissal of Russia's role in the hacking, with the President-elect calling for toned-down rhetoric.
