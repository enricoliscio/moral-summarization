SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump will show concern about allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system, which he believes is a serious issue that shouldn't be the source of an argument. He criticized many Republicans for being more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than about Moscow's alleged meddling in the election. Obama blasted Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him an autocratic leader. He emphasized that the U.S. needs to take a strong stand against foreign influence in elections, warning that unless this changes, the country will continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama also announced that there will be consequences for Russia's cyberattacks, and that the U.S. response will increase the costs to Russia of future cyberattacks. END OF SUMMARY.
