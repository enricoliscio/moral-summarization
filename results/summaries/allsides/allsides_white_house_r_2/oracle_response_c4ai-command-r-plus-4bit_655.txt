SUMMARY: President Obama expressed concern over allegations of Russian hacking into the U.S. election system, stating that many Republicans were more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than addressing Moscow's meddling. He hopes that President-elect Donald Trump will show appropriate concern about foreign influence in the election process. Obama has great confidence in the assessment of the CIA and FBI that Russia carried out the hacking and has blamed partisan divides for the lack of a strong response. He believes the GOP was more interested in hurting Democrats than taking a stand against Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The White House has grown hostile towards Trump and his team for rejecting claims of Russian involvement. Obama has promised consequences and increased costs for Russia, but also chided journalists for publishing stories based on stolen Democratic documents. He believes Clinton was not treated fairly by the media during the election and that the issue of Russian hacking has been caught up in election season carryover. Despite the differences, Obama remains committed to ensuring a smooth transition for the Trump team.
END OF SUMMARY.
