SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed hope that President-elect Trump will take concerns about Russian hacking into the US election system seriously, unlike many Republicans who were more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton. Obama stated that he has "great confidence" in the CIA and FBI's assessment that Russia carried out the hacking, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely involved. He criticized Republican officials and voters for having a positive view of Putin, citing a poll that found 37% of Republican voters approve of him. Obama blamed partisan divides in Washington for the lack of action against Russian interference, saying that unless this changes, the US will remain vulnerable to foreign influence. He also announced that there will be "consequences" for Russia's cyberattacks, which will increase the "costs" of future attacks.
