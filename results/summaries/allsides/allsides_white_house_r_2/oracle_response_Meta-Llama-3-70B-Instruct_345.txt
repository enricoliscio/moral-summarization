SUMMARY:

President Obama expressed concern that President-elect Trump may not be concerned enough about Russian hacking into the US election system. He believes that many Republicans were more interested in defeating Hillary Clinton than in addressing Moscow's alleged meddling in the election. Obama hopes that Trump will take a stand against foreign influence in the election process, as it shouldn't be a source of argument. He criticized Republican officials and voters for expressing positive views of Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of him. Obama blasted the GOP for being more interested in hurting Democrats than taking a stand against Putin's autocratic leadership. He emphasized that unless this changes, the US will continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence. Obama also condemned journalists for publishing news stories based on stolen Democratic documents and called for a thoughtful, methodical response to Russia's cyberattacks.
