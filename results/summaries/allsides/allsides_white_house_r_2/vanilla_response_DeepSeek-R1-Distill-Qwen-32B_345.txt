Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

President Obama is talking about the Russian hacking allegations in the U.S. election. He's addressing President-elect Trump, hoping he'll take the issue seriously. Obama criticizes Republicans for being more focused on defeating Hillary Clinton than on the foreign interference. He mentions that the intelligence reports give him confidence that Russia was involved, and he even says that Putin is likely behind it because not much happens in Russia without him. 

Obama also criticizes Republicans for approving of Putin, citing a poll where 37% of GOP voters approve. He compares this to Reagan rolling over in his grave, which is a strong statement. He blames the partisan divide in Washington, saying the GOP is more focused on attacking Democrats than opposing Putin. 

The White House is frustrated with Trump's team for rejecting their claims about the hacking. Obama is sure Russia is responsible and told Putin to stop it during their meeting. He mentions consequences for the cyberattacks, but wants the response to be thoughtful. He also chides journalists for publishing stolen documents. 

Senator Ben Sasse thinks a more robust response is needed, not just blaming journalists or scolding dictators. He suggests a comprehensive strategy. Obama avoids directly saying Clinton lost because of Russia but thinks she wasn't treated fairly. Despite the issues, Obama wants a smooth transition for Trump's team. 

The press conference had an interruption when a journalist fainted, which adds a human element but isn't central to the summary. 

So, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Obama's concerns about Trump addressing Russian hacking, criticism of Republicans, intelligence confidence, Putin's involvement, consequences, criticism of GOP and journalists, and the transition. 

I should structure it clearly, making sure each main point is covered succinctly. Avoiding too much detail but ensuring all important aspects are included. Also, the user wants the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll make sure to format that correctly.
