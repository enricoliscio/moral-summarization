SUMMARY:
President Obama expressed his hope that President-elect Trump will show appropriate concern about Russian hacking into the U.S. election system, unlike many Republicans who were more worried about defeating Hillary Clinton than Moscow's alleged meddling. Obama believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to help Trump, and that the GOP was more interested in hurting Democrats than taking a stand against the autocratic Russian leader. The President also blasted Republican officials and GOP voters for expressing positive views of Putin, noting that 37% of Republican voters approve of the former head of the KGB. Obama warned that unless the partisan divides change, the U.S. will continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence. He also promised consequences for Russia's cyberattacks, which will increase the costs to Russia of future cyberattacks. END OF SUMMARY.
