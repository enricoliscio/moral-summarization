SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that his department has almost stopped the use of an unproven malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. While initially defending its use as a way to give hope to patients with few treatment options, Wilkie acknowledged that its application has been reduced as studies pointed to potential dangers and other possible treatments, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, became available. The VA's decision aligns with the guidance of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, who has urged caution on the drug.

According to data, prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged in mid-March, coinciding with President Trump's promotion of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, but have since tapered off amid growing scientific evidence of its ineffectiveness and potential side effects. Major veterans organizations had expressed concern over the VA's use of the drug, with an analysis showing no benefit and higher death rates among veterans who took it. The VA has maintained that the drug was prescribed only after a full discussion between doctor and patient about the risks involved. The department expects to continue limited use of hydroxychloroquine in clinical trials while prioritizing the safety and well-being of veterans under its care.
