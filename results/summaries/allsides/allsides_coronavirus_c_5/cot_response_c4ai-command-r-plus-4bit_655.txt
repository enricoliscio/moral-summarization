SUMMARY: 
Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the department has stopped the use of an unproven malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, on veterans with COVID-19. While initially justifying its use to give veterans *hope*, Wilkie acknowledged that its application has been *ratcheted down* as studies highlighted potential dangers and other treatments became available. This decision aligns with the *science* and the counsel of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert. The VA's *mission* is to *protect* life, and they are learning as they go in this crisis. 

The department has turned to remdesivir and convalescent plasma as potential treatments, with over 13,000 veterans infected and 1,200 deaths recorded. The VA faced criticism from veterans' organizations and lawmakers for its initial use of hydroxychloroquine, which was promoted by President Trump despite a lack of scientific evidence. Data revealed that prescriptions surged as Trump touted the drug, but have since tapered off. 

Wilkie defended the VA's actions, stating that they prescribed the drug only when medically appropriate and after full disclosure of risks. However, Rep. Nita Lowey urged the VA to heed the *science* of Fauci rather than the president's *wishful thinking*. The FDA has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of formal studies.
