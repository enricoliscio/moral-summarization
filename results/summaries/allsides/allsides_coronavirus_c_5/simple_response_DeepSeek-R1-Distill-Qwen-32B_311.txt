Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the underlying messages.

The article is about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans. They initially used it because there were few treatment options, giving patients hope. But as studies showed possible dangers, they reduced its use. President Trump was promoting the drug, but there's no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The VA is now using remdesivir and convalescent plasma instead. There were some negative outcomes from using hydroxychloroquine, with higher death rates in those who took it. The VA's data showed a surge in prescriptions when Trump started promoting it, but then it tapered off. They might continue using it in clinical trials, but some lawmakers criticized this decision.

Now, I need to capture the moral framing. The article highlights the tension between hope and scientific evidence. The VA's initial use was about giving hope, but they had to backtrack due to scientific concerns. The moral aspect is about responsible use of treatments, putting patients' lives first, and following scientific guidance over political influence.

I should structure the summary to include these points: VA stopping use, initial hope vs. scientific evidence, negative outcomes, shift to other treatments, criticism from lawmakers, and the importance of science over wishful thinking. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral elements are clear.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all the key points with the moral implications.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients, citing concerns over its safety and efficacy. Initially, the drug was used to provide hope during a time of limited treatment options, but studies raised safety concerns, leading to a sharp decline in prescriptions. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie emphasized the department's commitment to preserving life and aligning with scientific evidence. The VA has shifted to using remdesivir and convalescent plasma, which show promise in reducing recovery time. Hydroxychloroquine prescriptions surged in March after President Trump promoted its use, but they tapered off in April as criticism mounted. While the VA may continue using the drug in clinical trials, lawmakers like Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the delay in heeding expert warnings. The VA's decision reflects a balance between hope and science, prioritizing patient safety amid evolving scientific understanding. END OF SUMMARY.
