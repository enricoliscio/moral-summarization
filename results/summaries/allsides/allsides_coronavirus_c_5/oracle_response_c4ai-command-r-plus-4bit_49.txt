SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the department has stopped almost all use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, an unproven malaria drug heavily promoted by President Trump. While initially defending its use to give patients hope, Wilkie acknowledged that the VA has since "ratcheted it down" as studies pointed to potential dangers and other possible treatments, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, became available. Data showed that weekly prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged following Trump's endorsement but have since tapered off due to scientific counsel and analysis. Major veterans' organizations had called on the VA to explain its use of the drug, as an earlier analysis showed hundreds of veterans who took it saw no benefit and experienced higher death rates. The VA has emphasized that the drug was prescribed only after a full discussion of risks and benefits with patients and will continue to be used in limited contexts such as clinical trials. This shift in policy demonstrates the VA's commitment to protecting veterans' lives by responding to scientific guidance and prioritizing their care. 

END OF SUMMARY.
