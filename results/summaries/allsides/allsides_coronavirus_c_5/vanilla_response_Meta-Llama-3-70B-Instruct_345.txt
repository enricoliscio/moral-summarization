SUMMARY:

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. The drug was initially used due to limited treatment options, but studies have since shown possible dangers and other treatments have become available. Only three prescriptions were issued in the last week. The VA has turned to other treatments such as remdesivir, which has shown promise in reducing recovery time. The department has faced criticism for its use of hydroxychloroquine, with data showing no benefit for COVID-19 and a higher death rate among veterans who took the drug. Wilkie expects the VA to continue using the drug in limited forms, such as clinical trials, based on guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci.

END OF SUMMARY.
