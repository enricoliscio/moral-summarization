Okay, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans. They provided the article and an example of how the summary should look. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The main points are that the VA has almost stopped using hydroxychloroquine, which was initially used because there were few treatment options. Secretary Wilkie mentioned it was used to give hope. However, as studies showed possible dangers, the usage decreased. They've now moved to remdesivir and convalescent plasma. The article also mentions that about 1,370 veterans were prescribed the drug, with higher mortality rates in those who took it. There's criticism from Rep. Lowey about not following Dr. Fauci's advice from the start.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these key points. I need to structure it clearly, starting with the main action (VA stopping use), then the initial justification, the reasons for stopping, the alternative treatments, the data on prescriptions and mortality, and the criticism. Also, mention the FDA's stance on the drug.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward. Make sure to include the number of veterans infected and the death toll as well. 

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring each point is covered without being too wordy. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Also, make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY:  
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, with only three prescriptions in the last week. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug as a way to provide hope when few options were available. However, as studies highlighted potential risks and alternative treatments like remdesivir emerged, the VA scaled back its use. Hydroxychloroquine prescriptions surged in March and April after President Trump promoted the drug, but they tapered off amid criticism and concerns over its effectiveness and safety. The VA has now shifted to using remdesivir and convalescent plasma, with preliminary studies showing reduced recovery times. Data shows that 1,370 veterans were prescribed hydroxychloroquine, with 28% dying when combined with usual care, compared to 11% with routine care alone. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not following Dr. Anthony Fauci’s cautionary advice from the start. The FDA has warned against hydroxychloroquine’s use outside formal studies due to potential heart risks and lack of proven efficacy. The VA has reported 13,657 COVID-19 cases among veterans, with 1,200 deaths.  
END OF SUMMARY.
