SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped using hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat veterans with COVID-19. While defending the initial use of the drug due to limited treatment options, Wilkie acknowledged that its usage has decreased significantly as studies highlight potential dangers and other treatments like remdesivir and convalescent plasma are introduced. Prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine peaked in late March following President Trump's promotion of the drug but have since tapered off. The VA's data revealed that 1,370 veterans were prescribed the drug, with a higher death rate among those taking it compared to those receiving standard care. Wilkie expects limited future use of hydroxychloroquine in clinical trials, guided by Dr. Anthony Fauci's expertise. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding Fauci's earlier warnings about the drug, urging them to follow scientific evidence over wishful thinking. The FDA has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of formal studies due to potential serious side effects.
