Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed single words and then write a summary preserving those moral frames.

First, I'll read through the article to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "unproven," "hope," "dangers," "justified," "responsible," "caution," "wishful thinking," "science," "safe," "effective," and "medically appropriate" stand out. These terms imply judgments about the actions taken or the outcomes.

Next, I'll structure the summary. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the VA stopping the drug, the initial use for hope, the tapering off due to studies, the political push by Trump, the shift to remdesivir, the data showing no benefit, and the criticism from Rep. Lowey.

I'll make sure to include the morally framed words to preserve the author's perspective. I should also mention the VA's adherence to scientific guidance and the FDA's warnings. Ending with the number of prescriptions and the shift to safer treatments will wrap it up neatly.

Now, putting it all together, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, highlighting the VA's responsible approach despite political influence and the importance of following scientific evidence.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has nearly ceased using hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, for treating COVID-19 in veterans. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended its initial use as a way to "give hope" during a time of limited treatment options. However, as studies highlighted potential dangers and alternative treatments emerged, the VA significantly reduced its use, prescribing it to only three patients in the last week. President Trump's promotion of the drug without scientific evidence drew criticism, with Rep. Nita Lowey urging the VA to prioritize scientific guidance over "wishful thinking." VA data revealed that 28% of veterans receiving hydroxychloroquine died, compared to 11% who received standard care. The VA now focuses on remdesivir, a more effective treatment, and plans to use hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials, aligning with Dr. Anthony Fauci's recommendations. The FDA has warned against its use outside of formal studies due to serious side effects. The VA has prescribed hydroxychloroquine to 1,370 veterans, emphasizing its use only when "medically appropriate."
