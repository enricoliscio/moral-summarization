SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has almost entirely ceased its use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat veterans with COVID-19. While initially defending the decision to use the drug as a way to offer hope and treatment options to veterans, Wilkie acknowledged that its use has significantly declined as studies highlight potential dangers and other treatments, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, have become available. The VA's shift in treatment strategy is a responsible and ethical decision, prioritizing the safety and well-being of veterans over unproven treatments.

This decision is a step in the right direction and aligns with the guidance provided by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, who has urged caution regarding hydroxychloroquine. Representative Nita Lowey also emphasized the importance of following scientific evidence and expert advice rather than wishful thinking. The VA's recent approach demonstrates a commitment to ethical and evidence-based practices, ensuring that veterans receive the best possible care while also protecting them from unnecessary risks. The VA's actions set a moral standard for medical decision-making during the COVID-19 crisis, prioritizing scientific evidence, veteran welfare, and transparency in treatment options.

END OF SUMMARY.
