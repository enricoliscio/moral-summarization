SUMMARY:

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. Despite initial use, studies have shown possible dangers and ineffectiveness, prompting the VA to "ratchet down" prescriptions to just three in the last week. Wilkie defended the initial use, saying it was meant to "give them hope" when treatment options were limited. However, he acknowledged that the VA's mission is to "preserve and protect life," and they are now turning to more promising treatments like remdesivir. The move comes after major veterans organizations and lawmakers criticized the VA's use of hydroxychloroquine, citing a lack of scientific evidence and potential harm. The moral takeaway is that medical decisions should be guided by scientific evidence and caution, rather than "wishful thinking" or political pressure.
