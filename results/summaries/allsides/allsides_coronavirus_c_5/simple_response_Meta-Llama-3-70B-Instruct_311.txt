SUMMARY:

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has nearly stopped using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans, citing studies that show possible dangers and ineffectiveness. Initially, the VA used the drug to "give hope" to patients with few treatment options, but has since "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week. This decision is a moral imperative, as the VA's mission is to "preserve and protect life." The department has turned to other treatments, such as remdesivir, which have shown promise in reducing recovery time. The VA's decision is a stark contrast to President Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine without scientific evidence, and is a testament to the importance of listening to scientific experts, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, rather than "wishful thinking." The VA's actions prioritize the well-being and safety of veterans, and serve as a model for responsible decision-making in the face of uncertainty.
