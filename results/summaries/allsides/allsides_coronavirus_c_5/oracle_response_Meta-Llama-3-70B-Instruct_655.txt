SUMMARY: 

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has significantly reduced its use of the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing studies that pointed to possible dangers. Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified "to give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, he acknowledged that the VA's mission is to "preserve and protect life," and that the department has been turning to alternative treatments like remdesivir, which have shown promise in reducing recovery time. Major veterans organizations had called for the VA to explain its use of hydroxychloroquine, which was found to have no benefit for COVID-19 in an analysis of VA hospital data. The VA's guidance on the drug will continue to be informed by the counsel of Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has urged caution on its use. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not listening to Fauci's guidance from the start, saying the department should respond to the science rather than "wishful thinking" coming from the president.
