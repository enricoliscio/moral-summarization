Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that VA Secretary Robert Wilkie announced they've almost stopped using hydroxychloroquine. He defended its initial use as giving hope when there were few options. But as studies showed possible dangers, they reduced its use to just three prescriptions last week. President Trump had been promoting the drug without evidence.

I should note the moral aspects here. The VA's decision seems driven by both patient outcomes and scientific evidence. The initial use was about hope, which is a positive intent, but they had to change course when evidence showed risks.

The article also mentions that 28% of veterans on hydroxychloroquine died compared to 11% without it. That's a significant moral issueâ€”using a drug that might be harmful. The VA shifted to remdesivir and convalescent plasma, which seems more responsible.

There's criticism from Rep. Lowey about the VA not following Fauci's advice from the start, implying a failure in prioritizing scientific caution over political influence. The FDA warnings and limited studies on hydroxychloroquine's safety add to the moral dilemma.

I need to make sure the summary includes these points: the reduction in hydroxychloroquine use, the initial justification, the negative outcomes, the shift to other treatments, and the criticism about not following scientific advice earlier. Also, the moral framing involves balancing hope with scientific responsibility and the impact on patient outcomes.

I should structure the summary to highlight the VA's initial decision, the negative data, the shift in treatment, and the criticism. Keeping it under 200 words, so I need to be concise but include all key moral points.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment in veterans, citing concerns over its safety and efficacy. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the drug's initial use as a "hopeful" measure when few options were available, but emphasized that its use has been scaled back as studies highlighted potential dangers. VA hospitals now prescribe hydroxychloroquine in only three cases weekly, favoring remdesivir and convalescent plasma instead. Critics, including Rep. Nita Lowey, argue the VA should have followed scientific caution from the start, as data showed higher mortality rates for veterans on hydroxychloroquine. The VA plans to limit future use to clinical trials, aligning with guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci. The decision reflects a shift from political promotion to science-based treatment, as hydroxychloroquine remains unproven and carries risks. END OF SUMMARY.
