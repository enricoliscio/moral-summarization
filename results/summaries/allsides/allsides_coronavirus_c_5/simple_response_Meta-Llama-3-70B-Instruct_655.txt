SUMMARY:

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has largely stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans, citing possible dangers and lack of scientific evidence. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was meant to "give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, as studies revealed potential risks and other treatments emerged, the VA significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine. The department has turned to alternative treatments, such as remdesivir, which have shown promise in reducing recovery time. The VA's decision is a welcome move, as major veterans organizations had called for an explanation of the drug's use after an analysis showed it provided no benefit for COVID-19 patients. The episode highlights the importance of prioritizing scientific evidence over wishful thinking, as emphasized by Rep. Nita Lowey.
