Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans. The article mentions that Secretary Wilkie defended the initial use as giving hope, but then they scaled back because studies showed possible dangers. Trump was promoting the drug without evidence. The VA is now using remdesivir and convalescent plasma. There's data showing higher death rates with hydroxychloroquine. The VA's use of the drug peaked when Trump was promoting it, but they've since reduced it. Wilkie says they'll continue using it in clinical trials, but a congresswoman criticized them for not following Fauci's advice from the start. The FDA has warned against the drug, and the VA says they only used it when medically appropriate after discussing risks with patients.

Now, I need to summarize this in 200 words or less, preserving the moral framing. The moral aspects include the VA's responsibility to protect lives, the conflict between Trump's promotion and scientific evidence, the criticism of not following expert advice, and the ethical use of drugs based on evidence.

I'll start by stating that the VA is stopping most use of hydroxychloroquine. Mention Wilkie's defense of initial use for hope, then scaling back due to studies and new treatments. Note Trump's promotion despite lack of evidence. Include the higher death rates from the drug. Mention the peak prescriptions when Trump was promoting it, then reduction. Note that they'll continue using it in trials, but Congress criticized them for not following Fauci earlier. Highlight the FDA's warnings and the VA's claim of only using it when appropriate after discussing risks.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without going over the word limit. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral aspect is included concisely.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, as studies indicated potential risks and more effective treatments emerged. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, stating it provided hope when few options were available. However, prescriptions dropped to just three in the last week, aligning with scientific concerns and the emergence of remdesivir and convalescent plasma as safer alternatives. Despite President Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine, the VA heeded warnings from the Food and Drug Administration and scientific evidence showing no proven efficacy. Data revealed higher death rates among veterans using hydroxychloroquine, leading to criticism for not following expert advice earlier. The VA plans to continue using the drug only in clinical trials, emphasizing a commitment to evidence-based treatment. END OF SUMMARY.
