SUMMARY:
The Veterans Affairs (VA) department has almost stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing possible dangers and lack of scientific evidence of its effectiveness. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified "to give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, as studies pointed to potential risks, the VA has "ratcheted down" its use, with only three prescriptions in the last week. The department has turned to other treatments, such as remdesivir, which have shown promising results. Wilkie acknowledged that the VA's mission is to "preserve and protect life," and that they are "learning as they go" in this crisis. The decision comes after major veterans organizations called for an explanation of the VA's use of hydroxychloroquine, which has been linked to serious side effects. END OF SUMMARY.
