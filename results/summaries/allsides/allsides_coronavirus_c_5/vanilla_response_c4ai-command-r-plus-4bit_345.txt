SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans, following concerns about its safety and effectiveness. Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, citing a lack of treatment options at the time, but acknowledged that prescriptions have decreased significantly in recent weeks. Data showed that weekly prescriptions surged in mid-March, coinciding with President Trump's promotion of the drug, but have since tapered off. 

The VA's decision comes after an analysis of VA hospital data revealed that veterans who took hydroxychloroquine saw no benefit for COVID-19, with a higher death rate among those taking the drug. The department is now turning to other treatments, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, and expects to continue this trend. 

While Wilkie suggested limited use of hydroxychloroquine in clinical trials, Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding the warnings of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, about the drug's potential dangers. No rigorous studies have proven the drug's safety or effectiveness for COVID-19, and it carries serious side effects. 

END OF SUMMARY.
