SUMMARY: 
Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA would stop using hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. While initially defending the use of the drug to give veterans *hope*, Wilkie acknowledged that its use has been "ratcheted down" in recent weeks. This decision comes in response to studies highlighting potential dangers and the emergence of other possible treatments, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma. 

The VA's decision follows criticism from major veterans organizations and an analysis of VA hospital data, which showed that veterans treated with hydroxychloroquine experienced higher death rates. Despite the lack of scientific evidence and warnings from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the VA prescribed the drug to 1,370 veterans, peaking at 404 prescriptions in a single week in March. 

The VA has a *mission* to *protect* and *preserve* life, and Wilkie emphasized that their decisions are made with the veterans' well-being in mind. Moving forward, the VA will continue to listen to scientific counsel and exercise *caution* when deciding on treatment options. 

END OF SUMMARY.
