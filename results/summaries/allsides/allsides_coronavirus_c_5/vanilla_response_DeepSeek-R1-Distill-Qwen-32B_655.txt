Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that VA Secretary Robert Wilkie announced they've almost stopped using hydroxychloroquine. He defended its initial use as giving hope when there were few options. Now, they've reduced prescriptions to just three in the last week, citing studies showing possible dangers and other treatments becoming available.

President Trump has been promoting the drug without evidence, and Wilkie mentioned they're all learning during the crisis. The VA is now using remdesivir and convalescent plasma. They've had over 13,000 cases and 1,200 deaths among veterans.

Veterans organizations were concerned after data showed no benefit and higher death rates for those taking the drug. Prescriptions peaked around 404 in late March when Trump was promoting it, then dropped in April. The VA expects to use hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials, following Dr. Fauci's guidance. Rep. Lowey criticized the VA for not listening to Fauci earlier. The FDA warns against using the drug outside of studies, and the VA says it was only used when appropriate after discussing risks with patients.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: VA stopping hydroxychloroquine, initial use for hope, reduction due to studies and side effects, shift to remdesivir, high death rates, peak prescriptions, criticism, and current limited use in trials. I'll make sure to mention Trump's promotion and the FDA's stance.

Let me structure it: Start with the announcement, reasons for stopping, mention Trump's influence, shift to other treatments, statistics, criticism, and current cautious use. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, with only three prescriptions in the last week. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug as a way to provide hope when few treatment options were available. However, as studies highlighted potential dangers and alternative treatments like remdesivir emerged, the VA scaled back its use. President Trump had promoted the drug despite a lack of scientific evidence. The VA has shifted to using remdesivir and convalescent plasma, with preliminary studies showing reduced recovery times. Over 13,657 veterans have been infected with COVID-19, and 1,200 have died. Data showed no significant benefit from hydroxychloroquine, with higher death rates among those who received it. Weekly prescriptions peaked at 404 in late March before declining in April. The VA plans to use hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials, following guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding Fauci's warnings earlier. The FDA has cautioned against the drug's use outside of formal studies, emphasizing its potential risks. END OF SUMMARY.
