SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped using hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat COVID-19 patients. This decision comes after initial use of the drug to provide hope and explore treatment options, but studies have since indicated potential dangers. The VA has shifted to other treatments like remdesivir and convalescent plasma, with only three prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the last week. 

The VA faced criticism for its initial use of the drug, with data showing that 28% of veterans who took hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, compared to 11% with usual care alone. Weekly prescriptions surged to a peak of 404 in late March as Trump promoted its use, but have since tapered off. 

Wilkie defended the VA's actions, stating they were learning as they went in the crisis and their mission is to preserve and protect lives. He also stated that the VA will continue limited use of the drug in clinical trials, following the guidance of Dr. Anthony Fauci. Rep. Nita Lowey rebuked Wilkie, stating the VA should have listened to Fauci's initial caution on the drug. The FDA has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of formal studies. 

As of now, 13,657 veterans have been infected with COVID-19, with 1,200 deaths, according to the VA website.
END OF SUMMARY.
