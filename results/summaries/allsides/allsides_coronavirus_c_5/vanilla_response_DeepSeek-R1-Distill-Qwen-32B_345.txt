Alright, I need to summarize this article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that VA Secretary Robert Wilkie stated they've almost stopped using hydroxychloroquine. Initially, they used it to give hope when there were few options. But as studies showed possible dangers, they reduced its use, down to just three prescriptions last week. They're now using remdesivir and convalescent plasma instead.

President Trump was promoting the drug, even taking it himself without evidence. The VA's data shows that 1,370 veterans were prescribed hydroxychloroquine, with 28% dying when combined with usual care, compared to 11% with routine care alone. Weekly prescriptions spiked in March when Trump started promoting it but tapered off in April after backlash.

Wilkie says they'll continue using the drug in clinical trials, following Dr. Fauci's guidance. Rep. Lowey criticized the VA for not listening to Fauci earlier. The FDA warns against using hydroxychloroquine except in studies, and the VA only used it when appropriate after discussing risks with patients.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll include the main points: VA stopping use, initial use for hope, reduction due to studies, switch to remdesivir, Trump's promotion, data showing higher mortality, peak prescriptions, tapering off, clinical trials, criticism, FDA warnings, and VA's cautious approach.

Let me structure this into a clear, concise summary, making sure each key point is included without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, with only three prescriptions in the last week. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug as a way to provide hope when few treatment options were available. However, as studies highlighted potential risks and alternative treatments like remdesivir emerged, the VA scaled back its use. President Trump had strongly endorsed the drug, even taking it himself, though no large studies have proven its effectiveness or safety for COVID-19. VA data showed that 1,370 veterans were prescribed hydroxychloroquine, with a higher mortality rate among those who received it alongside usual care (28%) compared to routine care alone (11%). Weekly prescriptions peaked in March when Trump began promoting the drug but declined in April amid criticism and the emergence of remdesivir. Wilkie stated the VA would continue using hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials, following guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding Fauci's caution earlier. The FDA has warned against using hydroxychloroquine outside of formal studies due to potential side effects. The VA emphasized that the drug was prescribed only when medically appropriate after discussing risks with patients. END OF SUMMARY.
