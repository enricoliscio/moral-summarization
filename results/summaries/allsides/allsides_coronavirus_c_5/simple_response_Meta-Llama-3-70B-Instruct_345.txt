SUMMARY:

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has largely stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans, citing possible dangers and lack of scientific evidence. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was meant "to give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, as studies revealed potential risks and other treatments became available, the VA reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine. The department is now turning to proven treatments like remdesivir. The VA's decision comes after major veterans organizations called for an explanation of its use of hydroxychloroquine, which was shown to have no benefit for COVID-19 and increased mortality rates. The moral imperative to "preserve and protect life" should guide medical decisions, rather than "wishful thinking" or political influence.
