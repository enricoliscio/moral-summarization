Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. They also provided a list of morally framed words that should be included if possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The VA initially used hydroxychloroquine because there were few treatment options, giving patients hope. But as studies showed possible dangers, they reduced its use. President Trump promoted the drug, but the VA is now moving towards remdesivir and convalescent plasma. They've stopped almost all use, except for clinical trials. Some organizations criticized the VA for not explaining the drug's use, and the data showed higher death rates among those taking it. The VA's mission is to preserve and protect life, and they're now following scientific guidance.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally framed words: use, pointed, preserve, protect, study, analysis, care, routine, guidance, counsel, science, coming, wishful, studies, warned. 

I'll start by stating that the VA has almost stopped using hydroxychloroquine. I'll mention that they initially used it to give hope, but studies pointed to dangers. Then, I'll note the reduction in prescriptions and the shift to remdesivir and plasma. I'll include that the mission is to preserve and protect life, and they're following scientific guidance. I'll also mention the criticism and the data showing higher death rates. Finally, I'll note that the VA is now using the drug only in limited cases, like clinical trials, based on Dr. Fauci's guidance, and the FDA's warnings.

I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral words are included. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has nearly ceased using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment in veterans, citing studies pointing to potential dangers. Initially, the drug was used to give hope amid limited treatment options, but its use has been significantly reduced, with only three prescriptions in the last week. The VA is now focusing on remdesivir and convalescent plasma, aligning with scientific guidance. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie emphasized the department's mission to preserve and protect life, acknowledging the need to adapt as new evidence emerges. Critics, including Rep. Nita Lowey, urged the VA to prioritize scientific counsel over wishful thinking. The VA has warned against the drug's use outside formal studies, as no rigorous studies have proven its safety or efficacy for COVID-19. The department has prescribed hydroxychloroquine to 1,370 veterans, with data showing higher mortality rates among those treated with the drug. Moving forward, the VA plans to use hydroxychloroquine only in limited clinical trial settings, guided by experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci. END OF SUMMARY.
