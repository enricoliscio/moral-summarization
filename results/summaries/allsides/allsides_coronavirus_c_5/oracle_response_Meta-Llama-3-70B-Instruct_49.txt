SUMMARY:

The Veterans Affairs (VA) department has significantly reduced its use of the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing possible dangers and the availability of other treatments. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified "to give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, he acknowledged that the department has "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week, as studies pointed to possible dangers. The VA's mission is to "preserve and protect life," and it has been turning to alternative treatments such as remdesivir, which has shown reduced recovery time. The department's decision comes after major veterans organizations called for an explanation of its use of hydroxychloroquine, citing an analysis that showed hundreds of veterans who took the drug saw no benefit for COVID-19. Rep. Nita Lowey urged the VA to listen to the science and guidance of Dr. Anthony Fauci, rather than "wishful thinking" coming from the president.
