SUMMARY:
The Veterans Affairs (VA) department has significantly reduced its use of the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing possible dangers and lack of scientific evidence. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified "to give them hope" when treatment options were limited. However, as studies pointed to potential risks and other treatments emerged, the VA "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week. Wilkie expects this trend to continue, prioritizing the VA's mission "to preserve and protect life." The department is now turning to more promising treatments like remdesivir, which has shown reduced recovery time. The VA's decision comes after major veterans organizations called for an explanation of its use of hydroxychloroquine, citing a lack of benefit and potential harm. END OF SUMMARY.
