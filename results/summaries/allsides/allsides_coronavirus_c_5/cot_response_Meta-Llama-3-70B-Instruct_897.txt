SUMMARY:
The Veterans Affairs (VA) department has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, on veterans with COVID-19, citing possible dangers and lack of scientific evidence. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified "to give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, as studies pointed to potential risks, the VA "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week. The department has shifted its focus to remdesivir and convalescent plasma, which have shown promise in reducing recovery time. Major veterans organizations had called for the VA to explain its use of hydroxychloroquine after an analysis showed hundreds of veterans saw no benefit. The VA's decision to limit the drug's use is a step towards preserving and protecting life, and listening to the science and caution urged by Dr. Anthony Fauci. END OF SUMMARY.
