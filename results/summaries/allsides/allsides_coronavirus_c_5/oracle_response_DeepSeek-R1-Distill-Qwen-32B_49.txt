Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words, and I should make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary. The summary should be under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The VA has mostly stopped using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans because studies showed possible dangers. They initially used it to give hope, but as more information came out, they reduced its use. President Trump was promoting it, but there's no strong scientific evidence. The VA is now using remdesivir and convalescent plasma instead. They've prescribed hydroxychloroquine to 1,370 veterans, but with significant risks. The VA is now using it only in clinical trials, following Dr. Fauci's guidance, but some in Congress are criticizing them for not following his advice earlier.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the author's list that fit into the summary. The words are: use, pointed, preserve, protect, study, analysis, care, routine, guidance, counsel, science, coming, wishful, studies, warned.

I'll structure the summary to include these words. I'll start by stating the VA has stopped using hydroxychloroquine, mentioning the studies and analysis that pointed out dangers. I'll note the initial use to preserve and protect lives, giving hope. Then, the reduction in use as more science came in. Mention President Trump's promotion without evidence, and the VA moving to remdesivir and plasma. Include the data on prescriptions and deaths, the criticism from veterans groups, and the shift to using the drug only in trials with Fauci's guidance. Also, mention the FDA warnings and the VA's commitment to science over wishful thinking.

I'll make sure the summary flows naturally while incorporating the moral words. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words. Let me draft this out, ensuring each point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has nearly halted the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans, citing studies and analysis that pointed to potential dangers. Initially, the drug was used to preserve and protect lives, offering hope during a time of limited treatment options. However, as scientific evidence emerged, the VA significantly reduced its use, with only three prescriptions in the last week. President Trump's promotion of the drug without rigorous studies contrasted with the VA's pivot to remdesivir and convalescent plasma, which showed promise in reducing recovery times. The VA, the nation's largest hospital system, reported 13,657 COVID-19 cases and 1,200 deaths among veterans. Data revealed that 28% of those treated with hydroxychloroquine died, compared to 11% with routine care alone. The VA now plans to use hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials, guided by Dr. Anthony Fauci's counsel, though some critics argue it should have followed his advice from the start. The FDA has warned against the drug's use outside formal studies due to risks like heart rhythm problems. The VA emphasizes adhering to science over wishful thinking, aligning its practices with emerging evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
