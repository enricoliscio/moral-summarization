SUMMARY:

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has largely stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans. The decision comes after studies showed possible dangers and other treatments became available. Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified to give patients hope when few treatment options existed. However, he acknowledged that the VA has "ratcheted down" its use of the drug, with only three prescriptions in the last week. The VA is now turning to other treatments, such as remdesivir, which has shown promise in reducing recovery time. The move comes after criticism from major veterans organizations and lawmakers, who pointed to the lack of scientific evidence supporting the drug's effectiveness.

END OF SUMMARY.
