SUMMARY:

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified to give patients hope when few treatment options were available. However, as studies revealed possible dangers and other treatments emerged, the VA "ratcheted down" its use of hydroxychloroquine, with only three prescriptions in the last week. The VA is now turning to more promising treatments like remdesivir. The decision comes after major veterans organizations called for an explanation of the VA's use of hydroxychloroquine, citing an analysis that showed no benefit for COVID-19 patients and a higher death rate among those who took the drug. The VA's move is a step towards prioritizing evidence-based medicine and protecting the lives of veterans.
