SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has nearly stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing studies that pointed to possible dangers. Initially, the VA used the drug to "give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, as studies emerged, the VA "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week. Wilkie emphasized that the VA's mission is to "preserve and protect life." The department has turned to alternative treatments, such as remdesivir, which has shown reduced recovery time. Major veterans organizations had called for the VA to explain its use of hydroxychloroquine after an analysis showed hundreds of veterans saw no benefit. Rep. Nita Lowey rebuked the VA, urging them to respond to the science and guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci, rather than "wishful thinking" from the president. The VA will continue to use the drug in limited forms, such as clinical trials, based on Fauci's counsel. END OF SUMMARY.
