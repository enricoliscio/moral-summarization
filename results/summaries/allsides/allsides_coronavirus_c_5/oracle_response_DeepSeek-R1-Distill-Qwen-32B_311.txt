Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the VA's decision to stop using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans, except in clinical trials, after studies showed potential dangers. They initially used it to give hope but have now reduced its use based on scientific evidence.

I should identify the morally framed words: use, pointed, preserve, protect, study, analysis, care, routine, guidance, counsel, science, coming, wishful, studies, warned. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by mentioning the VA stopping almost all use of the drug. Then, note the initial justification as giving hope. Highlight the reduction based on studies and other treatments. Mention Trump's promotion versus scientific evidence. Include the data showing higher mortality with hydroxychloroquine. Reference the shift to remdesivir and convalescent plasma. Note the VA's plan to continue limited use in trials, guided by Dr. Fauci. Also, include Rep. Lowey's criticism about following science instead of wishful thinking. Finally, mention the FDA's warning and the VA's stance on prescribing only when appropriate after discussions.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring all key points are covered concisely. I'll make sure to incorporate the moral terms where appropriate to maintain the author's framing.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, citing studies that pointed to potential dangers and the emergence of other treatments like remdesivir. Initially, the VA used the drug to give hope during a time of limited options, but as evidence of its risks grew, prescriptions dropped to just three in the last week. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie emphasized the department's mission to preserve and protect life, aligning with scientific guidance, particularly from Dr. Anthony Fauci. However, Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not following Fauci's counsel from the start, urging reliance on science rather than "wishful thinking." The VA's data revealed that 28% of veterans receiving hydroxychloroquine died, compared to 11% with routine care alone. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the drug's use outside of formal studies due to its risks, including heart rhythm problems. The VA now plans to continue using hydroxychloroquine only in limited, medically appropriate cases, such as clinical trials. END OF SUMMARY.
