SUMMARY:
Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the department has nearly stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing a lack of scientific evidence of its effectiveness. Initially, the VA had used the drug "to give them hope" when treatment options were limited, but as studies pointed to possible dangers, they "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week. The VA's mission "to preserve and protect life" led them to turn to other treatments like remdesivir, which has shown promising results. Wilkie defended the initial use of hydroxychloroquine, but Rep. Nita Lowey rebuked him, urging the VA to listen to the science and caution from Dr. Anthony Fauci rather than "wishful thinking" from the president. The VA has prescribed the drug only when medically appropriate, but its use has been widely criticized. END OF SUMMARY.
