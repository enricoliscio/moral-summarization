SUMMARY:
Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the department has stopped using an unproven malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, on veterans with COVID-19. While initially justified as offering hope to patients with few treatment options, the VA has since "ratcheted down" its use, with just three prescriptions in the last week. This decision is based on scientific studies highlighting potential dangers and the emergence of other possible treatments, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma. 

The VA's use of hydroxychloroquine came under scrutiny from veterans' organizations and lawmakers, with data revealing a higher death rate among those prescribed the drug. Weekly prescriptions surged following President Trump's promotion of the drug but have since tapered off. 

Wilkie defended the VA's actions, stating that they are learning as they go in this crisis and that their mission is to protect and preserve life. He expects the VA to continue using hydroxychloroquine in limited forms, such as clinical trials, guided by scientific counsel. 

This decision underscores the importance of prioritizing scientific evidence and hope over wishful thinking, especially during a crisis that impacts the lives of vulnerable veterans.
