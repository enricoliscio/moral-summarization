SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans, with only three prescriptions in the last week. This decision comes after studies highlighted potential dangers and other treatment options, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, became available. 

While initially defending the use of the drug, Wilkie acknowledged that the VA's mission is to preserve and protect lives, and that they are learning as they go in this crisis. Data showed that prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged in mid-March, coinciding with President Trump's promotion of the drug, before tapering off in late April following backlash and the emergence of alternative treatments. 

About 1,370 veterans were prescribed hydroxychloroquine, and an analysis found that 28% of those taking the drug plus usual care died, compared to 11% receiving routine care alone. Wilkie stated that the VA will continue limited use of hydroxychloroquine in clinical trials, guided by Dr. Anthony Fauci's expertise. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding Fauci's initial caution regarding the drug, urging them to follow scientific evidence over wishful thinking. 

The FDA has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of formal studies, and the VA maintains that the drug was prescribed only when medically appropriate, with full disclosure of risks.
