Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that VA Secretary Robert Wilkie announced they've almost stopped using the drug. He defended its initial use as giving hope when there were few options, but now they've reduced prescriptions to just three in the last week. Studies showed possible dangers, and other treatments like remdesivir are being used instead. President Trump was promoting the drug without evidence, which might have influenced its initial use.

The article also notes that the VA is the largest hospital system and has had 13,657 COVID-19 cases with 1,200 deaths. Veterans organizations were concerned after data showed no benefit, with higher death rates among those taking hydroxychloroquine. The prescriptions peaked at 404 weekly after Trump's promotion but then dropped as remdesivir became available.

Wilkie mentioned they might continue using the drug in clinical trials, following Dr. Fauci's guidance. Rep. Lowey criticized the VA for not listening to Fauci earlier. The FDA warns against using hydroxychloroquine except in studies, and the VA says it was only used when appropriate after discussing risks with patients.

So, the main points are:
- VA stopped using hydroxychloroquine due to lack of evidence and safety concerns.
- Initial use was to provide hope, but studies showed risks.
- Shift to remdesivir and other treatments.
- High number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among veterans.
- Criticism from organizations and Congress for using the drug despite negative data.
- Possible continued use in clinical trials with expert guidance.
- FDA warnings and VA's stance on appropriate use.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these points concisely. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the announcement, reasons for stopping, data showing ineffectiveness, criticism, alternative treatments, and future plans.

I should also mention the VA's size and the impact on veterans, as well as the political aspect with Trump promoting the drug. It's important to highlight the shift in treatment and the scientific backing behind it.

Let me make sure not to miss any critical details. The summary should cover the VA's decision, the initial use, the data showing no benefit, the peak in prescriptions influenced by Trump, the shift to remdesivir, criticism from Fauci and Congress, and the FDA's stance.

I think that's all the essential information. Now, I'll put it together in a coherent, concise manner, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, citing lack of evidence and safety concerns. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the drug's initial use as providing hope during a time of limited treatment options but stated that prescriptions have dropped to just three in the last week. Studies indicated potential dangers, and the VA has shifted to using remdesivir, which shows promise in reducing recovery time. President Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine, despite no scientific backing, coincided with a surge in prescriptions, peaking at 404 weekly. However, data revealed no benefit, with higher death rates among those taking the drug. Critics, including Rep. Nita Lowey, criticized the VA for not heeding expert warnings earlier. The VA plans to continue using hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials, following guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci. The FDA warns against its use outside formal studies, and the VA emphasizes appropriate medical discussions before prescribing. END OF SUMMARY.
