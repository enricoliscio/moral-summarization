SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped almost all use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, on veterans with COVID-19. While initially defending the use of the drug to give hope to patients with few treatment options, Wilkie acknowledged that its use has been reduced as studies pointed to possible dangers and other potential treatments, such as remdesivir, became available. The VA's decision aligns with the guidance of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, who cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine without scientific evidence of its effectiveness. 

Data from VA hospitals revealed that about 28% of veterans who took hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, compared to 11% who received routine care alone. Weekly prescriptions for the drug peaked in mid-March as President Trump promoted its use, but have since tapered off amid increasing scientific evidence of its potential harms. 

The VA emphasizes that its mission is to preserve and protect the lives of veterans, and it will continue to make treatment decisions based on scientific studies and analysis, prioritizing the care and well-being of its patients.
