Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible in the summary without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The VA stopped using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans because studies showed possible dangers, and they're now using remdesivir. The secretary, Robert Wilkie, defended the initial use as giving hope but then reduced it. President Trump promoted the drug despite lack of evidence. The VA's data showed higher death rates with the drug, leading to its reduced use. They plan to continue limited use in clinical trials, but a congresswoman criticized this decision.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the author's list: use, pointed, preserve, protect, study, analysis, care, routine, guidance, counsel, science, coming, wishful, studies, warned.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. For example, "pointed" can be used when referring to studies showing dangers. "Preserve and protect" relates to the VA's mission. "Study" and "analysis" are key when discussing the data. "Care" and "routine" describe the treatment approach. "Guidance" and "counsel" relate to Dr. Fauci's advice. "Science" and "wishful thinking" contrast the evidence-based approach versus Trump's promotion. "Warned" ties into the FDA's stance.

I'll start the summary by stating the VA has stopped using the drug, referencing the studies pointing to dangers. Mention the initial use to give hope, then the reduction. Include the mission to preserve and protect life. Note the shift to remdesivir and the data showing higher death rates. Then, discuss the limited continued use in trials, the criticism from the congresswoman, and the lack of rigorous studies supporting the drug. Finally, mention the FDA's warning and the VA's commitment to science over wishful thinking.

I need to keep it concise, around 200 words, ensuring all key points are covered while incorporating the moral framing words. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each point flows logically and the moral terms are appropriately placed.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans, as studies pointed to potential dangers and other treatments emerged. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use as a way to "give them hope" but emphasized the VA's mission to "preserve and protect life." Weekly prescriptions dropped from 404 in late March to just three by late April, aligning with scientific guidance. The VA is now focusing on remdesivir, which preliminary studies suggest reduces recovery time. VA data revealed that 28% of veterans receiving hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, compared to 11% with routine care alone. Wilkie stated the VA will continue limited use in clinical trials, guided by Dr. Anthony Fauci's counsel. However, Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not prioritizing scientific evidence from the start. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against hydroxychloroquine's use outside formal studies, as no large studies have proven its safety or efficacy for COVID-19. The VA has emphasized using the drug only when medically appropriate, after discussing risks with patients. END OF SUMMARY.
