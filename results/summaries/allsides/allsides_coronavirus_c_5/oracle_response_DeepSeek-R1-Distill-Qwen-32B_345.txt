Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words that the author used. The article is about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19. The author used words like "use," "pointed," "preserve," "protect," "study," "analysis," "care," "routine," "guidance," "counsel," "science," "coming," "wishful," "studies," and "warned." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The VA initially used hydroxychloroquine because there were few treatment options, giving veterans hope. But as studies showed possible dangers, they reduced its use. President Trump promoted the drug without evidence. The VA now uses remdesivir and convalescent plasma. Data showed higher death rates with hydroxychloroquine. Weekly prescriptions peaked when Trump started promoting it. VA expects to use it only in clinical trials, following Dr. Fauci's guidance. Rep. Lowey criticized the VA for not listening to Fauci earlier. The FDA warned against using the drug outside of studies, and the VA says it was used only when medically appropriate after discussing risks with patients.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, using as many of the moral framing words as possible. I'll start by stating that the VA has all but stopped using hydroxychloroquine. Mention the initial use to give hope, then the studies pointing to dangers. Include the reduction to three prescriptions. Note Trump's promotion without evidence. Transition to using remdesivir and plasma. Highlight the VA data showing higher death rates. Mention the peak prescriptions when Trump promoted it. Note the expectation to use it only in trials, guided by Fauci. Rep. Lowey's criticism about following science. FDA warning and VA's stance on using it only when appropriate after discussing risks.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all key points with the moral words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, citing studies that pointed to potential dangers. Initially, the drug was used to give veterans hope during a time of limited treatment options. However, as evidence emerged, prescriptions dropped to just three in the last week. President Trump's promotion of the drug without scientific backing contrasted with the VA's shift toward remdesivir and convalescent plasma. Data revealed higher death rates among veterans using hydroxychloroquine, and prescriptions peaked when Trump began advocating for it. The VA now plans to use the drug only in clinical trials, following Dr. Anthony Fauci's guidance. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not adhering to Fauci's counsel earlier, emphasizing the need to follow science. The FDA has warned against using hydroxychloroquine outside of studies, and the VA assures it was prescribed only when medically appropriate after discussing risks with patients. END OF SUMMARY.
