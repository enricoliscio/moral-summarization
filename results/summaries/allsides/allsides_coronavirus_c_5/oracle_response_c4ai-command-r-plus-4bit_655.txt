SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the department has stopped almost all use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, on veterans with COVID-19. While initially defending its use as a way to give patients hope, Wilkie acknowledged that the government-run VA hospitals have since reduced its prescription, with only three in the last week. This decision comes as studies point to possible dangers and other potential treatments, such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, are being explored. The VA's mission is to preserve and protect the lives of veterans, and they aim to continue following the guidance of scientific experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci.

According to data, 1,370 veterans were prescribed hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, and the drug was only used when medically appropriate after a full discussion between doctors and patients about the risks involved. However, an analysis of VA hospital data showed that 28% of veterans who took the drug did not experience any benefits, and major veterans organizations have called on the VA to explain its use. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding the counsel of Dr. Fauci earlier, who had urged caution on the drug. The department is expected to continue using hydroxychloroquine in limited forms, such as clinical trials, while prioritizing the safety and well-being of veterans above all else.
