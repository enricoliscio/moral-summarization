Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19. 

First, the main points I see are that Robert Wilkie, the VA Secretary, announced they've almost stopped using the drug. He mentioned they initially used it to give hope, but studies showed possible dangers. They're now using remdesivir instead. The article also mentions that President Trump was promoting the drug without evidence. 

I should note that the VA had 13,657 COVID cases with 1,200 deaths. The data shows that hydroxychloroquine didn't help much, with higher death rates in those who took it. The prescriptions peaked at 404 in mid-March and then tapered off. They might still use it in clinical trials, but some congress members are critical. 

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: VA stopping hydroxychloroquine, initial use for hope, studies showing risks, shift to remdesivir, Trump's promotion, data on effectiveness, and the VA's future plans. Also, include the number of prescriptions and the criticism from Rep. Lowey. 

I'll structure it to start with the VA's decision, then why they started using it, the reasons for stopping, the shift to other treatments, the political angle with Trump, the statistics, and the criticism. 

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be concise but cover all main points. Make sure to include the VA's mission, the number of prescriptions, the comparison in death rates, and the FDA's stance. Also, mention that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side effects.

Alright, I think that's all the essential information. Time to put it together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, with only three prescriptions in the last week. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug as a way to provide hope when few treatment options were available. However, studies highlighting potential dangers and the emergence of alternative treatments like remdesivir led to the reduction. President Trump's promotion of the drug without scientific evidence was noted, but Wilkie emphasized learning from the crisis and prioritizing life preservation. The VA has shifted to remdesivir, which showed reduced recovery times, and convalescent plasma. Data revealed that 28% of veterans on hydroxychloroquine died, compared to 11% without the drug. Weekly prescriptions peaked at 404 in mid-March before tapering off in April. The VA may continue using hydroxychloroquine in clinical trials, following guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci. Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding Fauci's warnings earlier. No large studies have proven hydroxychloroquine's safety or effectiveness for COVID-19, and the FDA advises its use only in formal studies. The VA has prescribed the drug to 1,370 veterans, emphasizing medical appropriateness and informed consent. END OF SUMMARY.
