Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans. The user also wants me to identify the morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those frames.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The VA stopped using hydroxychloroquine because studies showed possible dangers. They initially used it to give hope, but as more information came out, they reduced its use. President Trump was promoting the drug, but there's no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The VA is now using remdesivir and convalescent plasma instead. There were high death rates among veterans who took hydroxychloroquine, and the prescriptions peaked when Trump was promoting it. The VA will continue using the drug only in clinical trials, following Dr. Fauci's guidance. Rep. Lowey criticized the VA for not listening to Fauci earlier. The FDA warns against using the drug outside of studies, and the VA says they only used it when appropriate after discussing risks with patients.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to find all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a moral judgment or imply right/wrong, good/bad. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

"Unproven" – implies something is not reliable, which is a moral judgment.
"Hope" – positive, but maybe not a moral word on its own.
"Possible dangers" – danger is negative, but "possible" is just a qualifier. "Dangers" is a moral concern.
"Preserve and protect life" – clearly moral, about saving lives.
"Responsibility" – a moral concept about duties.
"Backlash" – implies negative reactions, which is a moral judgment.
"Caution" – a prudent action, but not inherently moral.
"Rebuke" – criticism, which is a moral judgment.
"Wishful thinking" – implies irrationality, a negative trait.
"Ethical" – directly a moral term.
"Appropriate" – implies suitability, but can be moral.
"Risks" – a concern, but not inherently moral unless in context.
"Effective" – more about outcome than morality.
"Serious side effects" – negative impact, moral concern.
"Clear" – about clarity, not moral.
"Guidance" – about advice, not inherently moral.
"Learning" – neutral.
"Emerging" – neutral.
"Surged" – neutral.
"Prescribed" – neutral.
"Benefits" – positive outcome, not inherently moral.
"Deadly" – negative, moral concern.
"Unproven" – again, same as before.

Wait, I think I need to be careful. The user wants single words that are morally framed. So "unproven" is more about effectiveness, but in the context, it's about not being proven safe, which is a moral issue. "Hope" is positive but not a moral judgment. "Dangers" is a negative outcome, so it's a moral concern. "Preserve and protect life" is definitely a moral statement. "Responsibility" is a duty, so moral. "Backlash" implies negative judgment from others. "Rebuke" is a criticism, so moral. "Wishful thinking" is about irrationality, which is a flaw. "Ethical" is directly moral. "Appropriate" can be moral if it's about suitability in a moral context. "Risks" are a concern but not inherently moral. "Deadly" is a negative outcome, so moral.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user wants single words that are morally framed. So, words like "unproven," "hope," "dangers," "preserve," "protect," "life," "responsibility," "backlash," "caution," "rebuke," "wishful," "thinking," "ethical," "appropriate," "risks," "effective," "serious," "side," "effects," "clear," "guidance," "learning," "emerging," "surged," "prescribed," "benefits," "deadly."

Wait, no, "side effects" is two words, so I can't include it. Similarly, "clear guidance" is two words. So I need to pick single words that are morally framed.

So, going through the article again:

- "unproven" – morally framed because it's about not being proven safe.
- "hope" – positive, but not a moral judgment.
- "dangers" – negative outcomes, moral concern.
- "preserve" – to save, moral action.
- "protect" – to safeguard, moral.
- "life" – essential, moral.
- "responsibility" – duty, moral.
- "backlash" – negative reaction, moral judgment.
- "caution" – prudent, but not inherently moral.
- "rebuke" – criticism, moral.
- "wishful" – implies irrationality, a flaw.
- "thinking" – neutral.
- "ethical" – directly moral.
- "appropriate" – suitability, can be moral.
- "risks" – concern, but not inherently moral.
- "effective" – about outcome, not moral.
- "serious" – about severity, not moral.
- "effects" – neutral.
- "clear" – about clarity, not moral.
- "guidance" – advice, not moral.
- "learning" – neutral.
- "emerging" – neutral.
- "surged" – neutral.
- "prescribed" – neutral.
- "benefits" – positive, not moral.
- "deadly" – negative outcome, moral.

So, the morally framed single words are: unproven, dangers, preserve, protect, life, responsibility, backlash, rebuke, wishful, ethical, appropriate, deadly.

Wait, "wishful" is part of "wishful thinking," but the user wants single words. So "wishful" is a single word, but it's part of a phrase. Maybe "wishful" alone is not a moral frame, but in context, "wishful thinking" is. However, the user wants single words, so perhaps "wishful" isn't the best choice. Maybe "thinking" isn't moral. Alternatively, "wishful" could be considered as implying a moral failing.

Alternatively, maybe "unproven," "dangers," "preserve," "protect," "life," "responsibility," "backlash," "rebuke," "ethical," "appropriate," "deadly."

I think that's a better list. Let me make sure each of these words carries a moral connotation in the context.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main points: VA stopping hydroxychloroquine, initial use for hope, studies showing dangers, Trump's promotion, shift to remdesivir, high death rates, prescriptions peaking with Trump's promotion, criticism from Rep. Lowey, FDA warnings, VA's ethical use, and the moral implications.

I'll structure the summary to include these points, using the morally framed words where appropriate.

**STEP 1:**

* unproven
* dangers
* preserve
* protect
* life
* responsibility
* backlash
* rebuke
* ethical
* appropriate
* deadly

**SUMMARY:**

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, citing concerns over its unproven efficacy and potential dangers. Initially, the drug was used to provide hope, but studies highlighted risks, leading to a shift toward remdesivir. President Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine, despite lack of evidence, coincided with a surge in prescriptions. VA data revealed higher death rates among veterans using the drug, prompting criticism for not adhering to ethical guidelines from the start. The VA now follows Dr. Anthony Fauci's cautionary advice, using hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials. The FDA warns against its use outside studies, emphasizing the need for appropriate, ethical treatment. The VA's responsibility to protect life and learn from scientific evidence underscores the moral implications of its decisions. END OF SUMMARY.
