SUMMARY:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has almost stopped using an unproven malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. While VA Secretary Robert Wilkie initially justified its use by giving hope to veterans with few treatment options, he acknowledged that its use has been "ratcheted down" as studies highlighted potential dangers and other treatments, such as remdesivir, became available. 

The VA's decision follows criticism from major veterans organizations and an analysis showing that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce deaths among veterans with COVID-19. Data revealed that weekly prescriptions surged after President Trump began promoting the drug, but have since tapered off. Despite this, Wilkie expects the VA to continue limited use of hydroxychloroquine in clinical trials, guided by Dr. Anthony Fauci's expertise. 

Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding Fauci's earlier warnings about the drug, urging them to prioritize rigorous scientific evidence over wishful thinking. The VA maintains that hydroxychloroquine was only prescribed when medically appropriate, with full disclosure of risks to patients.
