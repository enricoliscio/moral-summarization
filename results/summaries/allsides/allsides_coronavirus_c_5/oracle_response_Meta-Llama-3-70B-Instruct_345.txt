SUMMARY:

The Veterans Affairs (VA) department has significantly reduced its use of the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing concerns over possible dangers and the availability of alternative treatments. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, stating it was necessary "to give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, as studies pointed to potential risks, the VA has "ratcheted down" its use of the drug, with only three prescriptions in the last week. The department is now turning to remdesivir, which has shown promising results in reducing recovery time. Wilkie emphasized the VA's mission "to preserve and protect life," and that they are "all learning as we go in this crisis." The decision comes after major veterans organizations called on the VA to explain its use of hydroxychloroquine, citing an analysis that showed hundreds of veterans saw no benefit from the drug. Rep. Nita Lowey urged the VA to respond to the science and guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci, rather than "wishful thinking" from the president.
