SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped almost all use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, on veterans with COVID-19. While initially defending the use of the drug as a way to give patients hope, Wilkie acknowledged that the VA hospitals have since ratcheted down its use as studies pointed to potential dangers and other possible treatments, such as remdesivir, became available. The VA's data showed that weekly prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged in mid-March, coinciding with President Trump's promotion of the drug, but have since tapered off amid scientific counsel urging caution and pointing to possible side effects. Major veterans organizations had called on the VA to explain its use of hydroxychloroquine after an analysis of VA hospital data showed no benefit for COVID-19 patients. The VA has emphasized that the drug was only prescribed after a full discussion between doctor and patient about the risks, and Wilkie expects limited use of the drug to continue in the future, particularly in clinical trials. This decision aligns with the guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, who has urged caution on the use of hydroxychloroquine. The VA's mission is to preserve and protect the lives of veterans by relying on scientific evidence and studies.
