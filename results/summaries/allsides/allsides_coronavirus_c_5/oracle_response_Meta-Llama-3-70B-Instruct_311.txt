SUMMARY: 

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has largely stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19, citing studies that pointed to possible dangers. Initially, the VA had used the drug to "give them hope" when few treatment options were available. However, as other possible treatments emerged, the VA "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week. Wilkie emphasized that the VA's mission is to "preserve and protect life." The department is now turning to remdesivir, which has shown reduced recovery time in preliminary results. Major veterans organizations had called on the VA to explain its use of hydroxychloroquine after an analysis showed hundreds of veterans saw no benefit for COVID-19. Rep. Nita Lowey rebuked Wilkie, saying the VA should have listened to Dr. Anthony Fauci's counsel urging caution on the drug from the start, rather than relying on "wishful thinking" from the president.
