SUMMARY:

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has almost stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans. Initially, the VA used the drug to give patients hope due to limited treatment options, but as studies showed possible dangers and other treatments became available, its use was significantly reduced. Only three prescriptions were issued in the last week. The VA is now turning to remdesivir and convalescent plasma, which have shown promising results. The decision comes after major veterans organizations called for an explanation of the VA's use of hydroxychloroquine, citing a study that found no benefit for COVID-19 patients and a higher death rate among those who took the drug. Wilkie said the VA may continue to use hydroxychloroquine in limited clinical trials, but its widespread use will likely cease.
