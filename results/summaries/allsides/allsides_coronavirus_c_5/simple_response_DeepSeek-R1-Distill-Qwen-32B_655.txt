Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the key points and the underlying moral implications.

First, the article mentions that the VA has almost stopped using hydroxychloroquine, an unproven drug, on veterans with COVID-19. Secretary Wilkie defended the initial use as giving hope when there were few options, but as studies showed potential dangers, they reduced its use. This shows a shift from hope to caution, which is a moral consideration of patient safety over initial optimism.

President Trump's promotion of the drug despite lack of evidence is another point. This raises moral issues about the influence of political figures on medical decisions, especially when it might prioritize hope over scientific rigor.

The article also mentions that hydroxychloroquine prescriptions surged when Trump started promoting it, indicating a possible political influence on medical practice, which is a moral concern about decision-making based on political pressure rather than science.

The VA's pivot to remdesivir and convalescent plasma shows a move towards more evidence-based treatments, highlighting the importance of adhering to scientific evidence in medicine. This is a positive moral stance emphasizing the value of scientific research and patient safety.

The data showing higher death rates in veterans taking hydroxychloroquine versus those who didn't is a critical moral point. It underscores the potential harm caused by using unproven treatments and the responsibility of medical institutions to ensure treatments are both safe and effective.

Rep. Lowey's rebuke of the VA for not listening to Fauci from the start adds another layer of moral judgment, suggesting that the VA should prioritize expert scientific advice over political influence.

The FDA's warning against hydroxychloroquine and its recommendation for only formal studies further reinforces the moral imperative of following scientific guidelines to prevent harm.

In the summary, I need to capture these elements: the reduction in drug use, initial hope vs. caution, political influence, shift to evidence-based treatments, the negative outcomes from the drug, and the call for adherence to scientific guidelines. I should structure the summary to highlight these moral considerations without being too technical, keeping it concise and within 200 words.

I should start by stating the main action (VA stopping use), then explain the initial use for hope, the reasons for stopping (studies and side effects), mention Trump's influence, the shift to remdesivir, the negative outcomes, and the call for science-based decisions. I'll need to ensure that each of these points flows logically and maintains the moral framing throughout.

I also need to make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the key points without unnecessary details. Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll also make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, citing concerns over its safety and effectiveness. Secretary Robert Wilkie initially defended the drug's use as a "hope" option when few treatments were available, but studies highlighted potential dangers, leading to a sharp decline in prescriptions. President Trump's promotion of the drug without scientific backing drew criticism, and the VA shifted to evidence-based treatments like remdesivir. Data showed higher death rates among veterans taking hydroxychloroquine, prompting calls for adherence to scientific guidelines. The VA now plans to use the drug only in clinical trials, aligning with expert advice. END OF SUMMARY.
