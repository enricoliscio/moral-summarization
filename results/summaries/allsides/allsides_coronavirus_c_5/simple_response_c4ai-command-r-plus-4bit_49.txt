SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has almost completely stopped the use of an unproven malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. While initially defending its use as a way to offer hope to patients with few other options, Wilkie acknowledged that the department has significantly reduced prescriptions as studies have highlighted potential dangers and other possible treatments, such as remdesivir, have emerged. 

The VA's decision follows criticism from major veterans organizations and an analysis showing that veterans who took hydroxychloroquine experienced higher death rates than those receiving standard care. The department's data revealed a surge in prescriptions coinciding with President Trump's promotion of the drug, but usage has since tapered off. 

Wilkie emphasized the VA's commitment to protecting lives and indicated a continued limited use of hydroxychloroquine in clinical trials, guided by Dr. Anthony Fauci's expertise. Rep. Nita Lowey urged the VA to prioritize scientific evidence over presidential wishful thinking, highlighting the lack of rigorous studies supporting the drug's safety and effectiveness for COVID-19 treatment. The FDA has also warned against its use outside of formal studies. 

The VA maintains that hydroxychloroquine was only prescribed when medically appropriate and after full disclosure of risks to patients.
