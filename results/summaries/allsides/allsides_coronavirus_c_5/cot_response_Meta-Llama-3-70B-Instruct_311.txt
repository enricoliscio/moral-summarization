SUMMARY:
The Veterans Affairs department has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, on veterans with COVID-19, citing possible dangers and lack of scientific evidence. Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug, saying it was justified "to give them hope" when treatment options were limited. However, as studies pointed to potential risks and other treatments emerged, the VA "ratcheted it down" to just three prescriptions in the last week. Wilkie emphasized the VA's mission "to preserve and protect life," and acknowledged that "we are all learning as we go in this crisis." The department is now turning to remdesivir, which has shown reduced recovery time and convalescent plasma. The move is seen as a response to the science, rather than "wishful thinking" from the president. END OF SUMMARY.
