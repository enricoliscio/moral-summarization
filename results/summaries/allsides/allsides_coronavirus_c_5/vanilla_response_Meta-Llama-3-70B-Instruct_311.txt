SUMMARY:

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has almost stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19. Initially, the VA used the drug to give patients hope, but as studies revealed possible dangers and other treatments became available, its use was significantly reduced. Only three prescriptions were issued in the last week. The VA has turned to other treatments, such as remdesivir, which has shown promising results. The department's use of hydroxychloroquine was heavily criticized after an analysis showed no benefit for COVID-19 patients and a higher death rate among those who took the drug. Wilkie expects the VA to continue using the drug in limited forms, such as clinical trials, but lawmakers urged the VA to follow scientific guidance and caution.

END OF SUMMARY.
