SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to treat COVID-19 in veterans. While initially defending its use due to the lack of treatment options, Wilkie acknowledged that the VA has since reduced prescriptions as studies highlighted potential dangers and other treatments became available. The VA's decision follows an analysis showing no benefit for COVID-19 patients taking the drug and backlash from veterans organizations. Weekly prescriptions surged after President Trump promoted its use, but have since tapered off. The VA expects to continue limited use of the drug in clinical trials, but Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the VA for not heeding Dr. Anthony Fauci's cautionary advice on the drug earlier. The FDA has warned against using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of formal studies, and the VA maintains that it was prescribed only when medically appropriate with full disclosure of risks. 

END OF SUMMARY.
