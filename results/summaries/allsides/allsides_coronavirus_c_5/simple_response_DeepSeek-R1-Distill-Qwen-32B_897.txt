Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans with COVID-19. The secretary, Robert Wilkie, defended its initial use as giving hope, but then they scaled back after studies showed possible dangers. President Trump was promoting the drug without evidence. The VA is now using remdesivir instead. There's also mention of veterans organizations criticizing the VA's use of the drug, and some data showing higher death rates in those who took it. They're now only using it in clinical trials based on Dr. Fauci's guidance, but a congresswoman rebuked them for not listening to Fauci earlier. The drug hasn't been proven safe or effective and has serious side effects. The FDA warns against it except in studies.

Okay, so the moral framing here is about the VA's responsibility to protect lives and make decisions based on science. They initially used the drug out of hope but then responsibly reduced its use as evidence showed risks. The conflict with Trump's promotion adds a layer of external pressure versus scientific caution. The organizations criticizing them highlight accountability. The summary needs to capture this balance between hope, responsibility, and scientific integrity.

I should structure the summary to first state the main action (VA stopping use), then explain the initial justification, the scaling back, the shift to other treatments, the criticism, and the current stance based on scientific guidance. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows logically, highlighting the moral considerations of patient safety and evidence-based decisions.

SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 in veterans, citing concerns over its safety and lack of proven efficacy. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug as a way to "give hope" during a time of limited treatment options. However, as studies highlighted potential dangers and alternative treatments like remdesivir became available, prescriptions dropped to just three in the last week. The VA, the nation's largest hospital system, has been criticized by veterans organizations for its earlier reliance on hydroxychloroquine, with data showing higher death rates among veterans who received the drug. Wilkie stated that the VA will continue using hydroxychloroquine only in clinical trials, following guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci. This decision drew criticism from Rep. Nita Lowey, who emphasized the need to prioritize scientific evidence over political influence. The FDA has warned against the drug's use outside of formal studies due to its potential risks, including heart rhythm problems. The VA has reported 13,657 COVID-19 cases and 1,200 deaths among veterans. END OF SUMMARY.
