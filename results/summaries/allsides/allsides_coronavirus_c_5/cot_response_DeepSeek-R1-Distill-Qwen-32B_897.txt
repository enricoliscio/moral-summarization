Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand the user's request. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I have to identify the morally charged words in the article and then create a summary that includes those words.

Looking at the article, it's about the VA stopping the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in veterans. The key morally framed words I notice are "unproven," "hope," "dangers," "learning," "mission," "preserve," "protect," "benefit," "died," "backlash," "caution," "wishful thinking," "science," and "risks." These words carry moral implications, showing the VA's responsibility, the risks involved, and the ethical considerations in their decision-making.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. I'll start by stating that the VA has almost stopped using hydroxychloroquine. I should mention that it was initially used to give hope, but as dangers emerged, usage decreased. I'll include the statistics about veterans infected and deaths, the shift to remdesivir, and the criticism from Rep. Lowey. Also, I should note that the VA will continue using the drug in clinical trials based on Dr. Fauci's guidance, and the FDA's warnings.

I have to ensure the summary is under 200 words and includes the identified moral words. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting from the decision to stop using the drug, the initial justification, the reasons for reducing usage, the shift to other treatments, criticism, and the ongoing use in trials. I'll make sure each sentence ties back to the moral aspects, like the VA's mission to preserve life and the ethical use of treatments.

I should also check that the summary accurately reflects the article's content without adding any personal opinions. It's important to maintain the balance between summarizing and highlighting the moral elements as the user requested. I'll review the summary to ensure it's clear, concise, and meets all the specified requirements.

**SUMMARY:**  
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has significantly reduced its use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment in veterans, citing concerns over its unproven efficacy and potential dangers. Initially, the drug was used to give hope amid limited treatment options, but its usage dropped to just three prescriptions in the last week as studies highlighted risks. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie emphasized the department's mission to preserve and protect life, shifting focus to remdesivir and convalescent plasma. However, data showed no significant benefit from hydroxychloroquine, with higher death rates among patients receiving the drug. The VA faced backlash after President Trump's promotion of the drug without scientific backing. While the VA plans to continue using hydroxychloroquine in limited clinical trials, Rep. Nita Lowey criticized the delay in following Dr. Anthony Fauci's cautionary advice. The FDA has warned against the drug's use outside formal studies due to its risks, including heart rhythm problems. The VA has prescribed hydroxychloroquine to 1,370 veterans, emphasizing medically appropriate use after discussions about risks. END OF SUMMARY.
