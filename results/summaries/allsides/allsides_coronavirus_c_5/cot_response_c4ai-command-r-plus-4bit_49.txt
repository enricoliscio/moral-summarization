SUMMARY:
The Veterans Affairs department has decided to stop the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven drug, on veterans with COVID-19. Despite initially justifying its use to give veterans hope, Secretary Robert Wilkie acknowledged that the treatment has been "ratcheted down" as studies highlighted its potential dangers. President Trump had previously promoted the drug heavily, but rigorous studies have failed to prove its safety and effectiveness. The VA's decision to reduce its usage is a rebuke to Trump's wishful thinking and a step towards following the counsel of Dr. Anthony Fauci, who urged caution on the drug. The VA's mission is to preserve and protect veterans' lives, and Wilkie expects the limited use of hydroxychloroquine to continue in clinical trials, ensuring medically appropriate decisions are made with full discussion of risks. The VA is now turning to remdesivir and convalescent plasma as possible treatments, putting hope in rigorous science rather than unproven claims.
