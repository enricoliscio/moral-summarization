SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has stopped administering hydroxychloroquine, an unproven malaria drug, to veterans with COVID-19. While initially defending its use as a way to offer hope and treatment options to veterans, Wilkie acknowledged that its usage has significantly decreased as studies highlight potential dangers and other treatments, like remdesivir, become available.

The VA's decision comes despite President Trump's heavy promotion of the drug and his own use of it as a preventive measure against COVID-19. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., criticized the VA for not heeding the warnings of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, who urged caution on the drug. The VA's data showed that prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged in mid-March, coinciding with Trump's endorsements, but have since tapered off. 

The VA's recent analysis revealed that 28% of veterans who took hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, compared to 11% who received routine care alone. This underscores the importance of relying on scientific evidence and expert advice rather than wishful thinking or political promotion. 

Wilkie stated that the VA will continue using hydroxychloroquine in limited forms, such as clinical trials, guided by Fauci's expertise. However, the primary focus is now on proven treatments and ensuring the safety and well-being of veterans under their care.
