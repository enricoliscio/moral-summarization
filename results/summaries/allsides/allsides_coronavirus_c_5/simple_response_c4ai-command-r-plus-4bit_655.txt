SUMMARY: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the department has almost entirely ceased the use of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven and potentially dangerous drug, on veterans with COVID-19. This decision comes after significant ethical concerns were raised about the initial use of the drug, which was promoted by President Trump despite a lack of scientific evidence. The VA's mission is to protect and preserve life, and Wilkie defended the initial use of the drug as a way to give hope to veterans with few treatment options. However, as studies emerged highlighting the potential dangers and ineffectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, the VA rightfully shifted its focus to other treatments such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma. This shift demonstrates the VA's commitment to making ethical and scientifically informed decisions, prioritizing the well-being and health of veterans above all else. While the VA will continue to use hydroxychloroquine in limited contexts, such as clinical trials, the reduction in prescriptions reflects a responsible and moral approach to veteran care. This decision should be commended as a step towards ensuring veterans receive the best possible treatment, based on scientific evidence and medical ethics. 

END OF SUMMARY.
