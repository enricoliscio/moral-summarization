SUMMARY:

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie announced that the VA has almost stopped using the unproven malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in veterans. Initially, the VA used the drug to give patients hope, but as studies showed possible dangers and other treatments became available, its use was significantly reduced. Only three prescriptions were issued in the last week. The VA is now turning to remdesivir and convalescent plasma, which have shown promising results. The decision comes after major veterans organizations called for an explanation of the VA's use of hydroxychloroquine, citing an analysis that showed hundreds of veterans who took the drug saw no benefit. The VA has prescribed the drug to 1,370 veterans, but Wilkie expects its use to continue in limited forms, such as clinical trials.

END OF SUMMARY.
