SUMMARY:
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is being hauled into federal court for defying the law and denying gay people their constitutionally protected rights, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has refused, claiming "God's authority" as her justification. This morally dubious stand has appealed to some conservative presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are cheering on her defiance of the Constitution. Huckabee has even called Davis a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny." However, not all Republicans agree, with Carly Fiorina urging Davis to either give up or resign. The situation could escalate further if Davis is punished harshly, potentially inspiring others to defy the Constitution and champion brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
