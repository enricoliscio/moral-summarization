SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis has been refusing to issue marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight, citing her religious beliefs, despite orders from the governor and a federal judge to do her job. She is now being brought before a judge to determine if she is in contempt of court. Davis's defiance of the law has appealed to a slice of the conservative movement that wants to restore discrimination against gay people, and several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, have voiced their support for her actions. Bobby Jindal has also endorsed Davis, while Carly Fiorina has urged her to either comply or resign. The situation could become more complicated if Davis is punished harshly by the courts, as she could be perceived as a martyr and inspire others to defy the Constitution.

END OF SUMMARY.
