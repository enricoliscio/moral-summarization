Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, who's refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage. She's been defying court orders, and now she's facing contempt charges. The author is clearly critical of her actions, calling them illegal and morally wrong. They also point out how some Republican candidates are supporting her, which the author sees as problematic.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral judgment against Davis. The key points are her defiance, the legal consequences, the support from politicians, and the broader implications for the law and equality.

I should start by stating her refusal to issue licenses, her defiance of the law, and the Supreme Court ruling. Then mention her contempt hearing. Highlight her claim of God's authority and the author's view that the Constitution should take precedence. Include the support from Huckabee, Paul, and Jindal, and note that others like Fiorina are against her. Finally, mention the potential for her to become a martyr and the impact on the 2016 race.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all these elements. Make sure the moral framing is clear—emphasizing her breaking the law and the negative implications of her stance.

SUMMARY:  
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis continues to defy the law by refusing to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs, despite the Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. She has ignored orders from the governor, a federal judge, and the Supreme Court, leading to a contempt of court hearing. Her claim that "God’s authority" allows her to deny constitutional rights is condemned as illegal and morally wrong. Davis has gained support from conservative politicians, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who applaud her defiance. However, some candidates, like Carly Fiorina, urge her to resign or comply. The article criticizes her stance as a threat to equality and notes that her potential imprisonment could inspire further defiance, complicating the 2016 presidential race. END OF SUMMARY.
