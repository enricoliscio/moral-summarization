SUMMARY: Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, is appearing in federal court to explain why she believes she has the right to break the law and deny gay couples their constitutional rights by refusing to issue marriage licenses. Davis has defied orders from the governor and a federal judge to do her job, and is now being held in contempt of court. She claims that her religious beliefs empower her to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples, despite the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage. Several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, have praised Davis for her stand against gay marriage, with Huckabee calling her a hero for defying "judicial tyranny." Davis' actions and the support she has received from some conservatives highlight a dangerous trend of championing illegality and discrimination in the name of religious beliefs. If Davis is punished harshly, she could become a martyr for the anti-gay movement and further complicate the already tense situation. Carly Fiorina, on the other hand, has urged Davis to either comply with the law or resign. The case of Kim Davis underscores the ongoing struggle between religious freedom and equal rights in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
