Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, is refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs, even after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. She's been ordered to do her job but keeps refusing, leading to her being in contempt of court. The author uses strong moral language like "break," "deny," "refusing," and "defiance." 

I should make sure to include these words in the summary. The article also mentions how some Republican candidates are supporting her, which the author views negatively. I'll need to highlight that as well. The key points are her defiance, the legal consequences, and the political backing she's receiving. I'll structure the summary to include her actions, the legal context, and the reactions from politicians, using the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is defying federal court orders by refusing to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs. Despite the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage, Davis continues to deny couples their rights, breaking her oath to uphold the Constitution. Her actions, which include abusing her authority and defying the law, have led to contempt charges. Davis claims "Godâ€™s authority" as her justification, a stance that aligns with a segment of the conservative movement seeking to restore discriminatory practices. Republican candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul have praised her defiance, with Huckabee calling her a hero against "judicial tyranny." Others, like Carly Fiorina, urge her to resign. The situation could inspire further illegality if Davis is seen as a martyr, potentially encouraging more anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
