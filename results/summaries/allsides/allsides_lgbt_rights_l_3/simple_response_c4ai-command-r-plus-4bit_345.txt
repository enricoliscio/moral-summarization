SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is appearing in federal court to explain why she believes her religious convictions empower her to deny gay couples their legal right to marry. Davis has refused to issue marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight, despite orders from the governor and a federal judge to do her job. She claims that her actions are justified by "God's authority," but as a government employee, she is bound by oath to adhere to the law and the Constitution. Davis' defiance has attracted support from several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, who have praised her for standing up against "judicial tyranny." Bobby Jindal has also endorsed Davis, arguing that no one should have to choose between their religious beliefs and their job. However, not all Republican candidates support Davis, and her punishment for contempt of court could influence how other Republican presidents respond to similar situations in the future. Davis' illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage appeals to a segment of the conservative movement that wants to restore discrimination against gay people. Her actions and the support she receives from Republican candidates reflect a troubling willingness to champion illegality and discrimination in the name of religious beliefs. END OF SUMMARY.
