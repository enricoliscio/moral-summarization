SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to justify her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has continued to defy the law, breaking her oath to uphold the Constitution. Her actions are a flagrant display of contempt, and she should be punished for denying gay people their constitutionally protected rights. Davis' illegal and morally dubious stand has garnered support from Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are championing her brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination. Huckabee has even hailed Davis as a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny." If Davis is punished harshly, she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution and discriminate against gay people. END OF SUMMARY.
