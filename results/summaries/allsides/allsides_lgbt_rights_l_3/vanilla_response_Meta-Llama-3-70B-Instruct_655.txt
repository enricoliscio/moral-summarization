SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to explain why she continues to deny marriage licenses to gay couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has refused, and the Supreme Court rejected her appeal. Davis claims she is empowered by God to break the law, but her actions are in contempt of court. Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal have come out in support of Davis, praising her for defying the Constitution. Huckabee called her a hero, while Paul and Jindal said she should not have to choose between her job and her religious beliefs. However, not all Republican candidates agree, with Carly Fiorina urging Davis to resign or comply with the law. The situation could escalate if Davis is punished harshly, potentially inspiring others to defy the Constitution.

END OF SUMMARY.
