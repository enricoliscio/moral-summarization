SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to explain why she refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has continued to defy the law. The Supreme Court recently rejected her appeal, but she still refuses to comply. Davis claims that God's authority empowers her to break the law, which is in direct conflict with her oath to adhere to the Constitution. Her actions have been praised by some Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who see her as a hero standing up to "judicial tyranny." However, others, like Carly Fiorina, have urged Davis to either comply with the law or resign. If Davis is punished for contempt of court, she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution in the name of anti-gay discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
