SUMMARY:
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is appearing in federal court to explain why she believes that her personal convictions empower her to break the law and deny gay people their rights, guaranteed by the Constitution. Davis has been refusing to issue marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight, citing her religious beliefs. She has defied orders from the governor and a federal judge to do her job and continues to flout the law, claiming she has God's authority. Davis' stand against gay marriage appeals to a slice of the conservative movement that wants to restore discrimination against gay people, and several Republican presidential candidates are cheering on her defiance. Mike Huckabee, for example, called Davis a hero for standing up to what he called "judicial tyranny." Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal also expressed support for Davis, with Jindal saying people shouldn't have to choose between their beliefs and their jobs. However, Davis is clearly in contempt of court and should be punished for breaking the law. If she is punished harshly, there is a risk that she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution in the name of anti-gay discrimination. Carly Fiorina, on the other hand, urged Davis to either comply or resign.
