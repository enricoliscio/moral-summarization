SUMMARY: Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, is in contempt of court for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Davis claims that her religious beliefs empower her to break the law and deny gay people their constitutional rights. She has been ordered by both the governor and a federal judge to perform her job duties, but she continues to defy the law. This has led to a situation where several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, are supporting a rogue government employee's illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage to appeal to a conservative base. Davis' actions and the support she receives from Republican candidates are a dangerous endorsement of discrimination and a blatant disregard for the Constitution. Other Republican candidates, such as Carly Fiorina, have urged Davis to either comply with the law or resign. The situation is further complicated by the potential consequences Davis may face, as a harsh punishment could turn her into a martyr and further fuel anti-gay discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
