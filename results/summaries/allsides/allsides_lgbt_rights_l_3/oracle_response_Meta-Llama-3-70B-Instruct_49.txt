SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to explain why she believes her personal convictions and God empower her to break the law and deny gay people their constitutionally protected rights. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to issue marriage licenses, Davis has refused, citing her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, but she continues to defy the law, insisting she suffers no consequences for her behavior. Davis' illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage has garnered support from Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are cheering on her defiance of the Constitution. Huckabee even called her a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny." Davis' actions are a brazen example of contempt of court, and she should be punished for breaking her oath and abusing her authority. If she is punished harshly, she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution and championing illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination.

END OF SUMMARY.
