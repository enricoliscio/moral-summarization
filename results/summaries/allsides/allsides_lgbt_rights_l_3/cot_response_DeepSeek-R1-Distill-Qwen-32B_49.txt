Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kim Davis. The user wants me to first identify all the morally framed words and then write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible. 

Looking at the article, I see several strong moral terms. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the article talks about Kim Davis refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs. Words like "deny," "refusing," "defy," "contempt," "illegal," "morally dubious," "discriminate," "tyranny," "courage," "stand," "conscience," "martyr," and "illegality" stand out as morally charged.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these terms. I should mention her defiance, the court's stance, the support from certain politicians, and the potential consequences. I also need to highlight the moral implications, like how her actions are seen as illegal and against constitutional rights.

I should make sure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally. I'll start by stating her defiance, mention the legal context, her refusal despite orders, the support from Huckabee, Paul, and Jindal, and the potential impact on the Republican candidates. I'll also note the criticism from Fiorina and the possible consequences if she's jailed, which could inspire others.

I need to ensure that the summary captures the moral framing without being too verbose. Let me structure it to include all the key points and the relevant moral terms.

**SUMMARY:**  
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is in federal court for defying the law and denying gay couples their constitutional rights by refusing to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs. Despite orders from the governor and a federal judge, and the Supreme Court rejecting her appeal, Davis persists in her defiance, claiming "God’s authority" as her justification. This stance is seen as illegal and morally dubious, as government employees are bound by the Constitution. Davis’s actions appeal to a conservative segment seeking to restore discriminatory practices, with several Republican candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, supporting her. Huckabee praised her as a hero against "judicial tyranny," while Paul and Jindal endorsed her "courage" in standing by her beliefs. However, some, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to resign. If Davis faces harsh penalties, including jail, she could become a martyr, inspiring further defiance. Her actions highlight the tension between religious beliefs and constitutional obligations, with implications for the Republican presidential race.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
