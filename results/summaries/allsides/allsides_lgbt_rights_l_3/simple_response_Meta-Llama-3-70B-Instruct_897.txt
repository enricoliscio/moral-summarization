SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is defying the law by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has continued to break the law, and the Supreme Court has rejected her appeal. Davis's actions are a blatant example of contempt of court, and she should be punished for her behavior. Her stance has been cheered on by some Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are using her defiance to appeal to conservative voters. However, this support for Davis's illegal actions is morally dubious and undermines the rule of law. By championing Davis's brazen illegality, these candidates are promoting discrimination against gay people and threatening the integrity of the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
