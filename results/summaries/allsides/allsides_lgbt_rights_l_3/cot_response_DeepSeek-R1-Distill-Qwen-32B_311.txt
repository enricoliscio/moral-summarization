Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Kim Davis refusing to issue marriage licenses due to her religious beliefs, which the author views negatively. 

The user has two main tasks: identifying morally framed words and writing a summary. For the first part, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "defy," "contempt," "authority," "discriminate," "tyranny," "courage," "martyr," and "illegality" stand out as they express judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, I'll summarize the article. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of those moral words as possible. The summary should cover who Kim Davis is, her actions, the legal context, her defiance, the support she's receiving, and the implications for the Republican candidates. I'll make sure to highlight her refusal, the legal consequences, and the moral arguments presented, especially the criticism of her stance and the support from certain politicians.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with her defiance, moving to the legal issues, then the political support, and ending with the potential consequences. I'll avoid adding my own opinions and stick to the facts while keeping the moral framing intact as per the original article.

Let me structure the summary: mention her refusal, the court cases, the support from Huckabee, Paul, and Jindal, and the potential impact on the election. I'll use the identified moral words to maintain the tone. I'll keep each point concise to stay within the word limit.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it captures all key points and maintains the moral perspective. I'll make sure it's clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. That should fulfill the user's request effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is facing federal court for defying the law and denying gay couples their constitutionally protected rights by refusing to issue marriage licenses. Her stance, grounded in religious beliefs, has drawn widespread criticism for defying the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges ruling. Davis, who has been ordered to perform her duties by both the governor and a federal judge, continues to resist, claiming “God’s authority” as her justification. This has led to accusations of contempt of court and a breach of her oath to uphold the Constitution.  

Her defiance has been cheered by conservative figures, including Republican presidential candidates like Mike Huckabee, who called her a hero, and Rand Paul, who praised her “courage.” Others, like Bobby Jindal, have expressed support for her right to follow her conscience, while Carly Fiorina has urged her to resign. The situation highlights a broader conflict between religious freedom and constitutional obligations, with fears that harsh penalties for Davis could inspire further defiance and anti-gay discrimination.
