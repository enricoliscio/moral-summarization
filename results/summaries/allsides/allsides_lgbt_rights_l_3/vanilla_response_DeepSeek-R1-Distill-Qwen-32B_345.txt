Okay, I need to summarize the given news article about Kim Davis. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling. She cites her religious beliefs as the reason. The governor and a federal judge ordered her to do her job, but she refused. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, so she's now facing contempt of court charges.

She claims God's authority, which the article criticizes because government employees should follow the Constitution. The article mentions that her stance appeals to a conservative group wanting to return to discriminatory times. Some Republican candidates, like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, support her, while others like Carly Fiorina urge her to step down.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include key points: her defiance, the legal actions against her, her religious reasoning, the political backing, and the implications of her case.

I should structure it to cover her actions, the legal context, her reasoning, the political support, and the potential consequences. I'll make sure to mention the candidates who support her and those who don't, as well as the possible impact of her punishment.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.
