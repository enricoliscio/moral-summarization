Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, who refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs. She's been ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job but has defied them. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, and now she's in contempt of court. The article also mentions support from several Republican candidates like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, while others like Carly Fiorina urge her to resign.

I need to capture the moral framing, which seems to criticize Davis for her defiance of the law and the Constitution. The author also points out how her stance is being used by politicians for political gain, especially within the conservative movement. It's important to highlight that her actions are seen as illegal and morally wrong, and how this could inspire others to defy the law.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: Davis's refusal, her defiance of legal orders, the Supreme Court's decision, the support from politicians, and the potential consequences of her actions. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspective is clear, emphasizing her breaking of the law and the implications for the rule of law.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all necessary elements while maintaining the author's critical stance.
