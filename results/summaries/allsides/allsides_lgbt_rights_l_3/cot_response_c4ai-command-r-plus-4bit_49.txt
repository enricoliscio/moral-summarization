SUMMARY:
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is appearing in federal court to explain why she believes God and her personal convictions empower her to defy the law and deny gay couples their constitutionally protected rights by refusing to issue marriage licenses. Davis has flagrantly shown contempt for the law and has refused to do her job, even after being ordered by a federal judge and the Supreme Court to do so. Her illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage appeals to a slice of the conservative movement that wants to restore discrimination against gay people with the state's blessing. This has led to several Republican presidential candidates cheering on Davis' rogue behavior, including Mike Huckabee, who called her a hero for defying the "tyrants" of the Supreme Court. Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal also controversially endorsed her stand, while other Republicans like Carly Fiorina have urged Davis to either comply or resign. The situation is further complicated by the possibility of Davis being punished and perceived as a martyr, which could inspire further brazen illegality and discrimination. Davis is breaking her oath, defying the Constitution, and abusing her authority, and she must be held accountable for her contemptuous behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
