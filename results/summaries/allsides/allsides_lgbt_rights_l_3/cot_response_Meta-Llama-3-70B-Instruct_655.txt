SUMMARY:
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is being hauled to federal court for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis continues to defy the law, claiming "God's authority" as her justification. Her morally dubious stand against gay marriage has garnered support from Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are cheering on her defiance of the Constitution. Huckabee even called Davis a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny." However, Davis's illegal actions have been deemed flagrantly in contempt of court, and she may face punishment. If she is perceived as a martyr, it could inspire others to defy the Constitution, leading to more brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
