SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is defying the law by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has continued to break the law, and the Supreme Court has rejected her appeal. She will appear in federal court to explain her actions, which are a clear case of contempt of court. Davis's illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage has been cheered on by some Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are trying to appeal to conservative voters. This support for Davis's defiance of the Constitution is a disturbing trend, and if she is punished for her actions, she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the law. This is a dangerous erosion of the rule of law and a threat to the rights of marginalized communities.

END OF SUMMARY.
