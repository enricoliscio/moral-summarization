SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to explain why she has refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has continued to defy the law. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, but she still refuses to comply. Davis claims she is acting under "God's authority," which is not a valid reason for a government employee. Her actions have sparked controversy, with some Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, praising her defiance of the Constitution. Others, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to resign or comply with the law. If Davis is punished for contempt of court, she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution in the name of anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
