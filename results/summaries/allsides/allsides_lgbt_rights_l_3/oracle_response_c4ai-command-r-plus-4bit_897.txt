SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis has flagrantly defied the law by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, in contempt of court orders and the Constitution. Davis claims that her religious beliefs empower her to deny gay people their legally protected rights, a stance that has garnered support from some Republican presidential candidates. Mike Huckabee, for instance, has called Davis a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny," while Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal have also expressed their approval. However, not all Republican candidates support Davis, and her punishment for breaking the law could influence how this situation develops. Davis' actions and the response from some conservative politicians reflect a dangerous endorsement of illegal discrimination against gay people under the guise of religious freedom.
END OF SUMMARY.
