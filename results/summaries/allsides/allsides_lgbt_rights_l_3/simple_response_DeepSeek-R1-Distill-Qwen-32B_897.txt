Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Kim Davis while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, who refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. She cites her religious beliefs. She was ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, but she refused. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, and now she's facing contempt of court charges.

The author is clearly critical of her actions, calling her defiance "flagrant" and questioning her right to use religious authority in a government position. The Constitution is emphasized as the governing authority, not religious beliefs. The article also points out that her stance appeals to a conservative segment, and some Republican candidates are supporting her, which the author finds problematic, especially mentioning Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal. Others like Carly Fiorina are urging her to step down.

The moral framing here is that Davis is defying the law for personal beliefs, which is seen as wrong, especially in a public office. The article also warns about the potential for her to become a martyr, inspiring more defiance.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the critical tone and the moral implications. I'll highlight her defiance, the legal consequences, the political support, and the broader implications.

Let me structure it: start with her defiance, mention the legal actions against her, her refusal, the political backing, and the moral critique of using religion in public office. Conclude with the potential for her to inspire more defiance.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering all key points without losing the moral stance. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it concise.

Now, putting it all together, making sure each sentence is clear and within the word limit.
