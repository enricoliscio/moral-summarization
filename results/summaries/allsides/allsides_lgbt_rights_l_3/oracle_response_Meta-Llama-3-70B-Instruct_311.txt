SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to justify her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has continued to defy the law, breaking her oath to adhere to the Constitution. Her actions are a flagrant display of contempt, and she should be punished for denying gay people their constitutionally protected rights. Davis' stance has been championed by Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are motivated by a desire to restore discrimination against gay people. Huckabee has even hailed Davis as a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny." However, not all Republican candidates agree, with Carly Fiorina urging Davis to either resign or comply with the law. If Davis is punished harshly, she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution and championing brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
