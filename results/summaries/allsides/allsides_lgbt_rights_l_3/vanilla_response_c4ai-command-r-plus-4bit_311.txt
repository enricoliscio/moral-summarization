SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis has refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, citing her religious beliefs. She has defied orders from the governor and a federal judge, and now faces contempt of court charges. Davis has become a symbol for a segment of the conservative movement that opposes same-sex marriage, and several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, have voiced their support for her. Bobby Jindal has also endorsed Davis, while Carly Fiorina has suggested she either comply with the law or resign. Davis' defiance of the law and the Constitution has raised concerns about the potential for further encouragement of illegal behavior in the name of anti-gay discrimination. If Davis is punished harshly, there are fears that she could be perceived as a martyr and inspire others to break the law.
END OF SUMMARY.
