SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to explain why she continues to defy the law and deny gay couples their constitutionally protected right to marry. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, Davis has refused to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs. She has been ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, but has refused. The Supreme Court recently rejected her appeal, and now she faces contempt of court charges. Davis's actions have been praised by some Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who see her as a hero standing up to "judicial tyranny." However, her defiance of the Constitution and abuse of authority have been widely criticized. The outcome of her court appearance could have significant implications, potentially inspiring others to defy the Constitution if she is perceived as a martyr.

END OF SUMMARY.
