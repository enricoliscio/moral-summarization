SUMMARY:
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is being hauled to federal court for defying the law and denying gay couples their constitutionally protected rights, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has refused, claiming "God's authority" as her justification. This morally dubious stand has earned her praise from Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are championing her brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination. Huckabee has even called her a hero for defying the "tyrants" of the Supreme Court. However, not all Republican candidates agree, with Carly Fiorina urging Davis to either give up or resign. The situation could escalate if Davis is punished harshly, potentially inspiring others to defy the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
