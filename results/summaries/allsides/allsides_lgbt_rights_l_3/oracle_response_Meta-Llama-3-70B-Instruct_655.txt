SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is being hauled into federal court to explain why she believes her religious beliefs empower her to break the law and deny gay people their constitutionally protected rights. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to issue marriage licenses, Davis has refused, citing her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, but she continues to defy the law, insisting she suffers no consequences for her behavior. Her illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage has garnered support from Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are championing her brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination. Davis' actions are a clear case of contempt of court, and she should be punished for breaking her oath and defying the Constitution. If she is perceived as a martyr, it could inspire others to defy the Constitution, leading to further illegality and discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
