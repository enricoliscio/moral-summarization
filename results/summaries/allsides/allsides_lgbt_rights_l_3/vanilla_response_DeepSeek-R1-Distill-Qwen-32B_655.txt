Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Kim Davis. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the main points.

The article starts by saying that Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, is appearing in federal court. She's refusing to issue marriage licenses to anyone because of her religious beliefs, even after the Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. She's been ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, but she's still refusing. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, so she's in contempt of court. 

She claims God's authority as her reason for defying the law, which the article criticizes because as a government employee, she's supposed to follow the Constitution. The author mentions that her stance appeals to some conservatives and that several Republican candidates are supporting her, like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal. Some candidates, like Carly Fiorina, are urging her to resign instead.

The article also points out that if Davis is harshly punished, she might become a martyr, inspiring others to defy the law. This could affect the Republican candidates' stances, especially if they see her as a hero.

So, the key points are: Kim Davis defying the law due to religious beliefs, her contempt in court, support from some Republican candidates, and the potential impact of her punishment on the political landscape.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention her defiance, the court situation, her reasoning, the support from politicians, and the possible consequences of her punishment.

Let me structure it: Start with her defiance and court appearance, her refusal despite orders, the support from politicians, and the potential for her becoming a martyr.

I should make sure to include that her stance is seen as illegal and that some candidates support her while others don't. Also, the impact on the election if she's jailed.

I think that's the main points. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.
