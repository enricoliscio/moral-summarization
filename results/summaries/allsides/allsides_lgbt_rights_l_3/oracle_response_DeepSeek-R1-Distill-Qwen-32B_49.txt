Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should use as many as possible without making the summary too long. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, who's refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs. She's been ordered to do her job but keeps refusing. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, and now she's in contempt of court. The author is critical of her actions, calling them illegal and morally wrong. There's also mention of Republican candidates supporting her, which the author sees as problematic.

I need to include words like "break," "deny," "refusing," "ordered," "refused," "contempt," "punished," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight her defiance, the legal consequences, and the political support she's receiving, all while maintaining the moral critique from the article.

Let me start by introducing Kim Davis and her actions. Then mention the legal orders and her refusal. Include the Supreme Court's rejection and her contempt. Then touch on the political support from Huckabee, Paul, and Jindal, contrasting with Fiorina's stance. Finally, note the potential for her becoming a martyr and the implications for the candidates.

I should keep each sentence concise and make sure to incorporate the moral terms without making it sound forced. Let me piece it together step by step, ensuring the flow is logical and the moral framing is clear.

SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is facing federal court for defying orders to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs. Since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, Davis has refused to do her job, despite being *ordered* by the governor and a federal judge. Her *contempt* of court is clear, and she should be *punished* for breaking her oath to uphold the Constitution. Davis claims *Godâ€™s authority* over the law, a morally dubious stance that appeals to conservative efforts to *restore* discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. Republican candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul have *cheered* her defiance, framing it as a stand against *judicial tyranny*. Meanwhile, others like Carly Fiorina urge her to step down. If Davis is *punished harshly*, she could become a *martyr*, inspiring further *defiance* and *illegality* in the name of anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
