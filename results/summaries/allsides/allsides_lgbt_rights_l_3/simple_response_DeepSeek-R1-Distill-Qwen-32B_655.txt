Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kim Davis. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's stance.

The article starts by explaining that Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, is defying federal court orders by refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs. She's been ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, but she's still refusing. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, so she's now facing contempt charges. The author is clearly critical of her actions, calling them illegal and morally dubious.

The author also points out that Davis's stance is appealing to a segment of the conservative movement that wants to discriminate against gays, which is tied to some Republican presidential candidates. Mike Huckabee praises her, calling her a hero, while Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal also support her, though less enthusiastically. On the other hand, Carly Fiorina advises her to resign or step down.

The author seems to disapprove of Davis's defiance and the politicians supporting her, framing this as a problem with the Republican candidates who are using her case to rally their base. There's also a mention of the potential for Davis to become a martyr if she's jailed, which could inspire more defiance.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points while maintaining the author's critical tone. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key elements: Davis's defiance, the legal context, the political support, and the implications of her actions.

I should structure it by first introducing Davis and her defiance, then the legal situation, followed by the political backing, and conclude with the potential consequences. I'll make sure to include the author's disapproval of her actions and the politicians' support, highlighting the moral and legal issues involved.

Let me draft a summary that includes all these elements, keeping it within the word limit and maintaining the original moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is defying federal court orders by refusing to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs, despite the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage. Her refusal to comply with legal mandates has drawn criticism, as she is seen as breaking her oath to uphold the Constitution. Davis's stance, which she attributes to "Godâ€™s authority," has been condemned as illegal and morally questionable. Her defiance has garnered support from conservative politicians, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who view her as a symbol of resistance to perceived "judicial tyranny." However, some Republicans, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to step down. The situation highlights a broader conservative movement seeking to undermine LGBTQ+ rights, with potential Republican candidates exploiting her case to mobilize their base. If Davis faces harsh penalties, she could become a martyr for anti-gay discrimination, further polarizing the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
