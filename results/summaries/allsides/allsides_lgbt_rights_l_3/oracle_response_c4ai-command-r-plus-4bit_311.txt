SUMMARY: Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, is appearing in federal court to explain why she believes she has the right to break the law and deny gay couples their constitutional rights by refusing to issue marriage licenses. Davis has been ordered by both the governor and a federal judge to do her job, but she continues to refuse, citing her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, but she still defies the law. Davis' stand against gay marriage appeals to a segment of the conservative movement that wants to restore discrimination against gay people. Several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, have cheered on Davis' defiance, despite her being in contempt of court. Davis' punishment remains to be seen, but her case could inspire others to defy the Constitution if she is perceived as a martyr. This situation highlights the complex intersection of religious beliefs, personal convictions, and the law.
