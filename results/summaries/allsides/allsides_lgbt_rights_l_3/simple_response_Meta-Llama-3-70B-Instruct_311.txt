SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is defying the law by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis continues to break the law, claiming "God's authority" as her justification. Her actions are in contempt of court and morally dubious, as she is sworn to uphold the Constitution, not her personal beliefs. Davis' illegal stand has garnered support from some Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are using her defiance to appeal to conservative voters. This is a dangerous precedent, as it champions brazen illegality in the service of discrimination. If Davis is punished for her actions, she may be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution. It's essential to uphold the rule of law and protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.

END OF SUMMARY.
