SUMMARY:
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is being hauled into federal court for defying the law and denying gay people their constitutionally protected rights. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has refused, citing her religious beliefs. Her morally dubious stand against gay marriage has appealed to conservative Republicans, including presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are cheering on her defiance of the Constitution. Huckabee has even called Davis a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny." However, not all Republicans agree, with Carly Fiorina urging Davis to either give up or resign. If Davis is punished harshly, she could be perceived as a martyr, inspiring others to defy the Constitution in the service of anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
