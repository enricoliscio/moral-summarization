Alright, I need to summarize this article about Kim Davis. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis defying the Supreme Court's Obergefell ruling by refusing to issue marriage licenses. She cites her religious beliefs. The governor and a federal judge ordered her to do her job, but she refused. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, so she's in contempt of court.

She claims God's authority, which is problematic for a public official. The Constitution is the governing document, not her religious beliefs. The article also mentions that some Republican candidates support her, like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, while others like Carly Fiorina urge her to step down.

I should capture the main points: her defiance, the legal actions against her, her religious reasoning, the political support, and the potential consequences if she's jailed, which could inspire more defiance.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key elements without too much detail. Make sure to mention her refusal, the court's stance, her supporters, and the implications.

SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is facing federal court for contempt after refusing to issue marriage licenses following the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Citing religious beliefs, Davis has defied orders from the governor, a federal judge, and even the Supreme Court to perform her duties. She claims "Godâ€™s authority" as her reason for denying marriage licenses, a stance that conflicts with her constitutional oath as a public official. Davis has garnered support from some conservative figures, including Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who praised her defiance. However, others, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to resign or comply with the law. The article warns that if Davis is jailed, she could become a martyr figure, inspiring further defiance of the Constitution. END OF SUMMARY.
