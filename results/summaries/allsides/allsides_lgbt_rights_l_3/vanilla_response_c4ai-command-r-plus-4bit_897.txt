SUMMARY: Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, has refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite court orders, citing religious beliefs. Davis's actions have sparked a legal battle, with a federal judge ordering her to do her job and the Supreme Court rejecting her appeal. Davis continues to defy the law, arguing that her religious convictions empower her to break the law. Several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, have supported Davis, appealing to conservative voters. Huckabee called Davis a hero, while Paul suggested that standing up for beliefs is an important part of the American way. Bobby Jindal also endorsed Davis, stating that people shouldn't have to choose between their beliefs and their jobs. However, not all Republican candidates support Davis, with Carly Fiorina urging her to resign. Davis's actions have raised concerns about the potential for further illegal defiance of the Constitution if she is perceived as a martyr.
END OF SUMMARY.
