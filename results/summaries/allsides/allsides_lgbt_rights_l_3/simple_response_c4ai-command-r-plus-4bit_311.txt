SUMMARY: Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, is refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, citing her religious beliefs. Davis is breaking the law and defying the Constitution, and is now being held in contempt of court. Several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, are supporting Davis' illegal and morally dubious stand against gay marriage, appealing to a conservative base that wants to restore discrimination against gay people. Bobby Jindal has also endorsed Davis, while Carly Fiorina has suggested she give up or resign. Davis' actions and the support she receives from presidential candidates could inspire others to defy the Constitution and discriminate against gay people. This situation highlights the dangerous intersection of religion and politics, and the potential for elected officials to abuse their power by imposing their personal beliefs on others. It remains to be seen how the courts will punish Davis, but her case has already caused significant moral and legal controversy. END OF SUMMARY.
