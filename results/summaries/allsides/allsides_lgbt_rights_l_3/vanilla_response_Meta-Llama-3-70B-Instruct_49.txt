SUMMARY:

Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to explain why she refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage, Davis has continued to defy the law, ignoring orders from the governor and a federal judge. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, but she still refuses to do her job. Davis claims she is acting under "God's authority," which is not a valid answer for a government employee. Several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, have come out in support of Davis, praising her for defying the Constitution. This has sparked concerns that Davis's actions could inspire others to defy the law, potentially leading to further discrimination against gay people. The court will determine whether Davis is in contempt of court, and she may face punishment, including possible jail time. END OF SUMMARY.
