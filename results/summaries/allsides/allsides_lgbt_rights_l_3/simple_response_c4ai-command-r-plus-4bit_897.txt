SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is due in federal court to explain why she believes God and her personal convictions empower her to deny gay couples their constitutionally protected right to marriage. Davis has refused to issue marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight, since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges. Despite orders from the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has refused, citing religious beliefs. She is now being held in contempt of court and could face punishment.

Davis' defiance of the law has garnered support from a slice of the conservative movement and several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee, who called her a hero, and Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal, who praised her for standing up for her beliefs. However, not all Republican candidates support Davis, and her punishment could further complicate the situation, potentially inspiring others to defy the Constitution if she is perceived as a martyr. Carly Fiorina, for example, has urged Davis to either comply or resign. Davis' actions and the subsequent support from some conservatives and Republican candidates highlight a dangerous trend of championing illegality in the name of discrimination against gay people.

END OF SUMMARY.
