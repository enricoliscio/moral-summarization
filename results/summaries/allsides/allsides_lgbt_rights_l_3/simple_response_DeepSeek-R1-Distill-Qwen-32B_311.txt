Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Kim Davis while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about a Kentucky clerk refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs, despite the Supreme Court ruling that same-sex marriage is legal. She's being held in contempt of court. The article also mentions how some Republican candidates support her, which the author finds problematic because they're encouraging defiance of the law.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral issues here. The author is critical of Davis for breaking the law and using religion as an excuse. Also, the support from politicians like Huckabee and Rand Paul is seen as problematic because they're backing someone who's defying the Constitution. I should highlight the clash between religious freedom and the rule of law, and the political implications.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by introducing Davis and her defiance, mention the legal context, her contempt hearing, and the political support she's receiving. I'll note the author's disapproval of this support and the potential negative consequences if she's seen as a martyr.

Let me structure it: first, introduce Davis and her actions. Then, mention the legal rulings against her. Next, talk about the political backing, especially from Huckabee and others. Finally, conclude with the moral and political implications, emphasizing the danger of supporting lawlessness.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each politician's stance but mention the key ones to show the trend. Also, make sure to highlight the author's view that the Constitution, not religion, should govern public officials.

Alright, time to put it all together in a clear, concise summary that reflects the moral framing against her actions and the problematic support.

The author criticizes Davis for prioritizing her personal convictions over her civic duty, arguing that her defiance sets a dangerous precedent for others to ignore legal obligations. The situation highlights a clash between religious freedom and the supremacy of the Constitution, with some Republican candidates using her case to mobilize conservative voters.
