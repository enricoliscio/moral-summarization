SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis has been ordered to appear in federal court to explain her refusal to issue marriage licenses to any couple, gay or straight, citing her religious beliefs. Davis has defied orders from the governor and a federal judge, and continues to break the law by denying gay people their constitutionally protected rights. She is in contempt of court and faces punishment for her actions. Some Republican presidential candidates, such as Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, have praised Davis for her stand against gay marriage, while others, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to resign. Davis' defiance of the law could inspire others to defy the Constitution and discriminate against gay people. Her actions are morally dubious and illegal, and yet she insists on suffering no consequences. This situation highlights the divide within the Republican Party on the issue of gay rights and the role of the state.
