Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. Let me start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk who refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. She cites her religious beliefs. She's been ordered multiple times to do her job but keeps refusing. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, but she's still defying the orders, leading to a contempt of court hearing. The author criticizes her actions, using words like "break," "deny," "refusing," and "defiance."

The article also mentions support from some Republican candidates like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who praise her stance. Others, like Carly Fiorina, advise her to resign. There's a concern that if Davis is punished harshly, she might become a martyr, inspiring others to defy the law.

I need to make sure my summary includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. I should structure it to highlight her defiance, refusal to comply, the legal consequences, and the political support she's receiving. Also, the moral judgment against her actions should be clear.

Let me outline the key points:
1. Kim Davis defies court orders, refusing to issue marriage licenses.
2. She's been ordered multiple times but continues to refuse.
3. Supreme Court rejected her appeal, but she persists.
4. Facing contempt of court.
5. Supporters like Huckabee, Paul, and Jindal praise her defiance.
6. Critics warn she could inspire others to break the law.

Now, I'll craft a concise summary using the moral terms, ensuring it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is facing federal court for defying orders to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs. Despite being ordered by the governor and federal judge to comply, Davis refuses, even after the Supreme Court rejected her appeal. She insists on denying gay couples their rights, claiming "God’s authority," which the author condemns as breaking the law and defying the Constitution. Davis’ defiance has drawn support from conservative figures like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who praise her stand against what they see as judicial tyranny. However, critics warn that her defiance could inspire others to break the law, potentially turning her into a martyr for anti-gay discrimination. Her actions highlight a clash between personal convictions and constitutional obligations, with some Republicans championing her defiance while others, like Carly Fiorina, urge her to resign. END OF SUMMARY.
