Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Kim Davis, a Kentucky clerk, is refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs, despite court orders. She's being held in contempt. The article also mentions support from some Republican candidates.

Next, I'll identify the morally charged words the author used, like "break," "deny," "refusing," "contempt," "defy," etc. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by outlining the key events: Davis's refusal, court actions, her contempt, and the political support. I'll use the moral terms to convey her defiance and the consequences. Also, I'll mention the support from Huckabee, Paul, and Jindal, highlighting their stance against the law.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to first explain her actions, then the legal consequences, followed by the political backing, and the potential implications if she's jailed.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, using the moral language to emphasize the conflict between her beliefs and the law, as well as the broader implications for the political landscape.

SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis has defied federal court orders by refusing to issue marriage licenses, citing her religious beliefs, despite the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage. She has been hauled into court for contempt, as her refusal to comply with the law is seen as a flagrant defiance of the Constitution. Davis insists her authority comes from "Godâ€™s authority," which clashes with her oath to uphold the law. Her stance, which denies gay couples their rights, has been rejected by the courts, yet she persists in her illegal and morally dubious actions. Some Republican candidates, like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, have praised her defiance, viewing her as a hero for standing against "judicial tyranny." Others, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to resign. If Davis is punished harshly, including possible jail time, she could inspire further defiance, potentially fueling anti-gay discrimination. Her actions highlight the tension between religious beliefs and the law, with some using her case to motivate conservative support. END OF SUMMARY.
