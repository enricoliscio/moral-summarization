Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Kim Davis and her defiance of the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. She cited her religious beliefs and was ordered by the governor and a federal judge to comply, but she refused. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, and she's now facing contempt charges. Some Republican candidates, like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, have supported her stance, while others, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to step down or resign.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the provided morally framed words as possible. I need to make sure these words are integrated naturally into the summary without making it sound forced. Words like "break," "deny," "refusing," "ordered," "refused," "contempt," "punished," "rejected," "deny," "breaking," "defying," "abusing," "insisting," "stand," "discriminate," "motivate," "defiance," "tyranny," "thank," "defy," "championing," and "illegality" should be used where appropriate.

I'll start by outlining the key events: Davis's refusal to issue licenses, the legal actions against her, the Supreme Court's rejection, her contempt hearing, and the political support she's receiving. Then, I'll incorporate the moral language to highlight the ethical issues involved, such as breaking the law, denying rights, defying the Constitution, and the potential for inspiring others to defy the law.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words. So, I'll be concise but make sure each point is covered. I'll structure it to first explain Davis's actions, then the legal consequences, followed by the political reactions, and finally the implications of her defiance.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include the moral terms and keep it within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it flows naturally and that the moral framing is preserved without losing clarity.

After drafting, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and that the morally charged words are appropriately used. I'll also make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified.

SUMMARY: Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis has repeatedly refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs, despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to comply. Her defiance, which includes denying gay people their constitutionally protected rights, has led to a contempt of court hearing. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, yet she continues to break the law, defying the Constitution and abusing her authority. Davis’s stance, which she defends as being guided by "God’s authority," is seen as morally dubious and illegal. Her actions have inspired some conservative figures, including Republican presidential candidates like Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who have praised her defiance of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Huckabee called her a hero, while Paul and Jindal expressed support for her right to follow her conscience. However, others, like Carly Fiorina, have urged her to resign. The situation highlights the tension between religious beliefs and the law, with the possibility that harsh punishment for Davis could inspire further defiance and anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
