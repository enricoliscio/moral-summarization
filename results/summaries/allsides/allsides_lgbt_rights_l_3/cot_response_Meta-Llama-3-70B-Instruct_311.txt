SUMMARY:
Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis is set to appear in federal court to explain why she believes her personal convictions and God empower her to break the law and deny gay people their constitutionally protected rights. Despite being ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job, Davis has refused, citing her religious beliefs. Her morally dubious stand against gay marriage has appealed to conservative Republicans, including presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Bobby Jindal, who are cheering on her defiance of the Constitution. Huckabee has even called her a hero for standing up to "judicial tyranny." However, not all Republicans agree, with Carly Fiorina urging Davis to either give up or resign. The situation could escalate further if Davis is punished harshly, potentially inspiring others to defy the Constitution and champion brazen illegality in the service of anti-gay discrimination. END OF SUMMARY.
