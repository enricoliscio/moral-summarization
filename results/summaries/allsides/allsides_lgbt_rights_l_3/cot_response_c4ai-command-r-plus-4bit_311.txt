SUMMARY:
Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, is appearing in federal court to explain why she believes God and her personal convictions allow her to break the law and deny gay couples their legal right to marry. Davis has refused to issue marriage licenses to any couple, despite orders from the governor and a federal judge to do her job. She claims that her religious beliefs supersede the law, a stance that appeals to a segment of the conservative movement that wishes to discriminate against gay people under the guise of "godly virtue." Several Republican presidential candidates, including Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul, have supported Davis's defiance, cheering on her illegal and morally dubious actions. Davis's actions and the support she receives from certain political figures highlight a dangerous trend of brazen illegality and contempt for the Constitution. Davis could face punishment for her actions, but some worry that she may be perceived as a martyr and inspire others to defy the law. This situation underscores the complicated intersection of religious beliefs, personal convictions, and the law in the United States.
