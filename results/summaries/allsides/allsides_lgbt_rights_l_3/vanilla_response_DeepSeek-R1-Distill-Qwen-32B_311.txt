Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Kim Davis. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying that Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, is appearing in federal court. She's refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her religious beliefs, even after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. She was ordered by the governor and a federal judge to do her job but refused. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal, so she's now facing contempt of court charges.

The article criticizes her stance, saying she's defying the Constitution and abusing her authority. It also mentions that her actions are appealing to some conservatives and Republican candidates. Mike Huckabee praises her, calling her a hero against judicial tyranny. Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal also support her, though less enthusiastically. Some candidates, like Carly Fiorina, urge her to step down. The article ends by noting that if Davis is jailed, she might become a martyr, inspiring others to defy the law.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: her refusal to issue licenses, her religious beliefs, the court's rejection, the contempt charges, the support from certain politicians, and the potential consequences.

I'll start by introducing Kim Davis and her defiance. Mention the Supreme Court ruling, her refusal despite orders, and the contempt charges. Then, note the support from Huckabee, Paul, and Jindal, and the opposing view from Fiorina. Finally, touch on the possible impact if she's jailed.

Let me make sure I don't miss any important details. The article also mentions that her stance is part of a conservative movement and that some politicians are using her case for their campaigns. That's important context.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: her actions, legal context, political support, and potential implications. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's clear and covers all main points without going over 200 words.
