SUMMARY:

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is a deliberate attempt by Republicans to overturn Roe v. Wade. The law, engineered to be unconstitutionally severe, allows abortions only if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and is a politically-motivated attempt to restrict abortion care, which will disproportionately harm black and low-income people. The lawsuit claims that banning abortion will push care "further and further out of reach" and exploit people's health and lives for political gain. With over 350 abortion restrictions introduced this year, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are fighting to protect patients' lives and reproductive rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
