SUMMARY:

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which only allows abortions if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutional and will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up a significant portion of those seeking abortions in the state. The law was intentionally written to be severe in order to challenge the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide. This is just the first step in a long legal battle over the ban. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood argue that the law is part of a broader trend of states introducing abortion restrictions, with over 350 restrictions introduced so far this year.
