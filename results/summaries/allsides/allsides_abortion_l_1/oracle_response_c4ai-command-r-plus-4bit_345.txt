SUMMARY: Abortion rights advocates are fighting back against Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which is unconstitutionally severe and includes no exceptions for rape or incest. Republicans engineered this law to force a legal battle over Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed a lawsuit arguing that the law is blatantly unconstitutional and will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who already face significant barriers to accessing safe abortions. Alabama's ban is part of a disturbing trend of states pushing for extreme abortion restrictions, with over 350 introduced so far this year. Abortion providers in the state could spend up to 99 years in prison if the ban goes into effect, a harsh punishment that illustrates the severity of the law. Advocates have no choice but to fight through the courts to protect their patients' lives and ensure abortion remains legal in Alabama and across the nation.
