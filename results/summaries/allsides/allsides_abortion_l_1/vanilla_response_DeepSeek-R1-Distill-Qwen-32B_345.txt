Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the main points are that Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have sued Alabama over their near-total abortion ban. The law is really strict, only allowing abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. Republicans in Alabama wanted this law to be challenged so it could go to the Supreme Court and possibly overturn Roe v. Wade.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court, representing Planned Parenthood, three clinics, and a doctor. They argue the law is unconstitutional, specifically targeting the narrow exception and the disproportionate impact on black and low-income communities. The article also mentions that similar restrictive laws are being passed in other states, but none are in effect yet.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the lawsuit, then the law's details, the intent behind it, the plaintiffs, the arguments, and the broader context of other states' actions.

Let me make sure I include all key elements without getting too wordy. Also, I should end with the cover image description as it's part of the original article.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which prohibits abortions except in cases of serious health risk to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, imposes up to 99 years in prison for providers. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms Black and low-income communities, who make up most abortion seekers in Alabama. The plaintiffs include Planned Parenthood Southeast, Alabama’s abortion clinics, and a doctor. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood assert the law’s restrictions are medically unnecessary and politically motivated. This case is part of a broader trend, with states like Missouri and Georgia passing restrictive abortion laws, though none are yet in effect.  

END OF SUMMARY.
