Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over their near-total abortion ban. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions that the lawsuit was filed on Friday, which is the first step in a legal battle. Alabama's law only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. It seems the law is designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, as Republicans wanted to provoke a lawsuit. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are arguing that the law is unconstitutional and targets black and low-income communities disproportionately. They also mention that black individuals make up a large percentage of abortion seekers in Alabama despite being a smaller part of the population. The article also touches on other states passing similar restrictive laws, but none are in effect yet.

I should structure the summary to include the main elements: who filed the lawsuit, the specifics of Alabama's law, the purpose behind the law, the impact on vulnerable groups, and the broader context of other states' actions. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most critical points without getting too detailed.

I should start with the lawsuit, then explain Alabama's law, its intent to challenge Roe v. Wade, the groups affected, and mention other states' laws briefly. Make sure to highlight that the law is unconstitutional and the plaintiffs' stance. Keep the language clear and straightforward.

Let me draft it:

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, imposes severe penalties on providers. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately affects black and low-income communities. Black individuals make up 60% of abortion seekers in Alabama despite being less than a third of the population. Similar restrictive laws have been passed in other states, though none are yet in effect.

Wait, that's a bit short. Let me add more details about the plaintiffs and the broader context.

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which permits abortions only in cases of serious health risk to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, crafted to provoke a legal challenge to Roe v. Wade, imposes up to 99 years in prison for providers. The plaintiffs argue the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities, as black individuals make up 60% of abortion seekers in Alabama despite being less than a third of the population. This case is part of a broader trend, with several states passing restrictive abortion laws, though none are currently in effect.

That's better. It includes the lawsuit details, the law's specifics, its intent, the impact on specific groups, and the broader context. It's under 200 words and covers all key points.
