SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, engineered by Republicans to overturn Roe v. Wade, has sparked a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law, which allows abortions only if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, is deemed "blatantly unconstitutional" by the ACLU. The ban has no exceptions for rape or incest, and providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The ACLU argues that the law is tailored to be impossible to comply with and will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up a significant portion of those seeking abortions in the state. The lawsuit is a response to Alabama's years-long push to restrict abortions, which the ACLU calls "medically unnecessary" and "politically motivated." By filing the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are fighting to protect their patients' lives and pushing back against the state's anti-abortion agenda.

END OF SUMMARY.
