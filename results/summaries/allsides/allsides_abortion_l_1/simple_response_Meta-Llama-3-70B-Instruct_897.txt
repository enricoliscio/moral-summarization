SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, has been sued by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law, engineered by Republicans, has no exceptions for rape or incest and could lead to 99-year prison sentences for abortion providers. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and is a political move to overturn Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit highlights Alabama's history of restricting abortions and argues that the ban will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up a significant proportion of those seeking abortions in the state. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood vow to fight the ban through every channel, citing the need to protect patients' lives. This lawsuit is part of a larger trend, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year.

END OF SUMMARY.
