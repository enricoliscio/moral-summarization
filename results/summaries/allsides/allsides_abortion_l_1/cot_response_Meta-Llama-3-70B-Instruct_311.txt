SUMMARY:
Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, has been sued by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest and could lead to 99-year prison sentences for abortion providers. Republicans engineered the law to be "unconstitutionally severe" in order to challenge Roe v. Wade. The ACLU calls the law "blatantly unconstitutional" and argues that it will disproportionately harm black and low-income people. The lawsuit claims that banning abortion will push care "further and further out of reach" and that Alabama's attempts to restrict abortions are "medically unnecessary" and "politically-motivated". This law is part of a larger trend, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year. END OF SUMMARY.
