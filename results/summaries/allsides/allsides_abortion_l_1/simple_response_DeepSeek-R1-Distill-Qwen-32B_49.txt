Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over their abortion ban. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the key points and the underlying moral arguments.

First, the article mentions that Alabama passed a near-total abortion ban, which only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk. There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The Republicans designed the law to challenge Roe v. Wade, hoping it would be used to overturn the precedent.

The lawsuit was filed by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, arguing the law is unconstitutional. They point out that the "serious health risk" exception is too narrow and impossible to meet. They also highlight that the ban disproportionately affects black and low-income communities, as these groups make up a majority of abortion patients in Alabama.

The article also quotes Leana Wen from Planned Parenthood, emphasizing that they have no choice but to fight through the courts to protect their patients' lives. Additionally, it notes that many states have introduced strict abortion laws this year, but none are currently in effect.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral stance against the law, the intention behind it, and the impact on vulnerable communities. I'll structure it to include the lawsuit, the law's provisions, the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood's arguments, the disproportionate impact, and the broader context of state-level abortion restrictions.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well. I'll start with the lawsuit, explain the law, the Republican strategy, the ACLU's argument, the impact on marginalized groups, and the broader state actions. That should cover the main points while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade. The law allows abortions only in cases of serious health risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and imposes harsh penalties on providers. Alabama Republicans crafted the law to provoke a legal challenge, aiming to overturn abortion rights nationwide. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional, with the "serious health risk" exception too narrow to comply with. It also highlights the disproportionate impact on black and low-income communities, who make up the majority of abortion patients in Alabama. Leana Wen of Planned Parenthood emphasized the necessity of fighting through the courts to protect patients' lives. This case is part of a broader trend, with states introducing over 350 abortion restrictions this year, though none are currently in effect. END OF SUMMARY.
