SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, marking the first step in a long legal battle to block the law from taking effect. The ban, which only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, seeks to challenge Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. The ACLU argues that the law is unconstitutionally severe and that the "serious health risk" exception is impossible to comply with. The lawsuit also highlights the disproportionate impact the ban would have on black and low-income individuals, who make up a significant proportion of those seeking abortions in Alabama. This lawsuit is a response to the increasing efforts by state legislatures to restrict abortion access, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced so far this year. The Alabama ban is part of a larger trend of restrictive abortion laws passed in states like Missouri and Georgia, spurring nationwide protests.
