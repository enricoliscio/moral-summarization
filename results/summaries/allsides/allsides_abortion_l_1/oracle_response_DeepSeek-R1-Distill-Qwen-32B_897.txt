Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's needed. They provided a news article about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over their near-total abortion ban. The user emphasized preserving the moral words the author used, which are listed.

First, I need to identify the key points of the article. The main points are the lawsuit, the specifics of Alabama's law, the intention behind the law, the impact on marginalized groups, and the broader context of state abortion restrictions.

I should start by mentioning the lawsuit and the parties involved. Then, explain the law's provisions, like the "serious health risk" exception and the lack of exceptions for rape and incest. It's important to highlight that the law was engineered to challenge Roe v. Wade.

Next, I need to include the ACLU's argument about the law being unconstitutional and the impact on black and low-income communities. The statistics about the population and abortion rates are crucial here.

Also, including Leana Wen's quote about fighting through all channels adds a strong moral stance. Lastly, mentioning the broader trend of state restrictions sets the context.

I should make sure to use as many of the morally framed words as possible without making the summary too long. Keeping it under 200 words is essential. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the lawsuit, the law's specifics, the ACLU's arguments, the impact on specific groups, and the broader implications.

Let me draft this, ensuring each key point is covered succinctly and the moral language is preserved. I'll avoid adding any extra information not present in the article. Once done, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which prohibits abortions except in cases of a "serious health risk" to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, imposes severe penalties on providers, including up to 99 years in prison. The ACLU argues the law is unconstitutional and politically motivated, with Alabama Republicans engineering it to force a legal challenge. The lawsuit highlights how the law disproportionately harms black and low-income communities, as black individuals make up over 60% of abortion patients in Alabama, despite being less than a third of the population. The plaintiffs, including Planned Parenthood Southeast and an abortion provider, argue the lawâ€™s restrictions are medically unnecessary and impossible to comply with. Leana Wen of Planned Parenthood emphasized the necessity of fighting the ban to protect patients' lives, stating they have no choice but to sue. The case is part of a broader trend of state-level abortion restrictions, with over 350 introduced this year, though none have taken effect yet. END OF SUMMARY.
