Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given me a detailed query, so I should break it down step by step.

First, the user wants me to identify all the morally framed single words in the article. They mentioned that this is step one, so I need to go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "ban," "unconstitutional," "emboldened," "exploit," "disproportionately," "oppress," "oppressing," "oppressed," "extreme," "outrage," "oppression," "fight," "right," "oppress," "oppressing," "oppressed," "extreme," "outrage," "oppression," "fight," "right," "oppress," "oppressing," "oppressed," "extreme," "outrage," "oppression," "fight," "right." Wait, I think I might be repeating some here. I should list each word only once, even if it appears multiple times.

Next, the user wants a summary that includes as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should make sure to include the key points: the lawsuit against Alabama's abortion ban, the intention to challenge Roe v. Wade, the impact on marginalized groups, and the ongoing legal battles.

I also need to structure the response with STEP 1 listing each word, each on a new line starting with an asterisk. Then, after that, the SUMMARY section should encapsulate the main points using those words where appropriate.

I should ensure that the summary is clear and captures the moral stance presented in the original article, highlighting the opposition to the ban and the legal strategies involved. It's important to mention the disproportionate impact on black and low-income communities, as that's a significant moral angle.

I need to be careful not to exceed the word limit, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive. I'll make sure to include the key players like Planned Parenthood, ACLU, and the political motivations behind the law.

Finally, I'll end the summary with "END OF SUMMARY." as instructed. I should review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the moral framing from the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama’s near-total abortion ban, which was designed to challenge Roe v. Wade. The law allows abortions only in cases of serious health risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and imposes severe penalties on providers. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood argue the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms Black and low-income communities, who make up the majority of abortion seekers in Alabama. The lawsuit highlights Alabama’s long history of restrictive abortion policies and the political motivation behind the ban. Activists emphasize the need to fight through all channels to protect reproductive rights, as similar restrictive laws have been introduced nationwide. The legal battle underscores the ongoing conflict over abortion access and its impact on marginalized groups. END OF SUMMARY.
