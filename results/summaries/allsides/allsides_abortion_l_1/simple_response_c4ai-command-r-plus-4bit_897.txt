SUMMARY: Alabama Republicans have passed a near-total abortion ban, which is now being challenged in court by the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. The ban only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk and imposes harsh penalties on providers, including lengthy prison sentences. The law is intentionally designed to be blatantly unconstitutional, with the explicit goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit argues that the ban is medically unnecessary, politically motivated, and disproportionately harms black and low-income individuals. The plaintiffs maintain that they have no choice but to file the lawsuit to protect their patients' lives and rights. This lawsuit is part of a broader trend of state legislatures introducing and passing restrictive abortion laws, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced so far this year.
