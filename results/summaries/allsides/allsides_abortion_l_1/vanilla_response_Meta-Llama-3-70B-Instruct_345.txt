SUMMARY:

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which only allows abortions if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutional and will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up a large percentage of those who get abortions in the state. The law was intentionally designed to be challenged in court, with the ultimate goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. This is part of a larger trend, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year. The lawsuit is the first step in a long legal battle over the ban.

END OF SUMMARY.
