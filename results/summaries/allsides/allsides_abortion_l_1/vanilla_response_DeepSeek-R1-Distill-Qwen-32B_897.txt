Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is really strict, only allowing abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. 

The article mentions that Republicans in Alabama wanted this lawsuit to happen because they're trying to overturn Roe v. Wade. They engineered the law to be unconstitutional on purpose. The lawsuit was filed in federal court, representing Planned Parenthood, three clinics, and a doctor. The ACLU argues that the law is unconstitutional and targets black and low-income communities, who make up most of the abortion patients in Alabama.

There's also mention of other states introducing similar restrictive laws, but none are in effect yet. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should include the key points: who filed the lawsuit, the nature of the Alabama law, the intention behind it, the impact on vulnerable groups, and the broader context of other states' actions.

I should structure it to first state that the lawsuit was filed, then explain the law's provisions, the political motive, the plaintiffs, the ACLU's arguments, the demographic impact, and the nationwide context of restrictive laws. I need to make sure it's clear and within the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I go. Start with the main action: lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and ACLU against Alabama's abortion ban. Then describe the law's restrictions. Mention the intention to challenge Roe v. Wade. Include the plaintiffs and the ACLU's stance on the law's constitutionality. Highlight the disproportionate impact on black and low-income communities. Conclude with other states' similar laws but not yet in effect. Keep it tight and informative without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which restricts abortions to cases of serious health risk to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, imposes severe penalties on providers. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of abortion clinics and a doctor, argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities. The plaintiffs highlight Alabama's history of restrictive abortion laws and the law's narrow exceptions. The case is part of a broader trend, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced nationwide this year, though none are currently in effect.  

END OF SUMMARY.
