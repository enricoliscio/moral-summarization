SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, has been sued by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest and could imprison abortion providers for up to 99 years. Republicans engineered the law to be unconstitutional, aiming to overturn Roe v. Wade. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and exploits women's health for political gain. The lawsuit highlights Alabama's history of restricting abortions, which disproportionately harm black and low-income people. With over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year, the battle over abortion rights is far from over.

END OF SUMMARY.
