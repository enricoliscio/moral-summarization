Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is so strict that it only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The Republicans designed the law to be unconstitutional, hoping it would challenge Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional, disproportionately affects black and low-income people, and is part of a broader trend of restrictive abortion laws across the U.S.

I need to capture the key points: the lawsuit, the strictness of the law, the Republican strategy, the ACLU's stance, the impact on vulnerable groups, and the broader context of state restrictions. Also, the moral framing emphasizes the fight for reproductive rights and justice.

I should structure the summary to include the lawsuit, the law's provisions, the strategic move by Republicans, the ACLU's argument, the disproportionate impact, and the nationwide trend. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspective is clear.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which restricts abortions to cases of serious health risk to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, imposes severe penalties on providers, including up to 99 years in prison. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms Black and low-income communities, as these groups make up a majority of abortion seekers in Alabama. The plaintiffs, including abortion clinics and a doctor, aim to prevent the law from taking effect. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood emphasize the lawâ€™s medically unnecessary restrictions and its role in a broader national trend of restrictive abortion laws. The suit highlights the moral imperative to protect reproductive rights and opposes political exploitation of health and lives for anti-abortion agendas. END OF SUMMARY.
