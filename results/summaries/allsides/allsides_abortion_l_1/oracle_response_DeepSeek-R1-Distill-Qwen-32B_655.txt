Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I'll start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is so strict that it only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The Republicans in Alabama intentionally made the law severe to provoke a lawsuit, aiming to overturn Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms black and low-income individuals.

I need to make sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible without making the summary too long. I should focus on the key elements: the lawsuit, the strictness of the law, the absence of exceptions, the potential prison time, the Republican strategy, the constitutional challenge, and the impact on vulnerable groups.

I'll structure the summary to mention the lawsuit, the law's provisions, the Republican intent, the ACLU's stance, the disproportionate harm, and the ongoing legal battle. I'll use words like "ban," "exceptions," "rape," "incest," "engineered," "unconstitutional," "restrict," "harm," etc., to maintain the moral framing.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and under 200 words. I'll check to include all the necessary points and the specified moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which prohibits abortions except in cases of serious health risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to provoke a legal challenge, aims to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. Abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The ACLU argues the law is *unconstitutional* and *politically motivated*, with the "serious health risk" exception too narrow to comply with. The lawsuit highlights that banning abortion would *disproportionately harm* Black and low-income communities, as they make up the majority of abortion seekers in Alabama. The plaintiffs, including Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics, emphasize that fighting the ban is about protecting patients' lives, not just legal battles. This case is part of a broader trend of state legislatures introducing strict abortion *restrictions*, with similar laws passed in Missouri and Georgia, though none are yet in effect. The ACLU vows to *stand* against laws that *exploit* health and lives for political gain. END OF SUMMARY.
