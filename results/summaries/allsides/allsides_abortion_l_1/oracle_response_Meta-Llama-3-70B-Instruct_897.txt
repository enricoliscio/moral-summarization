SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, engineered by Republicans to overturn Roe v. Wade, has sparked a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law, which poses a "serious health risk" to mothers, has no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion providers could spend up to 99 years in prison. This unconstitutional ban is a politically-motivated attempt to push abortion care out of reach, exploiting people's health and lives for political gain. The ACLU argues that the law will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up a significant proportion of those seeking abortions in the state. The lawsuit is a necessary fight to protect patients' lives and push back against the anti-abortion agenda. With over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year, this legal battle is just the beginning.

END OF SUMMARY.
