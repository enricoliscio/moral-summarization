SUMMARY: Abortion rights advocates are fighting back against Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which is unconstitutionally severe and includes no exceptions for rape or incest. Republicans engineered the law to restrict abortion access and push their anti-abortion agenda, with abortion providers facing up to 99 years in prison for performing the procedure. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed a lawsuit arguing that the law is blatantly unconstitutional and will disproportionately harm black and low-income people. This is just the latest in a series of abortion restrictions introduced by state legislatures across the country, with over 350 restrictions proposed so far this year. Abortion rights advocates have no choice but to fight through the legal system to protect their patients' lives and ensure abortion remains legal.

END OF SUMMARY.
