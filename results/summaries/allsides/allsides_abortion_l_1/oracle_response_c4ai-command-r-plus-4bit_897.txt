SUMMARY: Abortion rights advocates are fighting back against Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which is unconstitutionally severe and engineered to restrict abortion access. The ban includes no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion providers could face harsh penalties, including lengthy prison sentences. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed a lawsuit, arguing that the ban is medically unnecessary, politically motivated, and disproportionately harms black and low-income individuals. This lawsuit is a critical step in pushing back against the Alabama legislature's attempts to push their anti-abortion agenda and restrict abortion access. It is a battle that advocates have no choice but to fight, to protect the health and lives of those who need access to safe and legal abortions. The lawsuit also highlights the recent trend of states introducing and passing restrictive abortion laws, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced so far this year. These actions threaten to overturn Roe v. Wade and exploit vulnerable communities for political gain.

END OF SUMMARY.
