SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which is the first step in a long legal battle to determine if the ban will be allowed to take effect. The Alabama law imposes harsh penalties on abortion providers, with backers aiming to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. The ACLU argues that the law is blatantly unconstitutional and that the narrow exception for "serious health risks" is impossible to comply with. The lawsuit also highlights the disproportionate impact the ban would have on black and low-income individuals, who account for a significant proportion of those seeking abortions in the state. This legal challenge is a necessary step to protect patients' lives and ensure access to safe and legal abortions, despite playing into the hands of anti-abortion activists. This year has seen a surge in abortion restrictions across the US, with over 350 introduced thus far.
END OF SUMMARY.
