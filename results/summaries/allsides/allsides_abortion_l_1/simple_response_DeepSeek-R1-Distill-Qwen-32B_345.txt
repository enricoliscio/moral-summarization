Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The Republicans wanted this to happen so that it could challenge Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately affects black and low-income people. The plaintiffs include Planned Parenthood, abortion clinics, and a doctor. They're fighting to protect their patients' lives, and there's a broader context of many states introducing abortion restrictions.

Now, the user wants a summary under 200 words, ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also want the moral framing preserved, so I need to highlight the ethical issues, like the impact on vulnerable groups and the challenge to Roe v. Wade.

I should structure the summary to include the lawsuit details, the law's strictness, the Republican strategy, the ACLU's argument about unconstitutionality, the disproportionate impact, and the broader context of state restrictions.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and captures all these points concisely. Let me start drafting.

First sentence: Introduce the lawsuit and the law. Then mention the Republican strategy. Next, the ACLU's argument and the impact on marginalized groups. Finally, the broader context of other states' actions.

Let me check the word count as I go to stay under 200. Also, ensure that the moral aspects are clear, like the harm to black and low-income communities and the threat to Roe v. Wade.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure each key point is included succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which restricts abortions to cases where the mother’s health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, could lead to up to 99 years in prison for providers. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities, who make up a majority of abortion seekers in Alabama. The plaintiffs, including Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics, emphasize the law’s medically unnecessary and politically motivated nature. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood vow to fight the ban through all channels, as similar restrictive laws have been introduced in other states this year. The case highlights the ongoing battle over abortion rights and its impact on vulnerable populations.  
END OF SUMMARY.
