SUMMARY: Alabama Republicans have passed a near-total abortion ban that is unconstitutionally severe, with the explicit intention of forcing abortion rights advocates to sue. The ban includes no exceptions for rape or incest and carries harsh penalties for abortion providers. This is the latest in a series of attempts by Alabama to restrict abortion access and the first step in what is expected to be a long legal battle. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed a lawsuit against the state, arguing that the ban is blatantly unconstitutional and will disproportionately harm black and low-income individuals. They also assert that the "serious health risk" exception is impossibly narrow to comply with. This lawsuit is a necessary fight, according to abortion rights activists, who are also battling over 350 other abortion restrictions introduced across state legislatures this year, including several early abortion bans. Abortion remains legal in every state, and activists are committed to fighting through all channels to protect reproductive freedom. END OF SUMMARY.
