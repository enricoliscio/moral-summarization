SUMMARY:

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which only allows abortions if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. Republicans engineered the law to be unconstitutional, hoping to force a legal battle that could ultimately overturn Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutional and will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up a majority of those seeking abortions in the state. This is the latest in a series of abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year, with over 350 restrictions proposed. While none of these laws are currently in effect, abortion remains legal in every state.

END OF SUMMARY.
