SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama's near-total abortion ban, marking the first step in a long legal battle over the law's constitutionality. The law criminalizes abortion, with exceptions only for cases where the mother's health is at serious risk, and carries harsh penalties for abortion providers. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutionally severe and that the "serious health risk" exception is impossible to comply with. It also highlights the disproportionate impact the ban would have on black and low-income communities, who make up a significant portion of abortion patients in the state. The legal challenge is exactly what Alabama Republicans intended, as they hope to use the law as a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. While anti-abortion activists have introduced hundreds of restrictive laws across the country this year, abortion remains legal in all states, and advocates vow to fight through the courts to protect reproductive rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
