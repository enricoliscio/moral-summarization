SUMMARY:
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is a "blatantly unconstitutional" law that would only allow abortions if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest and could lead to up to 99 years in prison for abortion providers. Republicans engineered the law to be "unconstitutionally severe" in order to force abortion rights advocates to sue, with the ultimate goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. The ACLU argues that the law is part of a larger trend of "medically unnecessary and politically-motivated restrictions" that have been pushed by Alabama Republicans. The lawsuit also highlights the disproportionate harm the ban would cause to black and low-income people, who make up a significant portion of those seeking abortions in the state. END OF SUMMARY.
