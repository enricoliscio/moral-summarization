SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, has been sued by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest and imposes harsh penalties on abortion providers. Republicans engineered the law to be unconstitutional, hoping to overturn Roe v. Wade. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up a significant proportion of those seeking abortions in Alabama. This lawsuit is part of a larger battle, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are fighting to protect women's lives and health, and to ensure that abortion remains legal and accessible.

END OF SUMMARY.
