SUMMARY:

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother. The law has no exceptions for rape or incest and could lead to 99-year prison sentences for abortion providers. Republicans engineered the law to be unconstitutional, hoping to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutional, will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, and is part of a larger trend of abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year. Alabama's law is one of several recent laws regulating abortion, including Missouri's ban after eight weeks and Georgia's "heartbeat" bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
