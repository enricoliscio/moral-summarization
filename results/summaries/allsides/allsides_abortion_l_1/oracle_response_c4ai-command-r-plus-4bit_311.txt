SUMMARY: Abortion rights advocates have filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is unconstitutionally severe and engineered to push the legal envelope. The law only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk and imposes harsh penalties on providers, with no exceptions for rape or incest. This ban disproportionately harms black and low-income people and is part of a wider trend of restricting abortion access. Republicans wanted abortion rights activists to sue, as they seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit argues that the "serious health risk" exception is impossible to comply with and that the ban is politically motivated. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood highlight Alabama's history of restricting abortions and the harm this would cause to vulnerable communities. With similar laws passed in other states, abortion rights activists have no choice but to fight through the courts to protect patients' lives and rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
