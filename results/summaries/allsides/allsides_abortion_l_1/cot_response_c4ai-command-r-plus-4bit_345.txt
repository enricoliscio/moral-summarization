SUMMARY: 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, kicking off a long legal battle. Republicans wanted this: they engineered the law to be unconstitutionally severe, hoping to force abortion advocates to sue and ultimately overturn Roe v. Wade. The ACLU argues that Alabama has a long history of restricting abortions and that the ban will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, who make up over 60% of those seeking abortions in the state. While abortion remains legal in every state, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood have no choice but to fight through every channel, as state legislatures continue to introduce and pass harmful restrictions. 
END OF SUMMARY.
