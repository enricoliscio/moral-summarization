Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is strict, allowing abortions only if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The penalty for providers is up to 99 years in prison. The Republicans designed the law to challenge Roe v. Wade.

I notice the moral framing words like "near-total abortion ban," "extreme," "unconstitutional," "anti-abortion," "exploit," "disproportionately harm," "low-income," and "protests." These words convey the ethical concerns and the opposition's stance.

The summary should include these terms to maintain the moral perspective. I'll structure it to highlight the lawsuit, the law's severity, the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade, the impact on marginalized groups, and the broader context of state restrictions. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, ensuring all key points are covered with the moral language intact.

The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, imposes severe penalties on providers. Critics argue it is unconstitutionally extreme and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities. The lawsuit highlights Alabama’s long history of anti-abortion restrictions and the law’s severe impact on marginalized groups. The legal battle reflects a broader national trend of state legislatures introducing strict abortion restrictions, with several states passing early abortion bans. Protests nationwide have erupted in response to these laws, underscoring the ongoing conflict over reproductive rights. END OF SUMMARY.
