SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, is being sued by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law, engineered by Republicans to be unconstitutionally severe, has no exceptions for rape or incest and could lead to 99 years in prison for abortion providers. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and that politicians are "exploiting" people's health and lives for political gain. The lawsuit claims that the ban will disproportionately "harm" black and low-income people, who make up a significant portion of those seeking abortions in the state. This law is part of a larger trend, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are fighting the ban, saying they have "no choice" but to take a stand and fight for their patients' lives.

END OF SUMMARY.
