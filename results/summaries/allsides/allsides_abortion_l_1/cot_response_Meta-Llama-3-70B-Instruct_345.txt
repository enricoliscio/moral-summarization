SUMMARY:
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is intentionally "extreme" and "unconstitutionally severe" to force a legal battle over Roe v. Wade. The law allows abortions only if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and is part of a broader "anti-abortion agenda" that will "disproportionately harm" black and low-income people. The lawsuit claims that Alabama's restrictions have been pushing abortion care "further and further out of reach" for years. This is just one of over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year, sparking protests nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
