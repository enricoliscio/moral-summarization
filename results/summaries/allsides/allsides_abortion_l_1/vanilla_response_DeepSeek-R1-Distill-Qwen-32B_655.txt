Alright, so I need to summarize this article about Alabama's abortion ban and the lawsuit against it. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the article says that Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The Republicans in Alabama wanted this to happen, hoping it would lead to a legal challenge to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. district court, representing Planned Parenthood, three clinics, and a doctor. The ACLU argues the law is unconstitutional and that the exception is too narrow. They also mention that the ban would disproportionately affect black and low-income communities since they make up a significant portion of abortion patients in Alabama.

There's also a quote from Leana Wen, who says they have no choice but to sue because it's about their patients' lives. The article mentions that many states have introduced abortion restrictions this year, but none are currently in effect, so abortion is still legal everywhere.

I need to condense all this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: who sued, the nature of the law, the Republican strategy, the lawsuit's arguments, the impact on vulnerable groups, and the broader context of state restrictions.

I should make sure to include the key details without getting too bogged down in specifics. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each important point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to provoke a legal challenge, aims to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court, argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities, who make up a majority of abortion patients in Alabama. The plaintiffs include Planned Parenthood Southeast, Alabama’s abortion clinics, and a doctor. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood assert the law’s narrow exception is unenforceable and that it exploits health and lives for political gain. Leana Wen of Planned Parenthood emphasized the necessity of fighting through legal channels to protect patients’ lives. This case follows a wave of state abortion restrictions, with none currently in effect, keeping abortion legal nationwide.  
END OF SUMMARY.
