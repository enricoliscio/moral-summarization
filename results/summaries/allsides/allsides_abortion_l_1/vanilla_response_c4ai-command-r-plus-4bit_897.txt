SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is the first step in a long legal battle to determine if the ban can be implemented. Alabama's law would only allow abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk and imposes harsh penalties on providers. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutionally severe and that the "serious health risk" exception is impossible to comply with. It also highlights the disproportionate impact the ban would have on black and low-income individuals, who make up a significant proportion of those seeking abortions in the state. While anti-abortion activists have intentionally engineered the law to spark a lawsuit in hopes of overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion rights advocates emphasize the urgent need to fight for their patients' lives through legal action. This lawsuit is a response to Alabama's ongoing efforts to restrict abortion access and is part of a broader trend of increasing abortion restrictions across the US.
END OF SUMMARY.
