SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is the first step in a long legal battle to determine if the ban will be implemented. Alabama's law only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk and imposes harsh penalties on providers. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutionally severe and that the exception is too narrow to comply with. It also highlights the disproportionate impact on black and low-income communities. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood assert that the ban is part of Alabama's ongoing effort to restrict abortion access. The suit is the latest in a series of legal challenges to similar laws passed in other states, with abortion rights advocates committed to fighting these bans through all available channels.
END OF SUMMARY.
