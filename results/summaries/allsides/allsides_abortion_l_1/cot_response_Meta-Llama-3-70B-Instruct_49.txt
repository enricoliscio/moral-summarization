SUMMARY:
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is intentionally designed to be "extreme" and "unconstitutionally severe". The law, backed by Republicans, allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. Critics argue that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and designed to overturn Roe v. Wade. The ACLU claims that Alabama's law is part of a broader "anti-abortion agenda" that will "harm" and "disproportionately affect" black and low-income people. The lawsuit argues that the law is "medically unnecessary" and "politically motivated", and that banning abortion will have devastating consequences for women's lives. END OF SUMMARY.
