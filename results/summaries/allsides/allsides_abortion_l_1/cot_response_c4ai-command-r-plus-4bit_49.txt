SUMMARY:
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban. This move was expected and welcomed by Alabama Republicans as it sets the stage for a protracted legal battle aimed at overturning Roe v. Wade. The Alabama law, which criminalizes abortion except when the mother's health is at serious risk, is deliberately unconstitutionally severe. Republicans engineered this law to force abortion rights advocates to sue and challenge the longstanding legalization of abortion. The ACLU decries the exploitative nature of the law, highlighting Alabama's history of restricting abortions and the disproportionate harm the ban will inflict on black and low-income communities. Despite the daunting odds, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU remain resolute in their fight, filing lawsuits and challenging the immoral restrictions on abortion rights through legal, legislative, and democratic channels. So far this year, over 350 abortion restrictions have been introduced across state legislatures, with several states passing laws that severely limit abortion access. These recent developments in Alabama, Missouri, and other states have spurred nationwide protests, underscoring the contentious nature of the abortion debate.
