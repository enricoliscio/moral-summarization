SUMMARY: 
Alabama's near-total abortion ban has sparked a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, marking the first step in a lengthy legal battle. The law, intentionally engineered by Republicans to be unconstitutionally severe, seeks to force abortion rights advocates to sue and ultimately aims to overturn Roe v. Wade. With no exceptions for rape or incest and harsh penalties for providers, the ban endangers women's health and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities. Abortion providers and supporters are left with no choice but to fight through legal channels, challenging the harmful restrictions in court. The lawsuit exposes Alabama's long history of attempting to restrict abortion access and highlights the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. This year alone, over 350 abortion restrictions have been introduced across state legislatures, threatening the fundamental right to choose.
