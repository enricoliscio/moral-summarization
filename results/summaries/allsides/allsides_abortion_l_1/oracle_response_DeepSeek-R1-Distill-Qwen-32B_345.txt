Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is strict, allowing abortions only if there's a serious health risk to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The Republicans in Alabama designed the law to be unconstitutional, hoping it would lead to a court challenge to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The lawsuit mentions that the law disproportionately affects black and low-income individuals, as they make up a large percentage of abortion patients in Alabama. The plaintiffs argue the law is unconstitutional and that the restrictions are unnecessary and politically motivated. They also point out that the "serious health risk" exception is too narrow to comply with.

The article also notes that this is part of a broader trend where states are introducing many abortion restrictions this year. The fight is happening on multiple frontsâ€”legislatures, courts, and ballots.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: risk, exceptions, rape, incest, spend, engineered, wanted, used, overturn, pushing, unnecessary, politicallymotivated, ban, push, unconstitutional, stand, emboldened, exploit, gain, restrict, tailored, impossible, banning, harm, choice, fight, restrictions.

I should structure the summary to include the lawsuit, the strictness of the law, the Republican strategy, the impact on vulnerable groups, and the broader context of state actions. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral language is preserved.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to be unconstitutionally severe, aims to challenge Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional, politically motivated, and disproportionately harms black and low-income individuals. The plaintiffs, including abortion clinics and a doctor, contend the "serious health risk" exception is impossible to meet. The ban, part of a broader trend of restrictive abortion laws, is seen as an attempt to exploit health and lives for political gain. The fight to protect abortion rights continues across legislative, judicial, and electoral fronts. END OF SUMMARY.
