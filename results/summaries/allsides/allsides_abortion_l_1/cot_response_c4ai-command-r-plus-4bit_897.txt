SUMMARY: 
Alabama Republicans have passed a near-total abortion ban, with severe consequences for abortion providers, including up to 99 years in prison. This law is a deliberate attempt to force abortion rights advocates to sue and challenge Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed a lawsuit against Alabama, arguing that the law is unconstitutionally restrictive and disproportionately harms black and low-income people. While Alabama Republicans wanted to provoke a legal battle, Planned Parenthood asserts they have no choice but to fight through the courts to protect their patients' lives. This year, state legislatures across the country have introduced and passed numerous abortion restrictions and bans, emboldened by an anti-abortion political agenda. These actions threaten to overturn decades of legal abortion and harm the most vulnerable communities.
