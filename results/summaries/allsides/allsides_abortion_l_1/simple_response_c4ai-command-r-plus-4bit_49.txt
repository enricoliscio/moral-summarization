SUMMARY: Alabama Republicans passed a near-total abortion ban, which Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are now suing over. This was expected and is the first step in a long legal battle to uphold the moral right to bodily autonomy and protect women's access to safe abortions. The Alabama law is a severe attack on reproductive rights, with abortion providers facing lengthy prison sentences. The ACLU rightly calls out the law as a blatant attempt to exploit women's health for political gain, and the lawsuit argues that it will disproportionately harm black and low-income people, further exacerbating existing inequalities. This is part of a wider trend of state legislatures introducing hundreds of abortion restrictions this year alone, with Missouri passing a ban on abortion after eight weeks, and four other states banning abortion as early as six weeks. These laws endanger women's lives and must be challenged at every turn, as Planned Parenthood's president Leana Wen affirms, stating that lawsuits and political activism are necessary to protect patients' lives. 

END OF SUMMARY.
