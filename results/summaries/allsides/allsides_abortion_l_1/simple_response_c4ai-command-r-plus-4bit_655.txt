SUMMARY: Alabama Republicans passed a law banning abortion in nearly all cases, with the deliberate intention of forcing a lawsuit from abortion rights advocates and creating a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have now sued Alabama over the near-total abortion ban, arguing that the law is blatantly unconstitutional and that it disproportionately harms black and low-income people. This lawsuit is a necessary step to protect patients' lives and fight against politically-motivated restrictions on abortion care, according to Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. So far this year, state legislatures across the US have introduced more than 350 abortion restrictions, with several states passing laws that ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. These recent laws regulating abortion have sparked protests nationwide.
END OF SUMMARY.
