SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, has sparked a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law, engineered by Republicans, has no exceptions for rape or incest and could lead to 99-year prison sentences for abortion providers. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and is part of a broader effort to restrict access to abortion care, particularly for black and low-income people who are disproportionately affected. The lawsuit is the first step in a long legal battle over the ban, which is intended to challenge the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. By filing the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU are fighting to protect the lives and health of their patients, and to push back against the anti-abortion agenda of politicians emboldened by President Trump.
