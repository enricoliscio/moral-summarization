Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is strict, allowing abortions only if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The article mentions that Republicans designed the law to challenge Roe v. Wade, knowing it would likely be unconstitutional.

There are quotes from Alexa Kolbi-Molinas and Leana Wen, emphasizing the unconstitutionality and the disproportionate impact on black and low-income communities. The lawsuit is filed on behalf of clinics and a doctor, arguing the law is too narrow and harmful. It also notes that other states are introducing similar restrictive laws, but none are currently in effect.

I need to capture the moral aspects: the fight for reproductive rights, the impact on vulnerable communities, and the legal strategy to challenge Roe v. Wade. I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the lawsuit details, the law's strictness, the plaintiffs, and the broader context of state actions.

I'll structure the summary by first stating the lawsuit, then the law's specifics, the Republican intent, the ACLU's stance, the impact on marginalized groups, and the broader state actions. I'll ensure it's clear and preserves the moral framing about protecting reproductive rights and opposing unconstitutional laws.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which Republicans designed to challenge Roe v. Wade. The law allows abortions only if a pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and imposes severe penalties on providers. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms Black and low-income communities, as these groups make up the majority of abortion seekers in Alabama. The plaintiffs include abortion clinics and a doctor, asserting the law's narrow exceptions are impossible to meet. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood emphasize the law's politically motivated nature and its threat to reproductive rights. This case is part of a broader trend, with states introducing over 350 abortion restrictions this year, though none have taken effect yet. The fight reflects a moral commitment to protecting access to abortion and challenging anti-abortion agendas.  
END OF SUMMARY.
