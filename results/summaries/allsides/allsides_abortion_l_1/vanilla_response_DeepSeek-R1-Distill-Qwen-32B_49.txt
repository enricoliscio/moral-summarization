Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is really strict, only allowing abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk, no exceptions for rape or incest, and providers could face up to 99 years in prison. 

Hmm, the key here is that Alabama Republicans intentionally made the law extreme to challenge Roe v. Wade. They wanted the ban to be sued so it could go to the Supreme Court. The lawsuit mentions the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately affects black and low-income communities. 

I should also note the statistics: black people make up less than a third of Alabama's population but over 60% of abortion patients. Plus, the Guttmacher Institute's count of over 350 abortion restrictions this year, and other states like Missouri and Georgia passing similar laws.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll start with the lawsuit, mention the law's details, the political intent, the impact on vulnerable groups, and the broader context of other states' actions. Make sure to highlight the ACLU and Planned Parenthood's stance against the law. 

Wait, I should also include that the lawsuit was filed in federal court and the plaintiffs involved. Maybe mention the president's anti-abortion agenda as a motivator. 

I need to keep it clear and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details. Let me structure it step by step: introduce the lawsuit, explain the law's provisions, the intent behind it, the plaintiffs, the legal arguments, the demographic impact, and the broader state context. 

Okay, I think that covers all the main points. Time to put it together in a concise summary.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which allows abortions only if the mother's health is at serious risk, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, imposes severe penalties on providers, including up to 99 years in prison. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, argues the law is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities, who make up the majority of abortion patients in Alabama. The plaintiffs include Planned Parenthood Southeast, Alabama’s abortion clinics, and a doctor. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood aim to stop the law from taking effect, emphasizing that it reflects Alabama’s long history of politically motivated restrictions. Similar restrictive laws have been introduced in other states, but none are currently in effect. The fight over abortion rights continues to unfold nationwide.
