SUMMARY:
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have sued Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which is intentionally "extreme" and "unconstitutionally severe". The law, backed by Republicans, allows abortions only if the pregnancy poses a "serious health risk" to the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Abortion providers could face up to 99 years in prison. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and is designed to overturn Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit claims that the ban will "disproportionately harm" black and low-income people, who make up a majority of those seeking abortions in the state. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood vow to fight the law through every channel, citing the need to protect their patients' lives. This lawsuit is part of a larger battle, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year. END OF SUMMARY.
