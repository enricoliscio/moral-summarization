Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should include as many as possible. The summary should be under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Planned Parenthood and the ACLU suing Alabama over a near-total abortion ban. The law is designed to be unconstitutional to challenge Roe v. Wade. There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and providers face severe penalties. The lawsuit argues the law is unconstitutional and harms marginalized groups, especially black and low-income people. They're fighting through legal channels.

Now, I need to incorporate the moral words: risk, exceptions, rape, incest, spend, engineered, wanted, used, overturn, pushing, unnecessary, politicallymotivated, ban, push, unconstitutional, stand, emboldened, exploit, gain, restrict, tailored, impossible, banning, harm, choice, fight, restrictions.

I'll start by stating the lawsuit, mentioning the ban's purpose. Then, highlight the lack of exceptions and penalties. Note that the law is designed to challenge Roe v. Wade. Include the ACLU's statement about it being unconstitutional. Mention the impact on marginalized groups. Conclude with the ongoing legal battle.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the key moral points without being too wordy. Let me piece it together, using the moral words where appropriate.

SUMMARY:  
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, which lacks exceptions for rape or incest and imposes severe penalties on providers. The law, designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, allows abortions only in cases of serious health risk, a narrowly tailored restriction deemed impossible to comply with. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood argue the ban is unconstitutional and disproportionately harms black and low-income communities. Alabama’s anti-abortion agenda, emboldened by Trump’s administration, aims to exploit health and lives for political gain. The lawsuit highlights the state’s history of politically motivated restrictions and the urgent need to fight for reproductive rights. The legal battle reflects a broader push to restrict abortion nationwide, with states introducing over 350 restrictions this year. The plaintiffs, including abortion clinics and a doctor, emphasize the moral imperative to protect patients’ lives and challenge the ban. END OF SUMMARY.
