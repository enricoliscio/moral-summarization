SUMMARY: Abortion rights advocates are taking Alabama to court over the state's near-total abortion ban, which carries a severe penalty of up to 99 years in prison for abortion providers and includes no exceptions for rape or incest. This is exactly what Alabama Republicans wanted and engineeredâ€”a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood argue that Alabama has a long history of restricting abortions and that the "serious health risk" exception is impossible to comply with. They also emphasize the disproportionate harm that banning abortion would bring to black and low-income communities, who make up a significant proportion of those seeking abortions in the state. With over 350 abortion restrictions introduced this year across the country and several states passing laws to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, abortion rights activists have no choice but to fight through the courts to protect their patients' lives and rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
