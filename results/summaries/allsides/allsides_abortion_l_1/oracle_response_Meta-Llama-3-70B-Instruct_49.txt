SUMMARY:

Alabama's near-total abortion ban, which poses a "serious health risk" to mothers, has sparked a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. The law, engineered by Republicans to overturn Roe v. Wade, has no exceptions for rape or incest and could lead to 99 years in prison for abortion providers. The ACLU argues that the law is "blatantly unconstitutional" and "politically motivated," aiming to "exploit" women's health and lives for political gain. The lawsuit claims that the ban will disproportionately "harm" black and low-income people, who make up a significant portion of those seeking abortions in the state. This is part of a larger trend, with over 350 abortion restrictions introduced in state legislatures this year. Planned Parenthood's president, Leana Wen, emphasizes that they have "no choice" but to fight through lawsuits, legislatures, and ballot boxes to protect their patients' lives. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are determined to "stand" against this unconstitutional ban and ensure that women have a "choice" in their reproductive healthcare. END OF SUMMARY.
