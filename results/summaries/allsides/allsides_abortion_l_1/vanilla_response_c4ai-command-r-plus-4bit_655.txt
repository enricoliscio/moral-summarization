SUMMARY: Planned Parenthood and the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Alabama over its near-total abortion ban, marking the first step in a long legal battle. The ban only allows abortions if the mother's health is at serious risk and imposes harsh penalties on providers. The lawsuit argues that the law is unconstitutionally severe and that the exception is impossible to comply with. It also highlights the disproportionate impact on black and low-income communities. This lawsuit is a response to Alabama Republicans' strategy to challenge Roe v. Wade. While abortion remains legal in all states, similar restrictive laws have been introduced across the country, sparking widespread protests.
END OF SUMMARY.
