SUMMARY:
The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The deal was led by the Russians and requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. The US is approaching the deal with "eyes wide open" and "caution," given the distrustful relationship between President Obama and Russian President Putin. Obama has made it clear that trusting the Russians and Assad will not be easy, and that the US needs to see "concrete actions" to demonstrate that Assad is "serious" about giving up his chemical weapons. While the deal is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action, and is a "win" for the administration, even if the optics are bad. END OF SUMMARY.
