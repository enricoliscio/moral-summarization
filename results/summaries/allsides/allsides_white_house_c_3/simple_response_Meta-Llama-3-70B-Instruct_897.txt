SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, averting a potential US military strike. The deal, brokered by Russia, requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. The agreement is seen as a win for Obama, as it meets his goal of preventing further chemical attacks, but it also requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their commitments. The administration is cautious, with Obama and Kerry emphasizing the need for verification and concrete actions from Assad. Critics, including Sen. Bob Corker, question Syria's willingness to follow through on the agreement. Despite the deal's imperfections, it offers a diplomatic solution to the crisis, with Obama avoiding an unpopular military strike and Russia emerging as a key player in the region.
