SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. This diplomatic push, led by the Russians, saved the day after President Obama's unsuccessful effort to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike. While the deal marks important progress, much work remains to be done. The Obama administration is proceeding with caution, expecting the Assad regime to live up to its public commitments and making clear that trusting the Russians and Assad will not be easy. The agreement requires Syria's chemical weapons to be removed or destroyed by 2014, with international inspections beginning by November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any potential violations will be taken to the UN Security Council for response. While the deal is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action, and if implemented, would meet Obama's goal of taking away the Assad regime's ability to conduct another chemical attack.

END OF SUMMARY.
