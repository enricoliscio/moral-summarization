SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The deal, announced on Saturday, was led by the Russians and comes after two weeks of diplomatic efforts. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. The Syrians must also provide full disclosure of their arsenal within a week. Any potential violations will be taken to the UN Security Council for response. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks, it requires the administration to trust the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. The agreement is seen as a win for Obama, but the optics are bad, with critics questioning whether Assad will follow through on his commitments.

END OF SUMMARY.
