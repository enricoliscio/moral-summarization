SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively removing the threat of US military action. The deal, led by Russia, comes after more than two weeks of diplomatic efforts and a failed attempt by President Obama to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections starting in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any potential violations will be taken to the UN Security Council. While the deal meets Obama's goal of taking away Assad's ability to conduct another chemical attack, it requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. Critics argue that the deal is far from perfect and that Syria's willingness to follow through is uncertain.
