SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, averting the threat of U.S. military action. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, announced the framework of the deal, which includes removing or destroying Syria's chemical weapons stockpile by 2014 and beginning international inspections by November. The deal was a diplomatic solution to the tense standoff between the U.S. and Syria, with Russia playing a key role. President Obama expressed caution, stating that the Assad regime must live up to its commitments, while also acknowledging the difficult relationship between the U.S. and Russia, particularly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The deal allows both sides to maintain their stance on potential use of force, with violations to be addressed by the U.N. Security Council. Experts believe the agreement is a substantive win for Obama, despite potential criticism from Congress and the public. It achieves Obama's goal of disarming Syria's chemical weapons capabilities, but leaves the Assad regime unscathed for now. The success of the deal relies on the trustworthiness of Syria and Russia, with the White House taking a cautious approach.
END OF SUMMARY.
