SUMMARY:
The US and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the American threat of military action off the table. The Obama administration is approaching the deal with "eyes wide open" and "caution," given the distrustful relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. While the deal is a "win" for Obama, it is far from perfect and requires a "leap of faith" in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. The administration is aware that Assad's willingness to follow through is an "open question." Despite the deal's imperfections, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action, which was met with criticism at home. END OF SUMMARY.
