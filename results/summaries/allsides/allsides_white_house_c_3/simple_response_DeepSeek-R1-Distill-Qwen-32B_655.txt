Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the US and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. The key points are that the threat of military action is off the table, the deal was pushed by Russia, and the US is cautious about trusting Syria and Russia. I should highlight the skepticism and the challenges in verifying the agreement. Also, mention that while it's a diplomatic win for Obama, it's not perfect and there's doubt about Syria's commitment. I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the original moral perspective.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, effectively ending the threat of U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, comes after weeks of tension and failed efforts by President Obama to gain support for a strike. While the administration is cautiously optimistic, there is skepticism about Syria and Russia's commitments. Obama emphasized the need for verification, stating, "We have committed to a standard that says verify and verify." The agreement requires Syria to destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with inspections starting in November and full disclosure within a week. However, any violations would be handled by the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. The deal avoids military action but leaves questions about Syria's willingness to comply. Critics, like Sen. Bob Corker, doubt Syria's commitment, and the administration faces scrutiny for trusting Russia and Assad. While the deal may prevent further chemical attacks, it does not resolve accountability for the August 21 attack. Obama's critics at home may not credit him, but the agreement offers a diplomatic exit from the crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
