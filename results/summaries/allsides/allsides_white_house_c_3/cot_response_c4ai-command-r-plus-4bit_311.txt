SUMMARY: 
A diplomatic push by the Russians has potentially saved Syria's chemical weapons stockpile from U.S. military action. While the Obama administration remains cautious about the agreement, it offers a way out of an unpopular call for military action. The deal, reached by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their commitments. It includes a tight timeline for the removal or destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and a mechanism for addressing potential violations. Although the deal meets Obama's goal of disabling Syria's chemical weapons capabilities, it does not hold the Assad regime accountable for the brutal August 21 attack that killed 1,400 civilians. The optics of the agreement are challenging for Obama, as it allows Assad to escape punishment for his heinous actions. However, experts argue that substantively, Obama is a winner, as it achieves his goal of securing Syria's chemical weapons without resorting to military force. The White House will take this outcome despite the criticism from Obama's critics at home.
