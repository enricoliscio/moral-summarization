Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. It mentions that this deal took the threat of U.S. military action off the table. The key points are: the agreement was a last-minute diplomatic push by Russia, the Obama administration is cautious, the deal requires Syria to destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, inspections by November, and full disclosure within a week. There's also a part about any violations going to the UN Security Council, where Russia can veto. 

I should note that the U.S. is skeptical of Syria and Russia's commitment. The deal is seen as a way out for Obama without military action, but it's not perfect. Experts like Jim Walsh think it's a win for Obama but the optics are bad because critics won't give him credit.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all the main points: the agreement, the conditions, the skepticism, and the implications for Obama. I'll structure it to first state the agreement, then the conditions, followed by the cautious approach from the U.S., and end with the political implications.

Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, defusing the threat of U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, requires Syria to destroy its chemical arsenal by 2014, with inspections starting by November and full disclosure of its stockpile within a week. The U.S. remains cautious, emphasizing verification and accountability, as trust in Syria and Russia is low. The agreement allows both sides to maintain their positions on potential future violations, with Russia retaining veto power over UN Security Council actions. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks, it leaves questions about Syria's commitment and accountability for the August 21 attack. The agreement is seen as a diplomatic win for Russia and a political challenge for Obama, who faces skepticism domestically despite avoiding military action. END OF SUMMARY.
