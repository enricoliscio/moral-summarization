SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively removing the threat of US military action. The deal, announced on Saturday, was led by the Russians and will be scrutinized by a distrustful Congress. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any potential violations will be taken to the UN Security Council. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing another chemical attack, it requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. Critics argue that the deal is far from perfect and that Syria's willingness to follow through is uncertain. Despite this, the agreement offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action.
