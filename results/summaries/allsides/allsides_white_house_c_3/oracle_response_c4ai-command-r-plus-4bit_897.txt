SUMMARY: After more than two weeks of saber-rattling and an unsuccessful effort to win support for military strikes against Syria, the Obama administration reached an agreement with Russia to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. While this deal takes military action off the table, it requires the US to trust the Russians and the Assad regime to follow through on their commitments. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for verification and concrete actions, with international inspections of Syria's arsenal set to begin by November and the stockpile to be removed or destroyed by 2014. The deal is a diplomatic win for Obama, preventing further chemical attacks and holding Assad responsible for the brutal Aug. 21 attack that killed 1,400 civilians. However, critics question Syria's willingness to comply, and the agreement relies on a leap of faith in trusting the Russians and Syrians to uphold their end of the deal. The fine details of the agreement include swift disclosure of Syria's arsenal, with any violations to be addressed by the UN Security Council. While the deal offers a way out of unpopular military action, it remains to be seen if it will truly hold Assad responsible for his regime's actions.
END OF SUMMARY.
