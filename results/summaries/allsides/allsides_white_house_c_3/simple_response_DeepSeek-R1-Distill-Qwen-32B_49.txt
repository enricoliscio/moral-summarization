Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Hmm, first, I should read the article carefully to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article starts by stating that the U.S. and Russia have agreed on securing Syria's chemical weapons, which stops the threat of U.S. military action. It mentions that after two weeks of tension and Obama's failed attempt to get Congress and public support, a last-minute Russian diplomatic push saved the day. But the Obama administration is cautious about the deal, especially since Congress doesn't trust Putin or Assad.

Obama and Kerry emphasize the need for verification, saying they won't just take Syria and Russia's word. There's a history of tension between Obama and Putin, including the Snowden issue and Putin's criticism of American exceptionalism. The deal's details include Syria's weapons being destroyed by 2014, inspections starting in November, and full disclosure within a week. Violations would go to the UN Security Council, where Russia can veto. This part shows both sides are maintaining their positions on potential force.

The article also notes that while the framework meets Obama's goal of preventing future attacks, it doesn't hold Assad accountable for the August 21 attack. Critics question Syria's willingness to follow through. The deal is seen as a win for Obama substantively but not politically, with Russia appearing as a diplomatic success. Obama might not get credit domestically, but it's a win on substance.

Now, to summarize this, I need to capture the key points: the agreement, the caution from the U.S., the verification emphasis, the deal details, the accountability issue, and the political implications. I should also maintain the moral framing, which seems to highlight the cautious optimism and the challenges in trusting Syria and Russia, as well as the political fallout for Obama.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it step by step: start with the agreement stopping military action, mention the diplomatic push, U.S. caution, verification, deal details, accountability issue, and the political and moral implications.

I need to ensure that the summary doesn't just list facts but also reflects the author's perspective on the trust issues and political dynamics. That way, the moral framing is preserved, showing that while the deal is a step forward, there's significant skepticism and challenges in implementation.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, effectively halting the threat of U.S. military action. While the deal, brokered by Russia, was welcomed by the Obama administration, there is significant caution about Syria and Russia's commitment to uphold their obligations. President Obama emphasized the need for verification, stating, "We have committed to a standard that says verify and verify." The deal requires Syria to destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. However, the agreement does not hold Syria accountable for the August 21 chemical attack, and critics question Syria's willingness to follow through. The deal, while seen as a diplomatic win for Russia, leaves Obama vulnerable domestically, as Congress and critics remain skeptical of Russia and Assad. The framework, though imperfect, offers a path to prevent future chemical attacks but raises moral questions about accountability and trust. END OF SUMMARY.
