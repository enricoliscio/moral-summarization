SUMMARY: After more than two weeks of push and sabre-rattling, a diplomatic push led by Russia has secured a deal to destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile by 2014. The agreement, announced by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, includes plans for international inspections and full disclosure of Syria's arsenal. While the deal takes the threat of U.S. military action off the table, it has been met with caution by the Obama administration, which has had a tense relationship with Russia and does not fully trust the Syrian regime. The fine details of the deal, which require Syria to offer full disclosure of its arsenal within a week and allow for inspections by November, represent progress in the effort to hold the Assad regime responsible for the brutal chemical attack that killed 1,400 civilians. However, the deal has been criticized by some as requiring a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their commitments. Despite the challenges, the agreement offers a way out of the unpopular call for military action and a potential win for Obama, who has struggled to gain support for a strike.
END OF SUMMARY.
