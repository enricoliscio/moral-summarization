SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, averting the threat of U.S. military action. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, announced the framework in Geneva, which includes a timeline for removing or destroying Syria's chemical weapons by 2014 and initiating international inspections by November. The deal is a diplomatic win for Obama, who had unsuccessfully sought congressional support for military strikes, but it requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their commitments. The fine details of the deal include a week for the Syrians to disclose their arsenal, with violations to be addressed by the UN Security Council. Obama acknowledged the challenges ahead, stating the need for "concrete actions" to demonstrate Assad's sincerity in giving up chemical weapons. The deal faces scrutiny in Congress due to distrust of Russian and Syrian leaders, and questions remain about holding Assad responsible for the August 21 attack that killed Syrian civilians. Despite the challenges, the agreement offers a way to prevent future chemical attacks and birthed a diplomatic solution to a complex issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
