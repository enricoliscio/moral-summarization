SUMMARY: The United States and Russia reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, averting the threat of U.S. military action. Despite tensions between President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the deal was negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, over three days in Geneva. The agreement includes a timeline for the removal or destruction of Syria's chemical weapons by 2014 and international inspections beginning in November. Obama expressed cautious optimism about the deal, stating that much work remains to be done and that the U.S. will not take Russia and Syria's word for it. The deal provides a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but the Obama administration faces skepticism from Congress and the public, with critics questioning Syria's willingness to follow through. Experts believe the deal offers a substantive win for Obama, despite the challenging optics of trusting Russia and Assad.
END OF SUMMARY.
