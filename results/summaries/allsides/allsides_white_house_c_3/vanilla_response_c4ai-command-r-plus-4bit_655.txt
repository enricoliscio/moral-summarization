SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, averting potential U.S. military action. While the deal was a diplomatic victory for the Obama administration, it was met with skepticism by Congress due to distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. The agreement includes a timeline for removing or destroying Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for verification and transparency in the process. The deal was a way for Obama to avoid an unpopular military strike, but it also presented a challenge in holding Assad accountable for the August 21 chemical attack that killed Syrian civilians. Critics questioned Syria's willingness to comply, highlighting the tenuous nature of the agreement. Despite the risks, the deal was seen as a substantive win for Obama, even if domestic critics were unlikely to give him credit.
END OF SUMMARY.
