Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've provided a specific structure for the response, which includes two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral judgment or imply a value judgment, such as "saber-rattling," "untrustworthy," or "brutal." These words convey more than just factual information; they imply approval or disapproval.

Looking at the provided news article, I'll go through it to identify these words. The article talks about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. There's mention of military action being taken off the table, which implies a shift from a potential conflict. The Obama administration is cautious, using terms like "verify" multiple times, indicating a lack of trust. The article also mentions the distrust in Putin and Assad, which are morally framed as they imply negative traits.

Next, I'll list all the single words that carry moral framing. I'll make sure each is on a new line with a star. Words like "saber-rattling," "untrustworthy," "brutal," "verify," "distrustful," "dubious," "unpopular," "winners," "optics," "leap of faith," and "substantive" come to mind. These words are used to convey the moral stance of the parties involved.

After identifying these words, the next step is to write a concise summary of the article, incorporating as many of these words as possible without making the summary too long. The summary should be under 200 words and preserve the moral framing. I'll need to ensure that the key points are covered: the agreement reached, the cautious approach by the Obama administration, the distrust in Russia and Syria, the verification process, and the political implications both domestically and internationally.

I also need to make sure the summary flows well and accurately reflects the article's content while highlighting the moral aspects. It's important to maintain the balance between summarizing the facts and conveying the moral judgments present in the original text.

Finally, I'll structure the response as per the user's instructions, starting with "STEP 1:" followed by the list of morally framed words, and then the "SUMMARY:" section with the concise summary. I'll end with "END OF SUMMARY." to comply with the formatting requirements.

Throughout this process, I need to be careful not to introduce any new information or deviate from the original article's content. The focus should be on accurately summarizing while preserving the moral framing, ensuring clarity and conciseness.

**STEP 1:**  
* Saber-rattling  
* Untrustworthy  
* Brutal  
* Verify  
* Distrustful  
* Dubious  
* Unpopular  
* Winners  
* Optics  
* Leap of faith  
* Substantive  

**SUMMARY:**  
The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, avoiding U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, requires Syria to destroy its arsenal by 2014, with international inspections starting in November. The Obama administration remains cautious, emphasizing verification and skepticism toward Syria and Russia. Critics question Syria's willingness to comply, and the deal leaves unanswered whether Assad is held accountable for the August chemical attack. While the agreement avoids military conflict, it faces scrutiny from Congress and criticism over trusting Assad and Putin. Obama gains substantively but faces domestic backlash. The deal is seen as a diplomatic win for Russia and a way out for Obama, though its optics are poor.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
