SUMMARY: A deal between the U.S. and Russia to secure Syria's chemical weapons has averted the threat of U.S. military action. While this deal offers a diplomatic solution and meets President Obama's goal of disarming Syria's chemical arsenal, it requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their commitments. Obama has expressed caution and skepticism about the deal, emphasizing the need for concrete actions and verification. The deal's fine details include a timeline for disarmament and inspections, with violations to be addressed by the UN Security Council. Critics argue that Syria's compliance is uncertain, and the deal may weaken Obama's stance on holding Assad accountable for the chemical attack that killed Syrian civilians. Despite the challenges, the deal provides a way out of military action for Obama, who faced opposition from Congress and the public. Experts believe the deal is a substantive win for Obama, despite potential criticism from domestic opponents.
