Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but first, I have to identify all the single words that are morally framed. Hmm, let me read through the article again to pick up on those. 

The article talks about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. Words like "threat," "saber-rattling," "unsuccessful," "distrustful," "commitments," "verify," "caution," "trust," "tense," "sparring," "asylum," "leaked," "treasure trove," "classified," "intelligence," "surveillance," "dubious," "concrete actions," "serious," "hand over," "unpopular," "win," "optics," "bombed," "happy," "birth," "diplomatic solution," "credit," "critics," "substance," "win," "unpopular," "substance," "win." 

Wait, I think I might be missing some. Let me go through each paragraph. 

First paragraph: "threat," "saber-rattling," "unsuccessful," "Congressional," "public," "limited," "diplomatic," "saved," "wading," "scrutinized," "distrustful," "commitments," "progress," "remains." 

Second paragraph: "caution," "verify," "verify," "trust," "tense," "sparring," "asylum," "leaked," "treasure trove," "classified," "intelligence," "surveillance," "dubious," "concrete actions," "serious," "hand over." 

Third paragraph: "unpopular," "win," "optics," "bombed," "happy," "birth," "diplomatic solution," "credit," "critics," "substance," "win." 

I think that's all. Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. The summary should reflect the moral framing the author used, which seems to highlight the challenges of trusting Russia and Syria, the cautious approach by the U.S., and the political implications of the deal.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the agreement, the shift from military action to diplomacy, the skepticism from Congress and the U.S. administration, the verification process, the political optics, and the expert opinions on the deal's substance versus its appearance.

Now, I'll make sure to include the key morally framed words like "threat," "saber-rattling," "unsuccessful," "distrustful," "commitments," "verify," "caution," "trust," "tense," "asylum," "leaked," "treasure trove," "classified," "intelligence," "surveillance," "dubious," "concrete actions," "serious," "hand over," "unpopular," "win," "optics," "bombed," "happy," "birth," "diplomatic solution," "credit," "critics," "substance," "win." 

I need to weave these into a coherent summary without making it too wordy. I'll focus on the administration's cautious approach, the verification process, the political implications, and the expert opinions. 

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each morally framed word is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words. 

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it flows naturally while incorporating the necessary moral framing words.

**SUMMARY:**

The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, shifting from the threat of military action to diplomacy. This deal, following weeks of "saber-rattling" and failed efforts to gain Congressional support, was brokered by Russia, easing the immediate threat of U.S. strikes. However, the Obama administration remains cautious, emphasizing the need to "verify" Syria's commitments. Trust in Russia and Syria isenuous, given past tensions and skepticism. The deal requires Syria to declare its arsenal within a week, with inspections starting in November, and destruction by 2014. Any violations would go to the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. While the framework meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks, it leaves questions about Syria's accountability for the August attack. Critics remain skeptical, questioning Syria's willingness to comply. Despite the deal's imperfections, it offers a diplomatic solution, though politically it may not garner credit for Obama. Experts note it's a substantive win but faces "bad optics" domestically. END OF SUMMARY.
