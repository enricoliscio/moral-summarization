SUMMARY: The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. After weeks of saber-rattling, the Obama administration is approaching the deal with caution, recognizing that much work remains to be done. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any potential violations will be taken to the UN Security Council for response. While the deal is far from perfect, it meets Obama's goal of taking away Assad's ability to conduct another chemical attack. However, the administration will have a harder time making its case that it truly held Assad responsible for the brutal attack that killed 1,400 Syrian civilians. The deal requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal, but for Obama, it offers the best way out of his unpopular call for military action. END OF SUMMARY.
