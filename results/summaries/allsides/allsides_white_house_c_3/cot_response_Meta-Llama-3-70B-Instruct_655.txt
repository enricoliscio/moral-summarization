SUMMARY:
The US and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The Obama administration is approaching the deal with caution, with eyes wide open, due to a distrustful Congress and the dubious claims of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for verification, saying "we have committed to a standard that says verify and verify." The deal requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. While the agreement is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action. Despite the bad optics, the deal is a win for Obama, as it meets his goal of taking away the Assad regime's ability to conduct another brutal chemical attack. END OF SUMMARY.
