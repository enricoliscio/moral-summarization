Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons, which avoided military action. The author uses words like "push," "progress," "secure," "destroy," etc., which I need to include.

I should focus on the key elements: the agreement's terms, the skepticism from Congress, the verification process, and the political implications. Also, note the moral implications like trust, responsibility, and the consequences of the attack.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the agreement, the cautious approach from the U.S., the verification steps, and the political dynamics between the U.S., Russia, and Syria. I'll make sure to use as many of the morally framed words as possible without making it too long.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words and that all key points are covered coherently.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, avoiding potential U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, requires Syria to disclose its arsenal within a week, begin inspections by November, and remove or destroy its stockpile by 2014. The U.S. remains cautious, emphasizing verification and accountability, as trust in Russia and Syria is low. Obama and Kerry stressed the need for concrete actions to ensure compliance, while acknowledging the deal's imperfections. The agreement allows both sides to claim they maintained their positions on potential violations, which would be addressed by the UN Security Council. Critics, like Sen. Corker, question Syria's willingness to follow through. The deal offers Obama a way out of military action but leaves unanswered questions about holding Assad responsible for the August 21 attack that killed 1,400 civilians. The outcome is seen as a diplomatic win for Russia and a pragmatic solution for Obama, though it faces skepticism at home. END OF SUMMARY.
