Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons. This stops the threat of U.S. military action. The deal was made after a lot of tension and failed attempts by Obama to get support for a strike. The Russians led the last-minute push, which was a diplomatic success. 

Obama and Kerry are cautious, saying they need to verify the Syrian government's commitments. They mention that inspections will start soon, and Syria has to disclose its arsenal. There's a part about what happens if Syria violates the agreement, involving the UN Security Council, where Russia can veto. 

The article also notes that while this deal prevents another chemical attack, it doesn't hold Assad accountable for the August attack that killed many civilians. Critics like Sen. Corker are skeptical about Syria's willingness to follow through. 

The author uses words like "push," "progress," "secure," "destroy," "leaked," etc., which have moral connotations. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. 

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the agreement, the diplomatic push by Russia, the cautious approach by the U.S., the verification process, the potential for inspections and disclosure, the UN involvement, and the implications for accountability. 

I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows well while preserving the moral framing. Let me start drafting, making sure to include those specific words.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, effectively halting the threat of U.S. military action. This diplomatic push came after weeks of tension and failed efforts by President Obama to gain support for a strike. While the deal is seen as progress, Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry remain cautious, emphasizing the need to verify Syria's commitments. Inspections will begin by November, and Syria must disclose its arsenal within a week. Any violations would be addressed by the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. The deal aims to prevent future chemical attacks but does not hold Assad accountable for the August 21 attack that killed 1,400 civilians. Critics, like Sen. Bob Corker, question Syria's willingness to follow through. The agreement, though imperfect, offers a diplomatic solution, with Russia appearing to birth a peaceful outcome. However, Obama faces criticism at home, and the optics of the deal are seen as unfavorable. END OF SUMMARY.
