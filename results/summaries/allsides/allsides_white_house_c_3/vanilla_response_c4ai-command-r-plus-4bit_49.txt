SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. This deal effectively removes the threat of U.S. military action against Syria, despite initial resistance from the Obama administration. While the deal offers a diplomatic solution to the Syrian chemical weapons crisis, it also presents a challenge for the Obama administration to trust the Russians and the Assad regime to uphold their end of the bargain. The deal was negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and requires Syria to provide full disclosure of its chemical arsenal within a week. Any violations of the agreement will be referred to the UN Security Council. The deal allows both the U.S. and Russia to maintain their stance on potential use of force, with Putin opposing military action and Obama refusing to cede his authority. The Obama administration remains cautious, emphasizing the need for concrete actions and verification from Syria. Critics of the deal question Syria's willingness to follow through, and the White House faces a challenge in making its case that the Assad regime was responsible for the August 21 chemical attack that killed 1,400 civilians. Despite the challenges, the deal provides a way out of an unpopular call for military action, and experts believe it is a substantive win for Obama, despite potential negative optics.
END OF SUMMARY.
