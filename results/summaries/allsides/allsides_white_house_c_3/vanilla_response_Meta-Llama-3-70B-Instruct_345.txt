SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The deal, announced on Saturday, was led by the Russians and comes after more than two weeks of diplomatic efforts. Under the agreement, Syria's chemical weapons must be removed or destroyed by 2014, international inspections will begin by November, and the Syrians will offer full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. The deal will be scrutinized by Congress, which is distrustful of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have expressed caution, stating that the US will not take Russia and Assad's word for it and will require concrete actions to demonstrate Assad's commitment to giving up his chemical weapons. The deal is far from perfect, but it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action.

END OF SUMMARY.
