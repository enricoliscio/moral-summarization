Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. and Russia's agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that the U.S. and Russia reached an agreement, which took the threat of U.S. military action off the table. President Obama had been trying to get congressional and public support for a strike, but it didn't work. Instead, a last-minute diplomatic push by Russia led to the deal.

Obama and Secretary of State Kerry are cautious, emphasizing verification. They don't trust Assad or Putin easily. There's mention of their tense relationship and Putin's comments in the NYT, which didn't help build trust.

The deal's details include removing or destroying Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, inspections by November, and Syria must declare its arsenal within a week. Violations would go to the UN Security Council, where Russia can veto. This allows both sides to maintain their positions on potential force.

The deal meets Obama's goal of preventing more chemical attacks but doesn't resolve responsibility for the August attack. Critics like Sen. Corker are skeptical. Experts say it's a win for Obama substantively but looks bad politically.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the agreement, the caution from Obama and Kerry, the deal's specifics, the verification process, and the political implications.

Let me structure it: Start with the agreement and its effect on military action. Mention Obama's and Kerry's cautious stance. Detail the agreement terms briefly. Note the verification and UN process. Conclude with the political implications and expert opinions.

Make sure it's concise and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, preventing U.S. military action. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry expressed caution, emphasizing the need for verification. The deal requires Syria to destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with inspections starting in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any violations would be addressed by the UN Security Council, where Russia has veto power. While the agreement meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks, it does not resolve responsibility for the August 21 attack. Critics remain skeptical of Syria's commitment, and the deal is seen as a political win for Russia and a way out for Obama, despite domestic criticism. END OF SUMMARY.
