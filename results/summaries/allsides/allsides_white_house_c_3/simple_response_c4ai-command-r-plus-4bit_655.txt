SUMMARY: President Obama's tense relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin has been tested as the two nations reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. While Obama threatened military action, it was a diplomatic push led by the Russians that ultimately resolved the issue. The deal, negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, outlines a plan to remove or destroy Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. Obama, however, remains cautious and has made it clear that trusting the Russians and Syrian President Bashar Assad will not be easy. The deal offers a way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action, but it also makes it more difficult to hold Assad accountable for the brutal chemical attack that killed Syrian civilians. The agreement has been met with skepticism, with critics questioning Syria's willingness to follow through and highlighting the challenge of trusting the Russians and Syrians to uphold their commitments. The fine details of the deal, including the potential use of force for violations, will be closely scrutinized by Congress and the international community. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks, it also presents a complex moral dilemma between upholding justice and pursuing diplomacy.
END OF SUMMARY.
