SUMMARY:
The US and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the American threat of military action off the table. The Obama administration is approaching the deal with "eyes wide open," given the distrustful relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for verification, saying "we have committed to a standard that says verify and verify." The deal requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. While the agreement is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action. As one expert noted, "Obama is a winner on this substantively, but the optics on this are bad." The administration will need to take a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal.
END OF SUMMARY.
