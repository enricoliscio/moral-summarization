Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points. 

The article talks about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons. The U.S. had threatened military action, but this diplomatic move by Russia averted that. The Obama administration is cautious about trusting Russia and Assad, emphasizing verification. They mentioned the need for inspections, disclosure, and concrete actions. There's skepticism from Congress and experts about Syria's willingness to follow through. The deal sets deadlines for removing or destroying the weapons by 2014, with inspections starting in November. Violations would go to the UN, where Russia can veto. The agreement aims to prevent future attacks but doesn't hold Assad fully responsible for the August attack. Some see it as a win for Obama, but it's not perfect and requires trust.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: push, progress, secure, destroy, leaked, claim, attacks, see, removed, destroyed, inspections, disclosure, violations, refused, taking, attack, responsible, killed, birthing, war, win.

I should structure the summary to cover the agreement, the cautious approach by the U.S., the verification process, the deadlines, the role of the UN, the implications for Assad's responsibility, and the mixed reactions. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning the agreement, then the U.S. and Russia's roles. Highlight the verification and inspections, the deadlines, and the UN's role. Then discuss the cautious stance, the need for concrete actions, and the mixed reactions. Finally, note that it's a win but requires trust.

Let me check if I'm using the moral words correctly. Words like 'push' (diplomatic push), 'progress' (made progress),'secure' and 'destroy' (chemical weapons), 'attacks' (chemical), 'inspections', 'disclosure', 'violations','refused' (Obama refusing to cede authority), 'attack' (August attack),'responsible' (holding Assad responsible), 'killed' (civilians), 'birthing' (diplomatic solution), 'war' (another war), 'win' (Obama's win).

I think that covers most of them. Now, putting it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, averting potential U.S. military action. The deal, pushed by Russia, requires Syria to remove or destroy its arsenal by 2014, with inspections starting in November and full disclosure of its stockpile within a week. The U.S. remains cautious, emphasizing verification and inspections to ensure Syria's commitments. Secretary of State John Kerry stressed the need to "verify and verify," while President Obama warned that trust in Russia and Assad would not be easy. The deal allows both sides to claim they maintained their stance on potential force for violations, which would be addressed by the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. Critics, including Sen. Bob Corker, question Syria's willingness to follow through. The agreement aims to prevent future chemical attacks but does not hold Assad fully responsible for the August 21 attack that killed 1,400 civilians. While experts see it as a win for Obama, it requires a leap of faith in trusting Syria and Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
