SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The deal, announced on Saturday, was led by the Russians and will be scrutinized by a distrustful Congress. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any potential violations will be taken to the UN Security Council for response. While the deal meets Obama's goal of taking away Assad's ability to conduct another chemical attack, it requires the administration to trust the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. Critics argue that the deal is far from perfect and requires a leap of faith, but it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action.

END OF SUMMARY.
