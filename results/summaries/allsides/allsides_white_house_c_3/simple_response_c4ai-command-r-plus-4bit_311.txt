SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, averting the need for military action. While this deal meets President Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks by the Assad regime, it also requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their end of the bargain. Obama has expressed skepticism about the trustworthiness of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad, and the deal will be closely scrutinized by a distrustful Congress. The fine details of the agreement include a timeline for the removal or destruction of Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of the arsenal within a week. Any violations would be referred to the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. Critics argue that the deal favors Syria and Russia, and that Assad's willingness to follow through is questionable. However, the deal provides a diplomatic solution and a way out of the unpopular call for military action.

END OF SUMMARY.
