Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about the US and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. It mentions that this deal effectively stops the threat of US military action. 

Hmm, the key points here are the agreement itself, the involvement of the Obama administration, the skepticism from Congress, and the details of the deal. I should note that the deal was a last-minute push by Russia, and Obama is cautious about trusting Assad and Putin. 

Also, there are specific details like the timeline for removing chemical weapons, inspections starting in November, and the mechanism for dealing with violations through the UN. Plus, the political implications for Obama, like how this might not gain him much credit domestically but is seen as a win internationally.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main elements: the agreement, the caution from Obama and Kerry, the details of the deal, and the political ramifications. I should make sure to include that the deal is not perfect but offers a way out for Obama without military action. 

Let me structure it step by step: start with the agreement, mention the caution, outline the deal's specifics, and then touch on the political and international reactions. That should cover all the necessary points succinctly.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, defusing the threat of U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. The Obama administration remains cautious, emphasizing verification and accountability, as trust in Syria's President Assad and Russian President Putin is low. Obama stressed that concrete actions are needed to prove Assad's commitment. The agreement also allows for UN Security Council involvement in addressing violations, though Russia retains veto power. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing future chemical attacks, it leaves questions about accountability for the August 21 attack. Critics, including Sen. Bob Corker, doubt Syria's willingness to follow through. The deal is imperfect but offers Obama a way to avoid military action, though it may not gain him domestic credit. END OF SUMMARY.
