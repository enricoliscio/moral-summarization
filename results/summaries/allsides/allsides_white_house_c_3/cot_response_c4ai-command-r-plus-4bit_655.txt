SUMMARY:
The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, effectively removing the threat of U.S. military action. The deal, negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, requires Syria to disclose and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. While the Obama administration expressed caution and emphasized the need for verification, the deal offered a way out of an unpopular call for military action. It remains to be seen if Syria will follow through on its commitments, with critics questioning the trustworthiness of the Syrians and Russians. The deal was a diplomatic win for Russia, but President Obama's critics at home may not give him credit for it. The agreement allows both sides to stand their ground on the potential use of force for violations by the Assad regime. While the deal meets Obama's goal of disarming Assad's chemical weapons capability, it does not hold Assad accountable for the brutal August 21 attack that killed 1,400 Syrian civilians. The fine details of the deal, including verification and enforcement mechanisms, will be crucial in ensuring its success and holding Syria accountable.
