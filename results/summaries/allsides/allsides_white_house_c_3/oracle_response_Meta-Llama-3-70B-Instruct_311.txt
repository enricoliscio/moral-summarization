SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. This last-minute diplomatic push, led by the Russians, saved the day after President Obama's unsuccessful effort to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike. The deal requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning by November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. The agreement also allows for potential violations to be taken to the UN Security Council for response. While the deal is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action. The administration is proceeding with caution, recognizing that trusting the Russians and Assad will not be easy. As Obama stated, "We are not just going to take Russia and Assad's word for it. We need to see concrete actions to demonstrate that Assad is serious about giving up his chemical weapons." END OF SUMMARY.
