SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively removing the threat of US military action. The deal, led by Russia, requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. The agreement is met with caution, as the Obama administration is wary of trusting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. The deal's success relies on Assad's commitment to giving up his chemical weapons, with the US demanding concrete actions to demonstrate his seriousness. While the agreement is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action. Experts see the deal as a win for Obama, but the optics are bad, with Syria avoiding bombing and Russia appearing to birth a diplomatic solution. The White House will take the deal as a positive outcome after a tense two weeks.

END OF SUMMARY.
