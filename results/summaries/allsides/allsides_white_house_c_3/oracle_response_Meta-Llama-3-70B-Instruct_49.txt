SUMMARY: The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. After weeks of saber-rattling, the Obama administration is approaching the deal with caution, recognizing that much work remains to be done. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any violations will be taken to the UN Security Council for response. While the deal is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of an unpopular call for military action. The administration is taking a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal, but if implemented, it would meet Obama's goal of taking away the Assad regime's ability to conduct another chemical attack. END OF SUMMARY.
