SUMMARY: On Saturday, the U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, averting the threat of U.S. military action. Despite tensions between President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and skepticism about Syrian President Bashar Assad's commitment, the deal offers a diplomatic solution to the crisis. The agreement includes a timeline for removing or destroying Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of the arsenal within a week. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks by the Assad regime, it remains to be seen if Syria will follow through on its commitments. Critics argue that the deal favors Russia and Assad, but supporters contend that it is a substantive win for Obama, despite the optics. The White House is cautious but optimistic about the potential for progress in Syria.
