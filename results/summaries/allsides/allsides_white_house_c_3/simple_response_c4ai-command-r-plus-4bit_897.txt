SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia reached a deal to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, averting the threat of U.S. military action. Despite tensions between President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and skepticism about Syrian compliance, the deal offers a face-saving solution for Obama after his failed attempt to garner support for military strikes. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for verification, and Obama acknowledged the challenges ahead. The deal requires Syria to disclose its arsenal within a week and allows for taking violations to the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. Critics question Syria's willingness to comply, but the deal achieves Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks and provides a diplomatic solution to a complex crisis. Jim Walsh, an international security expert, notes that while Obama may not receive credit due to domestic criticism, he is substantively a winner in this deal.
