Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about the US and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. The key points are that this deal stops the threat of US military action. The author uses words like "push," "progress," "secure," "destroy," etc., which have moral connotations. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should note that the agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with inspections starting in November. The US is cautious, emphasizing verification. There's distrust towards Russia and Assad, as mentioned by Obama and Kerry. The deal's implementation is a win for Obama but faces criticism at home.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. Let me structure it to include the main points: the agreement, the terms, the cautious approach, and the implications. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words provided.

Also, I should end the summary with the required tokens. Let me put it all together concisely, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively halting the threat of U.S. military action. This deal, brokered by Russia after weeks of tension, requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. The Obama administration is proceeding cautiously, emphasizing verification and accountability, as trust in Syria and Russia is limited. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have made it clear that the Assad regime must demonstrate concrete actions to fulfill its commitments. The deal also allows for potential violations to be addressed by the United Nations Security Council, where Russia retains veto power. While the framework aligns with Obama's goal of preventing future chemical attacks, it leaves unanswered questions about holding Assad accountable for the August 21 attack that killed 1,400 civilians. Critics, including Sen. Bob Corker, remain skeptical of Syria's willingness to comply. The agreement, though imperfect, offers a diplomatic alternative to military action, with Russia framing it as a success and Obama facing domestic criticism despite the substantive progress. END OF SUMMARY.
