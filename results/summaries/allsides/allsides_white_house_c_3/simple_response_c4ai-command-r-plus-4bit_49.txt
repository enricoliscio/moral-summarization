SUMMARY: With the threat of U.S. military action against Syria looming, a diplomatic solution was reached between the U.S. and Russia to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. While this deal takes military action off the table, it also requires a leap of faith from the Obama administration, trusting that the Syrians and Russians will uphold their end of the bargain. The deal includes a timeline for the removal or destruction of chemical weapons, international inspections, and full disclosure of Syria's arsenal. Any violations would be brought to the U.N. Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. This element has been criticized by some, as it gives Russia the ability to block any potential response to violations by the Assad regime. Overall, the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing another chemical attack by the Assad regime, but it remains to be seen if Syria will follow through on its commitments. The deal has been met with skepticism by some, including Sen. Bob Corker, who questioned Syria's willingness to abide by the agreement. Despite the criticism, the diplomatic solution offers a way out of the unpopular call for military action by Obama.

END OF SUMMARY.
