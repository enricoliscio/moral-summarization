SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The deal, led by the Russians, comes after two weeks of diplomatic efforts and a failed attempt by President Obama to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike. While the agreement is a step forward, the Obama administration is cautious, with eyes wide open, given the distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. The deal requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections starting in November. The US is wary of trusting the Russians and Assad, and the agreement's success depends on their commitment to the deal. Despite its imperfections, the deal offers the best way out of the crisis, but its optics are bad, with Assad and the Russians emerging as winners.

END OF SUMMARY.
