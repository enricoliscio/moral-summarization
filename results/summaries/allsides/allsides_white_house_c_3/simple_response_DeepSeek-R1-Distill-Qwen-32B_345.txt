Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the US and Russia reaching an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons. The main points are that the threat of military action by the US was averted because of this deal. The Obama administration was cautious, emphasizing verification, and there's a lot of skepticism about Syria and Russia's commitments. The agreement includes timelines for destruction, inspections, and consequences for violations. It also mentions the political implications, like how this might affect Obama's reputation and the challenges in proving Syria's responsibility for the chemical attack.

I need to make sure the summary captures the cautious optimism, the verification processes, and the political dynamics. Also, the moral framing is importantâ€”so highlighting the US's skepticism and the need for concrete actions from Syria and Russia.

Let me structure the summary: start with the agreement, mention the end of the threat of military action, then the cautious approach by the US, the details of the agreement, and the political implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures the moral aspects.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, include the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens as instructed.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, ending the threat of U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. The U.S. remains cautious, emphasizing verification and accountability, as trust in Syria and Russia is low. The agreement allows both sides to maintain their positions on potential future violations. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks, it does not resolve questions about Syria's responsibility for the August 21 attack. Critics remain skeptical, and the administration faces scrutiny from Congress. The deal offers a diplomatic exit for Obama but leaves lingering doubts about Syria's commitment and the effectiveness of the agreement. END OF SUMMARY.
