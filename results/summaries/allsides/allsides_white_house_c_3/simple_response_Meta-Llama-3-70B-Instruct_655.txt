SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The deal, led by Russia, comes after two weeks of diplomatic efforts and a failed attempt by President Obama to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing another chemical attack, it requires the administration to trust the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. Critics argue that the agreement is imperfect and allows Assad to avoid accountability for the brutal August 21 attack. Despite this, the deal offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action, and experts consider it a substantive win for the administration.
