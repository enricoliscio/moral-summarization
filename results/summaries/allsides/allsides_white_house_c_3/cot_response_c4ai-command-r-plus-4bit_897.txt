SUMMARY:
After more than two weeks of saber-rattling and an unsuccessful effort to win support for military action in Syria, the Obama administration reached an agreement with Russia to secure Syria's chemical weapons. While this deal effectively removes the threat of U.S. military action, it requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their commitments. President Obama has expressed caution and skepticism, given his tense relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad's brutal track record. The deal, which calls for the removal or destruction of Syria's chemical weapons by 2014 and international inspections, offers a diplomatic solution to the crisis. However, it presents a moral dilemma for Obama, as he must balance the need to hold Assad accountable for the brutal chemical attack that killed 1,400 civilians with the unpopularity of military action. Critics of the deal question Syria's willingness to follow through, and it remains to be seen if Obama will be given credit for averting a military strike while still achieving his goal of disarming Assad's chemical weapons capability.
