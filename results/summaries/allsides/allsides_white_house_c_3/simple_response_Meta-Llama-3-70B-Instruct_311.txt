SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively removing the threat of US military action. The deal, led by Russia, requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. The agreement is a win for Obama, as it meets his goal of preventing further chemical attacks, but it requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. The White House is cautious, with Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry emphasizing the need for verification and concrete actions from Assad. The deal is far from perfect, but it offers a way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action. While the optics may be bad, with Assad and Russia appearing to benefit, the agreement is a substantive win for Obama.

END OF SUMMARY.
