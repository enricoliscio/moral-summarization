SUMMARY:
The United States and Russia reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, averting the U.S. threat of military action. The deal, negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, requires Syria to disclose and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November. While the deal meets President Obama's goal of preventing another chemical attack by the Assad regime, it relies on a leap of faith, trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their commitments. The administration remains cautious, aware of the brutal nature of the Assad regime and the doubtful track record of the Russians, who have previously sparred with the U.S. over Syria policy and granted asylum to Edward Snowden. The deal also faces scrutiny from Congress, which is mistrustful of Russian and Syrian intentions, and questions remain about Syria's willingness to comply. Critics of the deal argue that it lets the Assad regime off the hook for the brutal chemical attack that killed Syrian civilians. While the agreement offers a diplomatic solution, it requires a leap of faith and leaves the Obama administration vulnerable to criticism for its handling of the Syria crisis.
