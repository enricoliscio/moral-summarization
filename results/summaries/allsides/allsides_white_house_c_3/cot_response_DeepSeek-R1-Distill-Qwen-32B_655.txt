Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions, so I should follow them step by step.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. I'll go through the text and look for words that carry moral connotations. Words like "saber-rattling," "distrustful," "caution," "verify," "commitments," "serious," "concrete actions," "exceptionalism," "asylum," "leaked," "treasure trove," "brutal," "unpopular," "win," "winners," "critics," "substance," "win," "unpopular," "win," "winners," "critics," "substance," "win." I'll list these out as per the user's instruction.

Next, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be under 200 words and should capture the essence of the agreement between the U.S. and Russia, the cautious approach by Obama and Kerry, the skepticism from Congress, and the broader implications of the deal. I should ensure that the moral framing is preserved, highlighting the trust issues, verification processes, and the political dynamics involved.

I'll structure the summary to start with the agreement, mention the shift from military action to diplomacy, the cautious stance from the U.S., the details of the deal, the challenges in trusting Syria and Russia, and the political implications for Obama. I'll also include the expert opinion on the optics of the deal and the White House's perspective.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without exceeding the word limit. I'll also ensure that the morally framed words are naturally integrated into the summary to maintain the author's original tone and framing.

### SUMMARY:  
The U.S. and Russia reached a diplomatic agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, avoiding potential U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, faces skepticism from Congress, which distrusts both Syrian President Assad and Russian President Putin. Obama emphasized the need to "verify and verify" Syria's commitments, while Kerry stressed the importance of concrete actions to ensure Assad's sincerity. The agreement requires Syria to destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. However, any violations would be addressed by the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. Critics question Syria's willingness to follow through, and the deal is seen as a political win for Russia and Assad, while Obama faces domestic criticism for appearing to trust them. Despite the challenges, the White House views the deal as the best way to avoid military action and hold Assad accountable for the August 21 chemical attack. The optics of the deal are unfavorable for Obama, but experts argue it is a substantive win. END OF SUMMARY.
