Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. So, the main point is that they've agreed to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, which stops the threat of U.S. military action. 

The article mentions that after Obama tried to get Congress and the public on board for a strike, Russia stepped in with a diplomatic push. Obama and Kerry are cautious, emphasizing verification. There's tension between Obama and Putin, especially over Snowden and Putin's NYT article. 

The deal's details include removing or destroying weapons by 2014, inspections starting in November, and Syria must declare its arsenal within a week. Violations would go to the UN Security Council, where Russia can veto. This means both sides maintain their positions on possible force. 

The agreement meets Obama's goal of preventing more attacks but doesn't hold Assad accountable for the August 21 attack. Critics are skeptical, and while it's a diplomatic win for Obama, it's politically risky at home. Experts see it as a win but note the optics are bad because Syria isn't bombed, and Russia looks good.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the agreement, the verification, the details, the political implications, and the cautious reception. I should make sure to include key points like the timeline, inspections, accountability, and the reactions from Obama and critics.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, defusing the threat of U.S. military action. The deal, brokered by Russia, requires Syria to declare its arsenal within a week, begin inspections by November, and eliminate its stockpile by 2014. Both sides agreed to bring any violations to the UN Security Council, where Russia retains veto power. While the framework meets Obama's goal of preventing further chemical attacks, it does not hold Syria accountable for the August 21 attack. Obama and Kerry emphasized the need for verification, acknowledging the deal's risks and the skepticism of Congress. Critics, including Sen. Bob Corker, question Syria's commitment. Experts view the deal as a diplomatic win for Obama but note political challenges at home. END OF SUMMARY.
