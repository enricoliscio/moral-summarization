Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. It mentions that this deal took the threat of U.S. military action off the table after some tension. The Obama administration is cautious about trusting Russia and Assad, as they have a history of distrust. The deal includes specifics like destroying the weapons by 2014 and inspections starting in November. There's also a mention that any violations would go to the UN, where Russia can veto. 

I should highlight the skepticism from the U.S. side, their emphasis on verification, and the political implications. The summary needs to be under 200 words and include the moral elements like trust issues and the optics of the deal. I'll make sure to mention that the deal is seen as a win for Obama but faces criticism at home. Also, note that the deal requires trust and verification, and that the U.S. hasn't fully held Assad accountable for the chemical attack.

Let me structure this: start with the agreement, mention the U.S. caution, outline the deal's terms, discuss the verification and UN aspect, note the political optics, and conclude with the cautious optimism.

Make sure to include key points: the deal's terms, the verification process, the UN's role, the political implications for Obama, and the cautious stance from the U.S. side. Keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, defusing the threat of U.S. military action. The Obama administration remains cautious, emphasizing the need for verification and accountability from Syria and Russia. The deal requires Syria to declare its arsenal within a week, destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, and allow international inspections by November. Any violations would be addressed by the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. While the agreement meets Obama's goal of preventing future chemical attacks, it leaves unresolved the question of Assad's responsibility for the August 21 attack. Critics, including Sen. Bob Corker, doubt Syria's commitment to the deal. Obama's administration faces skepticism at home, but the agreement offers a diplomatic exit from the crisis. Experts note that while the deal is a substantive win for Obama, its political optics are problematic, with Assad and Russia appearing to benefit more. The administration must trust Syria and Russia to uphold their commitments, a risky move given their history of distrust. END OF SUMMARY.
