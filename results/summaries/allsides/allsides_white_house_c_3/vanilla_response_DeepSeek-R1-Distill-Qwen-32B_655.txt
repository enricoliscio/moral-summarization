Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the U.S. and Russia reaching an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the U.S. and Russia have agreed to secure Syria's chemical weapons, which stops the threat of U.S. military action. It mentions that after two weeks of tension and Obama's failed attempt to get congressional support, a last-minute diplomatic push by Russia led to the deal.

Obama and Kerry are cautious, emphasizing verification. They don't trust Assad or Putin easily. The deal includes removing or destroying chemical weapons by 2014, inspections by November, and Syria must declare its arsenal within a week. Any violations go to the UN Security Council, where Russia can veto.

The article also notes that while the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing future attacks, it doesn't hold Assad accountable for the August attack. Critics like Sen. Corker doubt Syria's commitment. Experts say Obama wins substantively but loses politically because of domestic critics.

So, the summary should include the agreement, its terms, the cautious stance, the political implications, and expert opinions. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points without too much detail.

I'll start with the agreement and its impact on military action. Then mention the terms, the verification process, and the political skepticism. Finally, touch on the expert view on Obama's position.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, effectively halting the threat of U.S. military action. After weeks of tension and failed efforts by President Obama to gain support for a strike, a last-minute diplomatic push by Russia led to the deal. However, the Obama administration remains cautious, emphasizing verification and international inspections. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons by 2014, with inspections beginning by November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any violations would be addressed by the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power. While the deal meets Obama's goal of preventing future chemical attacks, it doesn't hold Syria accountable for the August 21 attack. Critics doubt Syria's commitment, and experts note Obama's political challenges despite the substantive win. END OF SUMMARY.
