SUMMARY:
The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. The deal was led by the Russians, saving the day after President Obama's unsuccessful effort to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike. While the Obama administration is cautious, with "eyes wide open," the agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014 and offer full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. The deal is far from perfect, requiring a "leap of faith" in trusting the Syrians and Russians to keep their part of the deal. Nevertheless, it offers the best way out of Obama's "unpopular" call for military action, and on the substance, it is a "win." However, the optics are "bad," and Obama is unlikely to get credit for it due to his "critics" at home. END OF SUMMARY.
