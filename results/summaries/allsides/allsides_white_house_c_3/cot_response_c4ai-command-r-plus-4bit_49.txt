SUMMARY: 
A diplomatic solution to secure Syria's chemical weapons has been reached between the U.S. and Russia, averting the threat of U.S. military action. While this deal offers a way out of an unpopular call for military intervention by President Obama, it relies on trusting the Russians and Syrians to fulfill their commitments. The deal was struck by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, despite tense relations between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The agreement includes a timeline for the removal or destruction of Syria's chemical weapons by 2014 and international inspections starting in November. While the deal was cautiously welcomed, critics question Syria's willingness to follow through and the ability to hold the Assad regime accountable for future violations. Obama finds himself in a tricky situation, having to trust adversaries while facing domestic criticism. The outcome is a diplomatic win for Russia and a way out of military action for Obama, but the success hinges on the trustworthiness of all parties involved.
