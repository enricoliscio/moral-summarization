SUMMARY:

The US and Russia have reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively taking the threat of US military action off the table. This diplomatic push, led by the Russians, saves the day after two weeks of saber-rattling and an unsuccessful effort by President Obama to win congressional and public support for a limited military strike. The Obama administration is cautious, with eyes wide open, as they wade into the deal, which will be scrutinized by a distrustful Congress. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. Any violations will be taken to the UN Security Council for response. While the deal is far from perfect, it offers the best way out of Obama's unpopular call for military action, and if implemented, would meet his goal of taking away the Assad regime's ability to conduct another chemical attack.

END OF SUMMARY.
