Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The US and Russia have agreed on securing Syria's chemical weapons, which averted potential military action. The deal was a last-minute push by Russia, and the US is cautious about trusting Syria and Russia. The agreement includes timelines for removal or destruction of weapons, inspections, and a process for violations. 

I need to make sure the summary includes words like "push," "progress," "secure," "destroy," "leaked," "attacks," etc. I'll structure the summary to highlight the diplomatic effort, the cautious approach by the US, and the implications of the deal. 

I'll start by stating the agreement and its purpose, then mention the diplomatic push and the US's skepticism. Next, I'll outline the key terms of the deal, emphasizing verification and inspections. Finally, I'll note the political implications, such as how the US avoids military action but doesn't fully resolve responsibility for the attack. 

I'll ensure the summary stays under 200 words and includes as many of the specified moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. The goal is to convey the main points while maintaining the original moral framing.

SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia have reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons, effectively halting the threat of U.S. military action. This diplomatic push followed weeks of tension and failed efforts by President Obama to gain support for a military strike. While the deal is seen as progress, the Obama administration remains cautious, emphasizing the need to "verify and verify" Syria's commitments. Secretary of State John Kerry stressed the importance of concrete actions to ensure Assad's seriousness about relinquishing chemical weapons. The agreement requires Syria to remove or destroy its arsenal by 2014, with inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its stockpile within a week. Any violations would be addressed by the UN Security Council, where Russia retains veto power. The deal allows both sides to claim they maintained their positions on potential force for further violations. While the framework meets Obama's goal of preventing future chemical attacks, it leaves unanswered questions about Assad's responsibility for the August 21 attack that killed 1,400 civilians. Critics, like Sen. Bob Corker, doubt Syria's willingness to follow through. The deal is imperfect but offers Obama a way out of military action, though it may not garner him political credit. The agreement is seen as a diplomatic win for Russia and a step toward avoiding war, but its success hinges on trust and verification. END OF SUMMARY.
