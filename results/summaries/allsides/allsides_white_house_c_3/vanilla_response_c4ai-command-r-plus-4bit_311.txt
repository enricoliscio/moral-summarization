SUMMARY: The U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure Syria's chemical weapons, averting the threat of U.S. military action. While the deal was hailed as a diplomatic victory, it was met with skepticism by Congress due to distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. The deal includes a timeline for the removal or destruction of Syria's chemical weapons by 2014 and international inspections starting in November. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for verification and concrete actions by the Assad regime. The deal allows both sides to maintain their stance on the potential use of force for violations. President Obama acknowledged the challenges ahead but stated that the agreement meets his goal of preventing another chemical attack by the Assad regime. Critics argue that the agreement relies on trust and verification, with Syria's willingness to follow through remaining uncertain. The deal provides a way out of military action for Obama, but he may not receive credit due to domestic criticism.
END OF SUMMARY.
