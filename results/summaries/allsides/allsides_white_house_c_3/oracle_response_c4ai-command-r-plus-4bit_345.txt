SUMMARY: In a last-minute diplomatic push, the U.S. and Russia reached an agreement to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively removing the threat of U.S. military action. While the deal offers a way out of an unpopular call for military action by President Obama, it requires a leap of faith in trusting the Syrians and Russians to uphold their commitments. The agreement includes a timeline for the removal or destruction of Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, with international inspections beginning in November and full disclosure of its arsenal within a week. However, the deal has been met with skepticism by Congress, who are distrustful of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. Obama has acknowledged the challenges ahead, stating that much more work remains to be done and that concrete actions are needed to demonstrate Syria's seriousness in giving up its chemical weapons. The deal also raises questions about Syria's willingness to follow through and holds the potential for further disputes over the use of force for violations. Despite the challenges, the agreement meets Obama's goal of preventing another chemical attack by the Assad regime.
END OF SUMMARY.
