SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city, where local authorities do not assist federal immigration enforcement. Miyamoto stated that his department's focus is on public safety and that the community cannot be safe if members are afraid to report crimes due to fear of immigration consequences. As a result, the city will not honor ICE detainer requests, meaning that illegal aliens arrested for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE custody. This policy aligns with California's Values Act, which prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals to ICE. The announcement comes as the Trump administration has increasingly criticized California's sanctuary policies, specifically highlighting the dangers of releasing criminal illegal aliens back into communities. San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, has defended the city's stance, stating that they are committed to protecting all residents, including illegal aliens.
END OF SUMMARY.
