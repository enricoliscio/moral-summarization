SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, prioritizing the safety and well-being of its community members, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants. Sheriff Miyamoto asserts that the policy promotes public safety by encouraging undocumented individuals to report crimes without fear of immigration enforcement. The directive means that local law enforcement will ignore ICE requests to transfer individuals in their custody, despite concerns about potential additional crimes being committed by released individuals. This announcement aligns with California's Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals into ICE custody. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing dangers to public safety, and has taken legal action against the state's private detention facility law. San Francisco's Mayor, London Breed, defends the city's stance, stating their resilience and commitment to protecting their residents, regardless of their immigration status, against what they perceive as unfair targeting by the administration.
