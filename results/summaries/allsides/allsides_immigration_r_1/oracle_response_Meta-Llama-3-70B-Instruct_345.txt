SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, where community members are not afraid to report crimes. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, despite cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody. The directive is somewhat redundant, given California's existing laws that prohibit state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing the dangers they pose, including the case of a man killed by an illegal alien who was released back into the public. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about protecting illegal aliens, saying the city will fight against the Trump administration's attacks and protect its people. END OF SUMMARY.
