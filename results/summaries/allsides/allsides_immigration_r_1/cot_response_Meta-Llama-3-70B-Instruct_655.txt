SUMMARY:
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move cements San Francisco's status as a "sanctuary jurisdiction," prioritizing "public safety" over federal immigration enforcement. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes a "safe community" where members are not "afraid" to report crimes. Despite documented cases of "illegal aliens" committing additional crimes after release, the sheriff's department will ignore ICE detainer requests. This directive is seen as a bold move against the Trump administration's opposition to California's "sanctuary policies." San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about protecting "illegal aliens" and vows to fight against the administration's "unfair" attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
