SUMMARY:
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further cements San Francisco's status as a progressive sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as community members may be afraid to report crimes if they fear deportation. The sheriff's department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents, despite documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about the city's protection of illegal aliens, calling the Trump administration's opposition to the city's sanctuary policies unfair. The city will continue to fight against these attacks and protect its community. END OF SUMMARY.
