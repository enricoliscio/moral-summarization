SUMMARY: 
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to end their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision further cements the city's status as a progressive sanctuary jurisdiction, prioritizing the protection of its illegal alien residents. Miyamoto argues that his department's focus is on public safety and that a safe community cannot exist if community members fear reporting crimes due to immigration concerns. The directive means that local law enforcement will ignore ICE requests to transfer individuals in their custody, regardless of their immigration status. This policy aligns with California's Values Act, which already prohibits agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with the President highlighting the dangers of such practices during his State of the Union address. San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, defends the city's stance, stating their resilience and commitment to protecting their residents, despite feeling targeted by the administration's opposition to sanctuary cities. 
END OF SUMMARY.
