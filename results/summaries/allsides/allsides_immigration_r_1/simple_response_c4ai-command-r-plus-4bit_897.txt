SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that law enforcement in the city will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), cementing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto's directive states that his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents and will not transfer individuals in local custody to ICE custody, believing that this policy promotes public safety. This announcement further emphasizes San Francisco's progressive stance on immigration and its commitment to protecting illegal aliens, despite criticism and opposition from the Trump administration. The California Values Act already prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals to ICE custody. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defends the city's stance, stating their resilience and determination to fight against attacks and protect its residents. This decision reflects the moral values of compassion and inclusivity, prioritizing the well-being and safety of all community members, regardless of their immigration status, and reaffirming San Francisco's dedication to being a welcoming and just city.
END OF SUMMARY.
