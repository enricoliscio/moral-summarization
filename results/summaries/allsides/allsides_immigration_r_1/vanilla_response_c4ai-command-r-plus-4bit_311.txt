SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Miyamoto stated that his department's primary focus is public safety and that the community cannot be safe if its members fear reporting crimes due to immigration status. The policy means that ICE detainer requests will be ignored, and illegal aliens in local custody will not be transferred to federal custody. This announcement further cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city, a policy that has been criticized by the Trump administration. Despite this criticism, San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains committed to protecting illegal aliens, stating that the city will fight against attacks and protect its people. The California Values Act, in effect since 2018, already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. Miyamoto's directive aligns with this act and underscores California's stance as a sanctuary jurisdiction.
END OF SUMMARY.
