SUMMARY:
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further solidifies San Francisco's status as a progressive sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as community members will no longer be afraid to report crimes. The department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents, citing that immigration enforcement is a federal matter. This decision is in line with California's Values Act, which prohibits state and local agencies from working with ICE. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing the dangers of releasing illegal aliens back into the public. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about protecting the city's illegal aliens, calling the Trump administration's attacks unfair. END OF SUMMARY.
