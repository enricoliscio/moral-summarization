SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, where community members are not afraid to report crimes. Miyamoto argues that this policy promotes public safety, despite documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody. The directive is seen as redundant, given California's existing laws prohibiting state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. President Donald Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing the dangers they pose. The Trump administration has taken its opposition a step further, filing a complaint against a state law that prohibits private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about protecting illegal aliens, vowing to fight against the Trump administration's attacks and protect the people of the city.

END OF SUMMARY.
