SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), cementing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as individuals should not be "afraid" to report crimes. Despite cases of illegal aliens committing crimes and being released from custody, Miyamoto's department will not honor immigration detainers. The directive is in line with California's Values Act, which bars agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, inviting the brother of a man killed by an illegal alien as a guest to the State of the Union address. The Trump administration has also filed a complaint against a state law prohibiting the operation of private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defends the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating they will "fight against those attacks and protect the people."

END OF SUMMARY.
