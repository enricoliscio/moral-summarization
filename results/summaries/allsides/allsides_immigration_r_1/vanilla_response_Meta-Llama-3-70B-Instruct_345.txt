SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, where local authorities will not honor ICE detainer requests. Miyamoto argues that this policy promotes public safety, as it encourages community members to report crimes without fear of deportation. However, critics point out that this policy has led to cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody. The California Values Act, which has been in effect since 2018, already prohibits state and local agencies from working with ICE. The Trump administration has opposed California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers of such policies and the Department of Justice filing a complaint against a state law that prohibits private detention facilities.

END OF SUMMARY.
