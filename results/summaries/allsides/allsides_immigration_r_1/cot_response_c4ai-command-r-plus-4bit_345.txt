SUMMARY:
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to end their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), cementing the city's status as a progressive sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that his department's focus is on promoting public safety and that a safe community cannot exist if community members are afraid to report crimes due to fear of immigration enforcement. The directive means that local law enforcement will ignore immigration detainers lodged by federal agents and refuse to transfer individuals in local custody to ICE custody. This stance aligns with California's Values Act, which already prohibits agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with the President highlighting the dangers of such policies in his State of the Union address, inviting the brother of a man killed by an illegal alien as his guest. The administration also filed a complaint against a state law prohibiting private detention facilities. San Francisco's Mayor, London Breed, defends the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating their resilience and commitment to fighting against unfair targeting.
