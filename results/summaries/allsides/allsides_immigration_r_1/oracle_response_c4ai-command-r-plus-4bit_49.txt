SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), further cementing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as individuals should not be afraid to report crimes, despite cases of illegal aliens committing crimes post-release from local custody. The directive aligns with California's Values Act, barring agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. President Trump criticized California's sanctuary policies during his State of the Union address, citing the release of an illegal alien who later killed someone. The DOJ also challenged a state law prohibiting private detention facilities. San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, vowed to fight against these attacks and protect the city's residents, despite feeling targeted by the Trump administration. Miyamoto's decision reinforces San Francisco's stance against assisting federal immigration enforcement, prioritizing the safety and well-being of the community.
END OF SUMMARY.
