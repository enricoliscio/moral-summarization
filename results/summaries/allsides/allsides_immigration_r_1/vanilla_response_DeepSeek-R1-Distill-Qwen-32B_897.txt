Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the main points are about San Francisco's law enforcement not cooperating with ICE anymore. The new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, made this announcement. He says they won't honor ICE detainers because it's a federal matter, and their focus is public safety. He believes that if people are afraid to report crimes, the community isn't safe. 

The article mentions that San Francisco has long opposed ICE cooperation, so this is just reinforcing their stance as a sanctuary city. The California Values Act, which went into effect in 2018, already restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers, so Miyamoto's directive might not be adding much new. 

President Trump criticized California's sanctuary policies in his State of the Union, highlighting a case where an illegal alien was released and later killed someone. The Trump administration is also suing California over a law that stops private detention facilities, which they see as an attempt to prevent detaining aliens. 

The mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, supports the sanctuary policies and feels the city is being unfairly targeted by the Trump administration.

So, the summary should include the key points: new sheriff's directive, refusal to help ICE, focus on public safety, context of California's existing laws, Trump's criticism, and the mayor's support.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure to include all these elements concisely.

SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected Sheriff Paul Miyamoto has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reinforcing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto stated that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is the department's priority. His directive means local authorities will ignore ICE detainers, preventing the transfer of individuals into ICE custody. This policy aligns with California's Values Act, which prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers, a law in effect since 2018. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing cases where illegal aliens released due to such laws committed crimes. The Trump administration has also filed a complaint against California for banning private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city's sanctuary policies, stating it would continue to protect its residents. END OF SUMMARY.
