Alright, I need to summarize this news article about San Francisco's new policy regarding ICE cooperation. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main points are: San Francisco's sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has decided not to cooperate with ICE, making San Francisco a sanctuary city. He argues that this promotes public safety because people won't be afraid to report crimes. The article mentions the California Values Act, which already restricts cooperation with ICE, and Trump's criticism, including the example of an illegal alien who committed a crime after being released. The mayor supports the policy, saying the city is resilient and will protect its people.

I need to highlight the moral arguments on both sides. Miyamoto's stance is about community trust and public safety. Trump's side points to dangers from illegal aliens. I should present both perspectives without bias, keeping the moral framing intact.

I'll structure the summary to include Miyamoto's announcement, the reasoning behind it, the existing state law, Trump's criticism with the example, and the mayor's support. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and balanced.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language formal as per the user's request. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. Let me draft this, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral aspects are preserved.

SUMMARY:  
San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reinforcing the city’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argued that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is prioritized when community members feel safe reporting crimes. His department will ignore ICE detainers, meaning illegal aliens in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE. While Miyamoto claims this promotes public safety, critics point to cases where illegal aliens have committed additional crimes after release. California’s Values Act, in effect since 2018, already restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers. President Trump has criticized sanctuary policies, citing cases like an illegal alien who killed a man after being released due to such laws. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s stance, calling it resilient and committed to protecting its residents despite federal opposition.  
END OF SUMMARY.
