Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific steps: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a summary using those words as much as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I should go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "cooperating," "oppose," "sanctuary," "public safety," "afraid," "crimes," "illegal aliens," "transfer," "promotes," "documented," "dangers," "targeted," "protect," "attacks," "unfairly," "strong," "resilient," "fight." These words seem to carry moral weight because they relate to cooperation, opposition, safety, fear, crime, immigration enforcement, and protection.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The key points are:

- San Francisco's sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, is not cooperating with ICE.
- This makes San Francisco a sanctuary city.
- The reasoning is that public safety is better when people aren't afraid to report crimes.
- They won't honor ICE detainers, so even if someone is in custody for another crime, ICE can't take them.
- There are documented cases where illegal aliens commit more crimes after release, but Miyamoto says it's about public safety.
- California's Values Act already limits ICE cooperation since 2018.
- Trump criticized California, highlighting a case where an illegal alien killed someone after being released due to the law.
- The Trump administration is suing over a law banning private detention facilities.
- Mayor Breed says they're being unfairly targeted but will protect people.

I need to weave these points together, using the moral words identified. I should ensure the summary flows logically and includes all the key moral aspects without getting too bogged down in details.

**STEP 1:**

* Cooperating
* Oppose
* Sanctuary
* Public safety
* Afraid
* Crimes
* Illegal aliens
* Transfer
* Promotes
* Documented
* Dangers
* Targeted
* Protect
* Attacks
* Unfairly
* Strong
* Resilient
* Fight

**SUMMARY:**

San Francisco's sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city will no longer cooperate with ICE, solidifying its status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that public safety is paramount, and community trust is eroded when residents fear reporting crimes. The city will ignore ICE detainers, meaning even if an illegal alien is in custody for another crime, they won't be transferred to ICE. While there are documented cases of illegal aliens committing further crimes after release, Miyamoto maintains this policy promotes public safety. California's Values Act, in effect since 2018, already restricts ICE cooperation, making transfers difficult. President Trump criticized California, citing a case where an illegal alien killed someone after being released due to the law. The Trump administration is suing over a state law banning private detention facilities. Mayor London Breed claims the city is unfairly targeted but remains committed to protecting its residents, emphasizing San Francisco's strength and resilience in the face of these challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
