Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about San Francisco's decision not to cooperate with ICE. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article says that San Francisco's new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has decided that the local law enforcement won't help with federal immigration enforcement. He made this announcement to a local media outlet. San Francisco has been against cooperating with ICE for a long time, so this makes it even more of a sanctuary city.

Miyamoto mentioned that their department isn't involved in immigration enforcement because that's a federal matter. He believes their focus should be on public safety. If people are afraid to report crimes because they might be deported, that's bad for community safety. So, his department won't honor ICE detainers. That means if someone is in custody for another crime, ICE can't transfer them into their custody.

The article also mentions that this policy might not be new because California already has the California Values Act since 2018, which restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers. So, San Francisco's move is in line with the state law.

President Trump criticized California's sanctuary policies in his State of the Union address, highlighting a case where an illegal alien who had an ICE detainer was released and later killed someone. Trump's administration is opposing California's policies, even suing over a law that stops private detention facilities.

San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, supports the sanctuary policies and thinks the city is being unfairly targeted by Trump. She's determined to protect the city's residents.

So, the main points are:
- San Francisco's sheriff stops cooperation with ICE.
- This reinforces the city's sanctuary status.
- Miyamoto focuses on public safety, fearing community distrust if people are afraid to report crimes.
- California's Values Act already limits ICE cooperation, so this is an extension of that.
- Trump criticizes California, citing a case where an illegal alien was released and later committed a crime.
- The Trump administration is suing over California's ban on private detention facilities.
- Mayor Breed supports the policies and feels the city is unfairly targeted.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, making sure to include all key points without getting too detailed. I should avoid any markdown and keep it clear and concise.
