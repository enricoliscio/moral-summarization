SUMMARY: Law enforcement in San Francisco will no longer work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as directed by the newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto. This decision cements the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, prioritizing the protection of its illegal alien residents. Miyamoto argues that his department's focus is on public safety, and that a safe community cannot exist if its members are afraid to report crimes. Despite cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody, Miyamoto's directive stands. This decision aligns with the California Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. San Francisco's stance on immigration has drawn criticism from the Trump administration, with President Trump highlighting the dangers of sanctuary policies in his State of the Union address. The administration has taken legal action against California's sanctuary policies, with the Department of Justice filing a complaint against a state law prohibiting private detention facilities. San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, defends the city's position, stating their commitment to fighting against attacks and protecting its residents.
END OF SUMMARY.
