SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Miyamoto declared that his department will not be involved in immigration enforcement, arguing that it is a federal matter and that their focus is on public safety. Specifically, the department will not honor immigration detainer requests from ICE, meaning that illegal aliens in local custody will not be transferred to federal custody. This directive further cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city, a policy that has been criticized by President Trump and the Department of Justice. The California Values Act, in effect since 2018, already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has defended the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating that they will fight against attacks and protect the people of the city.

END OF SUMMARY.
