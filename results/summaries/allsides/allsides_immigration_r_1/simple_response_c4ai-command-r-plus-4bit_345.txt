SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that law enforcement in the city will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), cementing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto's directive states that his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents and will not transfer individuals in local custody to ICE custody, citing public safety as the main priority. This announcement further reinforces California's stance against ICE cooperation, as the California Values Act already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers during his State of the Union address. Despite the opposition, San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains committed to protecting illegal aliens, stating that the city will fight against attacks and continue to prioritize the safety of its residents. Miyamoto's decision aligns with the city's progressive values and emphasizes the importance of public safety over federal immigration enforcement.
