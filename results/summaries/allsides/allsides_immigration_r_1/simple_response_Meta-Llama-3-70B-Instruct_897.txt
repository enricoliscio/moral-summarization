SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, prioritizing public safety over immigration enforcement. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as community members may be afraid to report crimes if they fear deportation. The directive comes despite documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody. California's Values Act, in effect since 2018, already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing the dangers they pose. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains committed to protecting illegal aliens, despite the Trump administration's opposition. The city's stance is a testament to its progressive values and commitment to protecting its community members.

END OF SUMMARY.
