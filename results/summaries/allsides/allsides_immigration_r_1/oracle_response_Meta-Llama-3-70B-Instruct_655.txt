SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, where community members are no longer afraid to report crimes. Miyamoto argues that this policy promotes public safety, despite documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody. The directive is somewhat redundant, given California's existing laws prohibiting cooperation with ICE. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing cases like the killing of a man by an illegal alien who was released back into the public due to the California Values Act. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about protecting illegal aliens, saying the city will fight against the Trump administration's attacks and protect its people.

END OF SUMMARY.
