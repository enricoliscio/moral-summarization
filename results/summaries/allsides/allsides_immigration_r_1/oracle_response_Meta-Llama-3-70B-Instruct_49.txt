SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to cease cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), solidifying the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that this policy promotes public safety, as community members are "afraid" to report "crimes" if they fear deportation. The department will no longer honor ICE detainer requests, even if an illegal alien is arrested for an unrelated "crime". This move is seen as a direct challenge to the Trump administration, which has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing cases where illegal aliens have committed additional "crimes" after being released from local custody. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has vowed to "fight" against the administration's "attacks” and "protect” the city's residents, including illegal aliens. The city's stance is seen as a beacon of resistance against the federal government's efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities.

END OF SUMMARY.
