SUMMARY: Newly elected sheriff of San Francisco, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that his department will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), cementing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto, the first Asian American sheriff of the city, stated that his department's primary focus is public safety and that the community cannot be safe if its members fear reporting crimes due to immigration concerns. He argues that ignoring ICE detainer requests promotes public safety, despite cases of released illegal aliens committing additional crimes. The directive aligns with California's Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. San Francisco's stance on protecting illegal aliens has drawn criticism from the Trump administration, with the Department of Justice filing a complaint against a state law prohibiting private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defends the city's position, vowing to fight against attacks and protect its residents. Miyamoto's decision further reinforces San Francisco's commitment to shielding illegal aliens from federal immigration enforcement, prioritizing the perceived safety of undocumented immigrants over the actual safety of the public.
END OF SUMMARY.
