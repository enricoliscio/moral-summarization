Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about San Francisco's decision not to cooperate with ICE, led by the new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto. He's the first Asian American sheriff there. The city has long been a sanctuary, opposing ICE cooperation. Miyamoto's department won't honor ICE detainers, meaning even if someone is in custody for another crime, they won't transfer them to ICE. He argues this promotes public safety because people won't fear reporting crimes.

But there are counterpoints: some argue that releasing undocumented immigrants leads to more crimes, as in the case mentioned where someone killed a man after being released because of the law. Trump criticized California's sanctuary policies, bringing the victim's brother to the State of the Union. The California Values Act from 2018 restricts cooperation, and the Trump admin is suing over a law banning private detention facilities.

Mayor Breed supports the city's stance, saying they're being unfairly targeted but will protect their people.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no more than 200 words, preserving the moral framing. So I need to highlight the pro-sanctuary stance and the arguments on both sides.

I should start by stating the decision, mention Miyamoto, the reasoning about public safety, the opposition from Trump and the example given, the legal context with the California Values Act, and the mayor's support.

I need to keep it concise, making sure each point is clear but brief. Also, ensure that the moral arguments are presented from both sides: the city's focus on safety and community trust vs. the federal government's stance on enforcing immigration laws and public safety concerns.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each key point is included without exceeding the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to make sure it's under 200.

SUMMARY:  
San Francisco’s new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), solidifying the city’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto, the first Asian American sheriff of San Francisco, stated that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is the department’s priority. He argued that communities cannot be safe if residents fear reporting crimes due to immigration concerns. The policy includes ignoring ICE detainers, meaning undocumented individuals in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE. While Miyamoto claims this promotes public safety, critics point to cases where undocumented individuals released under such policies have committed additional crimes. President Trump has criticized California’s sanctuary policies, citing a case where an undocumented individual with an ICE detainer killed a man after being released. The California Values Act, in effect since 2018, already restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers. The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California over a law banning private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s stance, stating it would continue protecting its residents despite federal opposition.  
END OF SUMMARY.
