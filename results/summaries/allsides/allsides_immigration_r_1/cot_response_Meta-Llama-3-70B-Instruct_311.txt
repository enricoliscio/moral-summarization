SUMMARY:
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), further solidifying the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that this policy promotes public safety, as community members will no longer be afraid to report crimes. The sheriff's department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents, citing that immigration enforcement is a federal matter. This move is seen as a bold stance against the Trump administration's opposition to California's sanctuary policies, which the president has deemed "dangers" to public safety. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about the city's protection of illegal aliens, calling the Trump administration's actions "unfair" and vowing to fight against them. END OF SUMMARY.
