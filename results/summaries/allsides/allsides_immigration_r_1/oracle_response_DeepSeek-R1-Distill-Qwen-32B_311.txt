Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I have to make sure those are included in the summary. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should come after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. San Francisco's new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has decided that the law enforcement won't cooperate with ICE. This is part of making San Francisco a sanctuary city. The author uses words like afraid, crimes, killed, etc., so I need to incorporate those.

The article mentions that San Francisco has opposed ICE cooperation for a while, but this directive solidifies that stance. Miyamoto says their focus is public safety, and if people are afraid to report crimes, it's bad for safety. They won't honor ICE detainers, meaning even if someone is in custody for another crime, ICE can't take them. The author points out that some illegal aliens have committed more crimes after release, which is a counterargument to Miyamoto's claim.

California's Values Act from 2018 already restricts cooperation, so this directive isn't entirely new. Trump criticized California, mentioning a case where an illegal alien killed someone after being released due to the law. The Trump administration is suing over a law that stops private detention centers, which they see as anti-immigration. The mayor supports the sanctuary policy, saying they're protecting people despite being targeted.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary, keeping the moral words. I should mention San Francisco's decision, the sheriff's reasoning, the impact on public safety, the ICE detainers, the counterargument with crimes, the California law, Trump's criticism, the killing incident, the legal action, and the mayor's support.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral terms. Let me try to structure it step by step, ensuring each point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: San Francisco's new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with ICE, reinforcing its status as a sanctuary city. Miyamoto emphasized that public safety is the department's priority, arguing that communities cannot be safe if people are afraid to report crimes. The directive means ICE detainers will be ignored, even if an illegal alien is in custody for another crime. However, critics point out that some illegal aliens have committed additional crimes after being released. California's Values Act, in effect since 2018, already prohibits honoring ICE detainers, limiting federal immigration enforcement. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing cases where illegal aliens have killed Americans after being released. The Trump administration is challenging a state law that prohibits private detention facilities, which they claim aims to stop detaining aliens. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating they are being unfairly targeted but will fight to protect their residents. END OF SUMMARY.
