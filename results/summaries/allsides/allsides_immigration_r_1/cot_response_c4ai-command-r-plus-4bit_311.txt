SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to cease cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This directive cements the city's status as a progressive sanctuary for illegal aliens, prioritizing public safety and the reporting of crimes over immigration enforcement. Miyamoto argues that his department's role is to serve the community, and by ignoring immigration detainers, they promote a safe environment where community members feel secure. California's Values Act already prohibits local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests, preventing the transfer of individuals into federal custody. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers of such policies in his State of the Union address. The administration further demonstrated its opposition by filing a complaint against a state law prohibiting private detention facilities. San Francisco's Mayor, London Breed, defends the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating their resilience and determination to fight against attacks and protect its residents. END OF SUMMARY.
