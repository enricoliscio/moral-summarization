SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, where community members are no longer afraid to report crimes. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, despite documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody. The directive comes despite California's existing law, the California Values Act, which prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. President Donald Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, highlighting the dangers of releasing illegal aliens back into the public. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about protecting illegal aliens, vowing to fight against the Trump administration's attacks on the city. The city will continue to protect its community members, despite being unfairly targeted by the federal government.

END OF SUMMARY.
