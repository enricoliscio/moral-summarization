SUMMARY:
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to end all cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, cementing the city's status as a progressive sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that his department's focus is on public safety and that immigration enforcement is a federal matter. He pledges to ignore ICE requests to transfer individuals in local custody, even if they are illegal aliens, as he believes this promotes public safety. This directive is seen as redundant given that California law already prohibits agencies from honouring ICE detainer requests, making it impossible to directly transfer individuals into ICE custody. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, highlighting a case where an illegal alien, released due to the California Values Act, killed a man. The administration has filed a complaint against a state law barring private detention facilities, intending to forbid the detention of aliens in the state. San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, defends the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating their resilience and determination to fight against attacks and protect its residents. END OF SUMMARY.
