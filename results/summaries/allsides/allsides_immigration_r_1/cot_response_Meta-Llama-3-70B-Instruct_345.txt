SUMMARY:
San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision further solidifies San Francisco's status as a progressive sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as it allows community members to feel safe reporting crimes without fear of deportation. The directive prohibits the honoring of immigration detainers lodged by federal agents, despite concerns that it may lead to the release of illegal aliens who may commit additional crimes. The move is seen as a pushback against the Trump administration's opposition to California's sanctuary policies, which the president has deemed dangerous. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains adamant about protecting the city's illegal aliens, calling the city "strong" and "resilient" in the face of federal attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
