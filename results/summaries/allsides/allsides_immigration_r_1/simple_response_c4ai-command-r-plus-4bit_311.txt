SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that law enforcement in the city will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), cementing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto's directive states that his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents and will not transfer individuals in local custody to ICE custody, citing public safety and the importance of community trust as reasons for the policy. This announcement aligns with the California Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals to ICE. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers of such policies in his State of the Union address. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has defended the city's protection of undocumented immigrants, stating that the city will fight against attacks and protect its residents. Miyamoto's decision reinforces San Francisco's commitment to inclusive and just practices, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, can access public safety services without fear of deportation or detention. This moral stance prioritizes the well-being and rights of the community and sends a powerful message of solidarity and support to undocumented residents.
END OF SUMMARY.
