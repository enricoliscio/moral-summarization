Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about San Francisco's decision not to cooperate with ICE, which is part of their sanctuary city policy. The sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, is emphasizing public safety and community trust. I should highlight how this decision is seen as a moral stance against federal immigration enforcement.

I also need to include the counterarguments, like the president's criticism and the example of the illegal alien involved in a crime. It's important to balance both perspectives to maintain the moral framing. I'll make sure to mention the California Values Act and the federal government's response, showing the tension between state and federal policies.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the sheriff's directive, the reasons behind it, the opposition from the federal side, and the broader implications. I'll structure it to show both sides' moral arguments—San Francisco's focus on community safety versus the federal concern over illegal aliens committing crimes.

Let me make sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll start with the main action, then explain the reasoning, mention the criticism, and conclude with the ongoing debate. That should cover the moral aspects effectively.

SUMMARY: San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), solidifying the city’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto emphasized that his department focuses on public safety, arguing that community trust is compromised when residents fear reporting crimes due to immigration concerns. The policy includes ignoring ICE detainers, meaning individuals in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE. Miyamoto defends this stance as promoting public safety, despite critics pointing to cases where illegal aliens have committed additional crimes after release. California’s Values Act, in effect since 2018, already restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers, aligning with San Francisco’s new directive. President Trump has criticized such sanctuary policies, citing instances where they allegedly endanger public safety. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has taken legal action against California for prohibiting private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed supports the city’s stance, asserting its commitment to protecting residents despite federal opposition. The debate highlights conflicting moral priorities: public safety and community trust versus federal immigration enforcement and national security. END OF SUMMARY.
