SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto stated that his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents, citing that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is compromised when community members are afraid to report crimes. This move is seen as redundant, given that California's Values Act already prohibits state and local agencies from working with ICE. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers of such policies in his State of the Union address. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has vowed to continue protecting illegal aliens, despite the Trump administration's opposition.

END OF SUMMARY.
