SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected Sheriff Paul Miyamoto has announced that his department will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto stated that his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents, citing public safety concerns. This means that if an illegal alien is arrested for an unrelated crime, ICE's request to transfer them into their custody will be ignored. While critics argue that this policy could lead to additional crimes being committed by released illegal aliens, Miyamoto believes it promotes public safety by encouraging community members to report crimes without fear of deportation. The directive is largely redundant, as California's Values Act already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. The Trump administration has been vocal in its opposition to California's sanctuary policies, with Attorney General William Barr recently announcing a complaint against a state law that prohibits private detention facilities.

END OF SUMMARY.
