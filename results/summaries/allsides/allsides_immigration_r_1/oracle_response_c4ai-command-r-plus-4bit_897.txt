SUMMARY: Law enforcement in San Francisco will no longer collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as directed by the newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto. This decision reinforces San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, prioritizing the protection of its community members, regardless of their immigration status. Sheriff Miyamoto asserts that public safety is enhanced when community members feel safe to report crimes without fear of immigration repercussions. This policy means that local law enforcement will ignore immigration detainer requests from ICE, even if an individual has been placed in local custody for an unrelated crime. The directive aligns with California's Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals into ICE custody. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing instances where illegal aliens have committed crimes after being released from local custody. San Francisco's Mayor, London Breed, defends the city's stance, stating their commitment to protecting their residents despite feeling targeted by the federal government. This decision underscores the city's resolve to promote a safe and inclusive environment for all its inhabitants.

END OF SUMMARY.
