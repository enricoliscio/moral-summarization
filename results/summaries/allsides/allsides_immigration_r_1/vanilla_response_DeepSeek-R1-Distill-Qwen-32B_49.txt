Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about San Francisco's new sheriff deciding not to cooperate with ICE. They specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main points are: Paul Miyamoto, the new sheriff, has decided that San Francisco law enforcement won't help ICE. This continues the city's stance as a sanctuary city. Miyamoto's reasoning is that immigration enforcement is a federal matter, and public safety is their priority. They won't honor ICE detainers, meaning even if someone is arrested for another crime, ICE can't take them. He argues this promotes safety, though there are cases where released immigrants commit more crimes. California's Values Act already restricts cooperation since 2018. Trump criticized California in his State of the Union, mentioning a case where an illegal alien with a detainer was released and later killed someone. The Trump administration is fighting against California's sanctuary policies, including suing over a law banning private detention centers. Mayor Breed supports the city's stance, saying they're being unfairly targeted.

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll start with the main action: the sheriff's decision. Then explain it's part of San Francisco's sanctuary policy. Mention the refusal to honor ICE detainers and Miyamoto's reasoning. Include the existing California law and Trump's criticism, referencing the specific case. Also, note the legal action against California and the mayor's response.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering all key points without getting too detailed. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. Let me check the word count as I go to make sure it's within the limit. 

I think I've covered all the essential elements. Now, I'll structure it into a few sentences, making sure each point is clear and transitions smoothly. Finally, I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision reinforces San Francisco’s status as a sanctuary city, aligning with its long-standing opposition to federal immigration enforcement. Miyamoto stated that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is the department’s priority. The sheriff’s office will not honor ICE detainers, meaning individuals in local custody with ICE holds will not be transferred. Miyamoto argued that this policy promotes community safety, though critics point to cases where released immigrants have committed additional crimes. California’s Values Act, enacted in 2018, already restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers. President Trump has criticized California’s sanctuary policies, citing cases where immigrants with detainers were released and later committed crimes. The Trump administration has also sued California over a law banning private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s stance, stating it would continue to protect its residents. END OF SUMMARY.
