SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, prioritizing public safety over federal immigration enforcement. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as community members are more likely to report crimes if they are not afraid of being deported. Despite documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released from local custody, the sheriff's department will not honor ICE detainer requests. This directive is in line with California's Values Act, which prohibits state and local agencies from working with ICE. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing cases of illegal aliens committing crimes after being released from custody. However, San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains committed to protecting the city's immigrant community, calling the Trump administration's actions an unfair attack. END OF SUMMARY.
