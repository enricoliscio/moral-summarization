SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision further cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city, where local authorities do not enforce federal immigration laws. Miyamoto stated that his department's focus is on public safety and that the community cannot be safe if members are afraid to report crimes due to fear of deportation. As a result, the city will not honor ICE detainer requests, meaning that illegal aliens who are in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE custody. This announcement aligns with California's Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals to ICE. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers of such policies during his State of the Union address. San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, has defended the city's stance, stating that they will protect illegal aliens and fight against the administration's attacks.

END OF SUMMARY.
