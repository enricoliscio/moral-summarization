Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided by the author. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about San Francisco's sheriff deciding not to cooperate with ICE. The key points are: no more honoring ICE detainers, the sheriff's argument about public safety, the California Values Act, President Trump's criticism, and the mayor's defense.

I need to include words like afraid, crimes, killed, released, prohibits, targeted, fight, attacks, protect. I should make sure these words are part of the summary.

I should structure the summary to first mention the sheriff's decision, then the reasoning about public safety, reference the California Values Act, mention Trump's criticism with the example of the man killed, and conclude with the mayor's stance on protecting the city.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all the moral words are included naturally.

SUMMARY: San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Miyamoto emphasized that public safety is the department’s priority, stating that communities cannot be safe if members are afraid to report crimes. The policy means ICE detainers will be ignored, even if an individual is in local custody for unrelated crimes. While Miyamoto argues this promotes safety, critics point to cases where illegal aliens have committed additional crimes after release. California’s Values Act already prohibits honoring ICE detainers, a law the Trump administration has criticized, calling it a sanctuary policy that endangers public safety. President Trump highlighted a case where an illegal alien, with an ICE detainer, was released and later killed someone. The administration has also targeted California’s prohibition on private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s stance, stating they will fight against federal attacks and protect residents. END OF SUMMARY.
