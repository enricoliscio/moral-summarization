Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the assistant should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points and the emotionally charged words used.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. San Francisco's sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has decided not to cooperate with ICE, making the city a sanctuary. He argues that this promotes public safety because people won't be afraid to report crimes. The article also mentions the California Values Act, which limits cooperation with ICE, and President Trump's criticism, including an example where an illegal alien was released and later committed a crime.

The user provided a list of morally framed words: afraid, crimes, crime, killed, released, prohibits, targeted, fight, attacks, protect. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should start by stating the main action: San Francisco's sheriff refusing ICE cooperation. Then, mention the reasoning about public safety and fear. Include the part about ignoring ICE detainers and the impact on immigration enforcement. Also, touch on the California Values Act and Trump's criticism, using the example of the man killed by an illegal alien. Finally, note the mayor's response about fighting against attacks and protecting residents.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral language. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each key point is covered without losing the emotional weight of the original text.

SUMMARY:  
San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), further solidifying the city’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto emphasized that public safety is the department’s priority, arguing that communities cannot be safe if residents are afraid to report crimes. The policy prohibits honoring ICE detainers, meaning individuals in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE custody. While this approach aims to protect public safety, critics point to documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after being released. California’s Values Act, in effect since 2018, already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers, making such transfers nearly impossible. President Trump has criticized sanctuary policies, citing cases like an illegal alien released due to the law who later killed a man. The Trump administration has also targeted California by challenging state laws that prohibit private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s stance, stating it would fight against federal attacks and protect its residents. END OF SUMMARY.
