Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about San Francisco's decision not to cooperate with ICE. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, the original article seems to present both sides but leans into the moral arguments from both the city and the federal side.

First, I should identify the key points. San Francisco's sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has decided that the department won't help ICE. They've long opposed cooperation, so this is just reinforcing their stance as a sanctuary city. Miyamoto's argument is about public safety, saying that if people are afraid to report crimes, the community isn't safe. He also mentions not honoring ICE detainers, which means if someone is in custody for another crime, ICE can't take them.

On the other side, the article mentions President Trump's criticism, highlighting a case where an illegal alien with a detainer was released and later committed a crime. The California Values Act from 2018 already limits cooperation, making Miyamoto's directive somewhat redundant. The Trump administration is opposing California's policies, even suing over a law that stops private detention facilities.

The summary needs to capture both the city's stance on public safety and the federal opposition, including the moral arguments each side presents. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure to include the main points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with Miyamoto's announcement, mention the public safety reasoning, note the existing California law, then Trump's criticism and the lawsuit. Also, include the mayor's response about protecting the city. Make sure to highlight the moral framing, like how the city sees it as a safety issue and the federal side sees it as a danger.

I need to ensure that the summary is balanced but reflects the original article's framing, which seems to present both sides but perhaps leans into the conflict between state and federal policies. I should avoid taking sides but present the moral arguments each side is making.

Wait, the original article does mention that there are documented cases of illegal aliens committing more crimes after release, which is a counterpoint to Miyamoto's argument. I should include that to show the debate's complexity.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with the announcement, the reasoning, the existing law, the federal response, and the ongoing conflict. Keeping it concise and within the word limit is key.

SUMMARY:  
San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reaffirming the city’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argued that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is prioritized when community members feel safe reporting crimes. The department will not honor ICE detainers, meaning individuals in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE. Miyamoto emphasized that this policy promotes public safety, though critics point to cases where illegal aliens have committed additional crimes after release. California’s Values Act, in effect since 2018, already limits cooperation between state and local agencies and ICE. President Trump has criticized California’s sanctuary policies, citing cases where releases led to violent crimes. The Trump administration has also sued California over a law banning private detention facilities for immigrants. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s stance, stating they would continue protecting residents despite federal opposition.  
END OF SUMMARY.
