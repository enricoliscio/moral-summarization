Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand all the requirements.

The user provided a news article about San Francisco's new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, who has decided that the law enforcement in San Francisco won't cooperate with ICE anymore. The article talks about the city's stance as a sanctuary jurisdiction, the California Values Act, and the political implications with the Trump administration.

The user also listed specific morally framed words from the article: afraid, crimes, crime, killed, released, prohibits, targeted, fight, attacks, protect. They want the summary to include as many of these words as possible.

First, I need to identify the key points of the article. The main points are:

1. San Francisco's sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has decided not to cooperate with ICE.
2. This is part of the city's sanctuary policy, which aims to protect immigrants.
3. The sheriff's reasoning is that cooperation would make the community afraid to report crimes, thus harming public safety.
4. There are cases where illegal aliens have committed crimes after being released, which is a counterargument.
5. California's Values Act prohibits cooperation with ICE, making the sheriff's decision somewhat redundant.
6. President Trump criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing a case where an illegal alien killed someone after being released.
7. The Trump administration is taking legal action against California's laws related to immigration.
8. The mayor of San Francisco supports the sanctuary policy and sees the city as being targeted by the Trump administration.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, making sure to include the morally charged words. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral implications, such as fear, crime, protection, and conflict.

I'll start by introducing the sheriff's decision and the moral reasoning behind it. Then, I'll mention the counterargument about crimes committed after release. Next, I'll note the California Values Act and its role in this. Then, I'll include Trump's criticism and the example of the killing. Finally, I'll mention the legal actions and the mayor's response about being targeted and fighting to protect the city.

I should make sure to use the words like afraid, crimes, killed, released, prohibits, targeted, fight, attacks, protect. Let me check if each of these is included.

I think that's all. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reinforcing the city’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto stated that his department is focused on public safety and argued that communities would be afraid to report crimes if they feared immigration enforcement. The city will ignore ICE detainers, meaning individuals in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE. While Miyamoto claims this promotes public safety, critics point to cases where illegal aliens have committed additional crimes after being released. California’s Values Act, in effect since 2018, already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers. President Trump has criticized California’s sanctuary policies, citing a case where an illegal alien killed someone after being released due to the law. The Trump administration has also targeted California by challenging a state law that prohibits private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s decision to protect illegal aliens, stating that the city is being unfairly targeted and will fight against federal attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
