SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto's department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents, citing that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is their primary concern. This directive is somewhat redundant, as California's Values Act already prohibits state and local agencies from working with ICE. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing the dangers they pose. The Department of Justice has also filed a complaint against a state law that prohibits private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains committed to protecting illegal aliens, despite the Trump administration's opposition.

END OF SUMMARY.
