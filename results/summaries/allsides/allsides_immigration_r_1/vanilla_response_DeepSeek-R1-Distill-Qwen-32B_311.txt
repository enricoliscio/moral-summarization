Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about San Francisco's new sheriff not cooperating with ICE. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points. 

The article starts by saying that San Francisco's sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has decided that his department won't cooperate with ICE. He was elected in November 2019, and he made this announcement recently. San Francisco has been against working with ICE for a while, so this makes their stance even stronger as a sanctuary city. Miyamoto says their focus is on public safety, and if people are afraid to report crimes because of immigration issues, that's bad for safety. 

He specifically mentions they won't honor ICE detainers. So, if someone is in custody for another crime, ICE can't transfer them. There are cases where illegal aliens commit more crimes after being released, but Miyamoto thinks his policy helps public safety. 

The article also talks about California's Values Act from 2018, which limits how local agencies can work with ICE. Trump mentioned California in his State of the Union, pointing out the dangers of sanctuary policies, using a case where an illegal alien killed someone after being released. The Trump admin is fighting against California's laws, like the one against private detention centers. The mayor of SF, London Breed, says they're being unfairly targeted but will keep protecting people.

So, the main points are: new sheriff's directive, no cooperation with ICE, focus on public safety, refusal to honor detainers, context of California's laws, Trump's criticism, and the mayor's response. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I should structure it logically, starting with the announcement, then the reasons, context, and the political backdrop. Make sure to mention the impact on public safety, the legal context with California's laws, Trump's stance, and the mayor's defense. 

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Maybe start with the announcement, then the reasoning, then the broader context with California and federal actions, and end with the political response. Let me try to piece it together concisely.

SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), solidifying the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto emphasized that public safety is the department's priority, stating that community trust is compromised when residents fear reporting crimes due to immigration concerns. The directive means ICE detainers will not be honored, preventing transfers of individuals in local custody to ICE. While Miyamoto argues this promotes safety, critics cite cases where released individuals commit further crimes. California's Values Act, enacted in 2018, already restricts local agencies from aiding ICE, aligning with Miyamoto's policy. President Trump has criticized sanctuary policies, highlighting risks like the release of an illegal alien who later committed a fatal crime. The Trump administration is challenging California's laws, including one banning private detention centers. Mayor London Breed defended the city's stance, asserting they will protect residents despite federal opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
