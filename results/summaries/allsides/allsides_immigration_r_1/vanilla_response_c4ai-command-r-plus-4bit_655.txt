SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that his department will no longer cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. This means that the city will not honor immigration detainers lodged by ICE agents and will ignore requests to transfer individuals from local custody to ICE custody. Miyamoto argues that this policy promotes public safety by encouraging community members, regardless of immigration status, to report crimes without fear. The directive aligns with California's existing laws, such as the California Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals to ICE custody. The announcement further cements San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city, a policy that has been criticized by the Trump administration. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has defended the city's stance, stating that they will fight against attacks and protect all residents.

END OF SUMMARY.
