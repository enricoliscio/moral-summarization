Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. They provided the article and specific instructions. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about San Francisco's new sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, deciding not to cooperate with ICE. He's the first Asian American sheriff there. San Francisco has been against ICE cooperation before, but this makes it more official as a sanctuary city. Miyamoto says they're focused on public safety and that immigration is a federal matter. They won't honor ICE detainers, meaning if someone is in local custody and ICE wants them, they'll ignore it. Miyamoto argues this promotes safety, even though there are cases where released aliens commit more crimes.

The California Values Act, which started in 2018, already restricts state and local agencies from helping ICE. Trump criticized California in his State of the Union, mentioning a case where an illegal alien killed someone after being released due to the law. The Trump administration is suing California over a law banning private detention facilities. The mayor supports this stance, saying they're protecting their people despite being targeted.

I need to summarize this into 200 words or less. I should include the key points: the sheriff's decision, the impact on San Francisco as a sanctuary city, the reasoning behind it, the existing California law, Trump's criticism, and the legal actions against California. Also, mention the mayor's support.

I'll structure it by starting with the sheriff's announcement, then the context of San Francisco's stance, the policy details, the reasoning, the California law, Trump's example, the legal battle, and the mayor's response. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each point is covered without going into too much detail. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. Also, remember to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." as per instructions.

SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision aligns with San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city and reflects Miyamoto's focus on public safety, stating that immigration enforcement is a federal matter. The department will ignore ICE detainers, meaning individuals in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE. Miyamoto argues this promotes safety, despite concerns about recidivism among undocumented individuals. California's Values Act, enacted in 2018, already restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers. President Trump recently criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing a case where an undocumented immigrant killed a man after being released due to the law. The Trump administration is also challenging California's ban on private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed supports the city's stance, asserting it will protect its residents despite federal opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
