SUMMARY:

San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that the city's law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision further solidifies San Francisco's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto stated that his department's focus is on public safety, and honoring ICE detainers would create fear among community members, preventing them from reporting crimes. The policy means that if an illegal alien is in local custody for an unrelated crime, ICE requests for transfer will be ignored. This move is seen as redundant, given California's existing laws prohibiting cooperation with ICE. President Trump has criticized California's sanctuary policies, citing cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after release. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has vowed to protect the city's illegal aliens, despite the Trump administration's opposition.

END OF SUMMARY.
