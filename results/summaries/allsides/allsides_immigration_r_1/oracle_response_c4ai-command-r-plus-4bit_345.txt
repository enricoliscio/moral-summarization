SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has directed law enforcement to cease cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), further cementing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety, as individuals should not be afraid to report crimes to the authorities regardless of their immigration status. He states that his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents and will ignore requests to transfer individuals in local custody to ICE. This directive aligns with California's Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers of such policies in his State of the Union address. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has defended the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating that they are being unfairly attacked and will continue to fight against these attacks to protect its residents.

END OF SUMMARY.
