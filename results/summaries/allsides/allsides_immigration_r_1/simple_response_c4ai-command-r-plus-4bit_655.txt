SUMMARY: San Francisco's newly elected sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has announced that law enforcement in the city will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reinforcing the city's status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto's directive states that his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents and will not transfer individuals in local custody to ICE custody, citing public safety as the main priority. This decision aligns with the California Values Act, which already prohibits state and local agencies from directly transferring individuals to ICE. The Trump administration has criticized California's sanctuary policies, with President Trump highlighting the dangers during his State of the Union address. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has defended the city's protection of illegal aliens, stating that they will fight against attacks and protect the people of the city. Miyamoto's announcement further solidifies San Francisco's commitment to inclusive and compassionate values, ensuring that all community members, regardless of immigration status, can feel safe reporting crimes without fear of deportation or family separation. This moral stance prioritizes the well-being and safety of all individuals and promotes a more inclusive and just society.
