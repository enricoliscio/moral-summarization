Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about San Francisco's decision not to cooperate with ICE. The sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, made this announcement. He says they won't honor ICE detainers because their focus is on public safety. The argument is that if people are afraid to report crimes, it's bad for the community. They mention that this isn't new because of the California Values Act, which limits cooperation since 2018. Trump criticized California, citing a case where an illegal alien was released and later committed a crime. The DOJ is suing over a law that stops private detention centers. The mayor supports sanctuary policies.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes all these points but in a concise way, under 200 words. I should highlight the moral arguments: public safety, community trust, and the conflict with federal policies. Also, note the criticism from Trump and the legal actions.

I should start by stating the directive, mention Miyamoto, the reason for not cooperating, the existing state law, Trump's criticism with the example, the legal challenge, and the mayor's support. Keep it clear and stick to the key points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Introduction of the directive, reasons behind it, context with the state law, federal criticism, legal actions, and the mayor's stance. Make sure each part is brief but covers the moral aspects.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and captures all the essential moral points the author presented.

SUMMARY: San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff Paul Miyamoto has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), solidifying the city’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Miyamoto stated that immigration enforcement is a federal matter and that public safety is the department’s priority. He argued that communities must feel safe to report crimes without fear of immigration consequences, though critics point to cases where illegal aliens have committed additional crimes after release. This directive aligns with California’s Values Act, enacted in 2018, which restricts state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainers. President Trump has criticized California’s sanctuary policies, citing cases like the release of an illegal alien who later committed a fatal crime. The Trump administration has also filed a lawsuit challenging a state law banning private detention facilities for immigrants. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s sanctuary policies, stating they protect residents despite federal opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
