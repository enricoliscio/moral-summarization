Alright, so I'm trying to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. They provided a news article about San Francisco's decision not to cooperate with ICE, along with specific instructions. The user wants two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and second, writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

I'll start by reading the article carefully. It's about Sheriff Miyamoto's directive to stop cooperating with ICE, the context of sanctuary cities, public safety concerns, and the political implications with the Trump administration.

For STEP 1, I need to extract all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "cooperating," "opposed," "sanctuary," "progressive," "public safety," "afraid," "illegal aliens," "promotes," "dangers," "unfairly targeted," "protection," etc. These words have strong moral implications and are used to frame the issue.

Next, for the summary, I have to condense the article into under 200 words, ensuring that the moral framing is preserved. I need to include the key points: the sheriff's decision, the reasoning behind it (public safety, community trust), the opposition from the Trump administration, the mention of the California Values Act, and the political tension.

I should make sure to use the identified morally framed words where appropriate. For example, using "sanctuary jurisdiction," "illegal aliens," "protection," and "targeted." I also need to present both sides: San Francisco's stance on public safety and the federal government's criticism regarding immigration enforcement and public safety risks.

I have to be concise but comprehensive, making sure the summary flows logically and covers all critical aspects without exceeding the word limit. I'll structure it by introducing the decision, explaining the reasoning, mentioning the state law, the federal opposition, and the political implications.

I should also be careful to maintain the original tone and framing, avoiding any bias beyond what's presented in the article. The summary should reflect the moral perspectives from both San Francisco and the federal side.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are included and that the morally framed words are appropriately used without making the summary too verbose. It's important that the summary is clear and meets the user's requirements precisely.

### SUMMARY:  
San Francisco’s newly elected Sheriff, Paul Miyamoto, has declared that the city’s law enforcement will no longer cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This decision reinforces San Francisco’s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction, prioritizing public safety over federal immigration enforcement. Miyamoto argued that fear of reporting crimes due to immigration concerns undermines community trust. The city will ignore ICE detainers, meaning illegal aliens in local custody for unrelated crimes will not be transferred to ICE. While Miyamoto claims this promotes public safety, critics point to cases where such individuals commit additional crimes after release. California’s Values Act already restricts local agencies from honoring ICE detainers, a law the Trump administration has criticized, calling it a danger to public safety. President Trump highlighted California as an example, citing a case where an illegal alien with an ICE detainer was released and later killed someone. The administration has also targeted California’s sanctuary policies, including a recent complaint against a state law banning private detention facilities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed defended the city’s protection of illegal aliens, stating they are unfairly targeted by the Trump administration.  
END OF SUMMARY.
