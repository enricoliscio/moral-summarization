Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Al Franken's resignation speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave, so I should focus on the key points the author emphasized. 

First, the article talks about how Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. He had apologized before but didn't do so in his resignation speech. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back his previous apologies. 

The author mentions a checklist for a good public apology: acknowledge harm, admit role, express remorse, explain future changes, and plan to make amends. Franken failed all these, especially not acknowledging the harm. 

He also denied some allegations and was vague about others, which undermines the women's credibility. The author criticizes him for choosing to protect his reputation over supporting the cause of protecting women. 

Franken's speech didn't contribute to the cause he claimed to care about. Instead, he made it harder to fight against injustices like Roy Moore and Trump's cases. 

So, the summary should highlight that Franken missed the opportunity to apologize properly, instead undermining his accusers and harming the cause. It should be concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral critique from the original article.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken's resignation speech after multiple sexual harassment allegations missed an opportunity for meaningful contrition. Instead of apologizing or acknowledging the harm caused, Franken focused on his own struggles, offered vague denials of the allegations, and even seemed to retract his earlier apologies. Sociologist David Karp’s checklist for effective apologies—acknowledging harm, admitting fault, expressing remorse, committing to change, and making amends—was entirely unmet. Franken’s vague denial of the allegations and focus on his own feelings further discredited the women who came forward, enabling doubters and critics of their claims. By prioritizing his reputation over accountability, Franken failed to support the cause of protecting women from harassment, instead hindering progress. His speech highlighted the broader injustice of men like Roy Moore and Donald Trump escaping accountability while accusers face backlash. Franken’s actions demonstrate how a missed opportunity for redemption can perpetuate systemic inequality and harm.  
END OF SUMMARY.
