SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he failed to apologize and focused on his own struggles, taking back his previous apologies and denying some of the allegations against him. This was a master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct. Franken's statement did not acknowledge the harm done, admit his role in it, express remorse, or explain how he would make amends. He claimed to be respectful of the broader conversation around harassment, but his words only served to harm the women who reported his misconduct. By going back on his earlier statements, Franken essentially took his accusers down with him, making it harder to fight against injustices like Roy Moore's probable entry into the Senate and Donald Trump's continued presidency. Franken's speech was a squandered opportunity to contribute to real change and protect women from men's abuses of power. END OF SUMMARY.
