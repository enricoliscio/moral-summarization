Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Al Franken's resignation speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about how Al Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. He had previously apologized but in his resignation speech, he didn't apologize again. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to backtrack on his previous apologies. The author uses a checklist for a good apology, which Franken didn't meet. He denied some allegations and didn't clearly explain his wrongdoing or how he'd change. The article criticizes him for not supporting the women who came forward and instead undermining their credibility. It also mentions the broader issue of injustice in politics, like Roy Moore and Trump not facing consequences, but Franken made it harder to fight these injustices by not taking responsibility.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points while highlighting the moral issues. It should be concise, under 200 words, and include the key moral failures of Franken. I'll start by mentioning his resignation and the women's accusations. Then, note his missed opportunity to apologize properly, the checklist he failed, his vague denials, and how he undermined the accusers. Finally, touch on the broader injustices and how his actions made it harder to address them.

Let me structure this step by step. First, introduce Franken's resignation and the context. Then, discuss his failure to apologize properly, referencing the checklist. Mention his vague denials and the impact on the women. Finally, tie it to the broader societal issues and his role in making progress harder.

I should ensure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. I'll check the word count after drafting to make sure it's under 200 words. Also, maintain the moral tone by emphasizing the missed opportunity to support the cause against harassment and the negative impact of his actions.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken's resignation speech after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment was widely criticized for failing to address the moral and emotional needs of the situation. Instead of apologizing and taking responsibility, Franken focused on his own struggles, offered vague denials of the allegations, and appeared to backtrack on his earlier apologies. His speech missed an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation on sexual harassment, instead undermining the women who came forward and reinforcing harmful stereotypes about accusers. By prioritizing his own reputation over accountability, Franken weakened the cause of protecting women from harassment and abuse. His actions highlighted a broader societal injustice, where powerful figures like Roy Moore and Donald Trump face fewer consequences for similar accusations. Frankenâ€™s failure to clearly acknowledge his wrongdoing and commit to change made it harder to fight these injustices, emphasizing the importance of genuine accountability in addressing sexual misconduct.  
END OF SUMMARY.
