SUMMARY: In his resignation speech, Senator Al Franken failed to apologize or express remorse for the sexual misconduct allegations made by multiple women. Instead, he offered vague denials and focused on his own struggles, taking back his previous apologies and squandering an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation about men's abuses of power. Franken's speech encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers and harmed the cause of protecting women from harassment. He chose to preserve his political legacy at the cost of sacrificing the women who came forward, making it harder to fight injustices perpetrated by men like Roy Moore and Donald Trump. Franken's actions and words were insincere and failed to acknowledge the harm he had done, demonstrating a lack of commitment to changing his behavior.

END OF SUMMARY.
