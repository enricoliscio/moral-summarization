SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he failed to apologize and focused on his own struggles, taking back previous apologies and denying some allegations. This is a masterclass in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct. Franken's statement fell short of the five-point checklist for a helpful public apology, which includes acknowledging harm, admitting role, expressing remorse, explaining future changes, and making amends. By not taking responsibility, Franken encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers and harmed the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. He chose to preserve his own reputation over doing good, making it harder to fight injustices like Roy Moore's probable entry into the Senate and Donald Trump's presidency despite allegations of sexual misconduct.

END OF SUMMARY.
