SUMMARY: Senator Al Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, including groping and harassment. In his resignation speech, Franken failed to apologize or take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and denied the allegations, taking back his previous apologies. Franken's speech lacked contrition and missed an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation about sexual harassment and men's abuses of power. By offering vague denials, he encouraged doubt and shame toward his accusers and harmed the cause of protecting women from such abuses. Franken sacrificed his accusers for his political legacy, making it harder to fight injustices like Roy Moore and Donald Trump's alleged misconduct. Franken's actions were insincere and failed to offer a clear explanation of what he did wrong or how he would change. His speech was a missed opportunity to do good and set a poor example for those accused of similar behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
