SUMMARY: Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and apologize sincerely to the women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, offered advice on running for office, and seemed to take back his previous apologies. Franken's statement failed to acknowledge the harm done, admit his role in it, express remorse, explain which behaviors he'll stop in the future, and share his plan for making amends. He denied some allegations and responded unclearly to others, leaving the women who came forward without a clear explanation of what he believes he did wrong and what he is committed to changing. By going back on his earlier statements, Franken essentially took all of his accusers down with him, making it harder to fight against sexual harassment and men's abuses of power. He chose to preserve his own reputation at the cost of harming the cause he claims to care about. END OF SUMMARY.
