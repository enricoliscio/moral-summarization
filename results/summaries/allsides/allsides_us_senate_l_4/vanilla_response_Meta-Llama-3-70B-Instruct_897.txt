SUMMARY:

Senator Al Franken's resignation speech failed to show contrition and apologize for his actions, instead focusing on his own struggles and giving advice on running for office. This was a missed opportunity to take responsibility and make amends. Franken's statement did not acknowledge the harm done, admit his role, express remorse, or explain how he would change his behavior in the future. Instead, he seemed to take back his previous apologies and denied some of the allegations against him. By doing so, he encouraged voters to doubt and shame his accusers, harming the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's speech was a "master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct." He had a choice to resign in a way that helped the cause or preserved his own reputation, and he chose the latter, making it harder to fight injustices like Roy Moore and Donald Trump remaining in power.

END OF SUMMARY.
