SUMMARY: Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech failed to apologize for his sexual misconduct and denied the harm he caused to his accusers. Earlier, Franken had apologized and admitted some wrongdoing, but in his speech, he took back his apologies and denied the allegations, saying some were "simply not true." Franken's statement squandered an opportunity to contribute to the conversation around sexual harassment and men's abuses of power. Instead of expressing remorse and committing to change, he focused on his own feelings and struggles. He offered vague denials, encouraged doubt and shame toward his accusers, and sacrificed their interests to preserve his political legacy. Franken's decision to prioritize his reputation over protecting his accusers made it harder to fight injustices and harmed the cause he claimed to care about. His speech was a missed chance to do good and set a poor example for those accused of similar misconduct. Franken's resignation highlights the unfairness of other accused men, like Roy Moore and Donald Trump, remaining in power despite allegations. Franken's choice to deny and take back apologies makes it more difficult to hold such men accountable and protect women from abuses of power.
END OF SUMMARY.
