SUMMARY: Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, announced his resignation from the Senate after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. In his speech, Franken failed to show genuine contrition or take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and denied some of the allegations, seemingly taking back his previous apologies. Franken missed an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation around sexual harassment and to offer a clear explanation of his actions and a plan for change. By prioritizing his own reputation over the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power, Franken sacrificed his accusers and made it more difficult to fight injustices. Franken's resignation highlights the unfairness of similar men, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump, retaining their positions of power despite facing similar or worse allegations. Franken's actions set a negative example of how not to respond to allegations of sexual misconduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
