SUMMARY: Sen. Al Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, including groping and harassment. In his resignation speech, Franken failed to apologize or express remorse for his actions, instead focusing on his own struggles and offering vague denials of the allegations. This was in contrast to his earlier apologies, in which he had acknowledged the harm he had caused and committed to changing his behavior. Franken's speech squandered an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation about sexual harassment and men's abuses of power. Instead, he chose to preserve his own reputation at the cost of harming his accusers and the broader cause of protecting women. By taking back his earlier apologies and denying the allegations, Franken encouraged doubt and shame toward his accusers and made it harder to fight injustices such as the election of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who have also been accused of misconduct. Franken's speech was a missed opportunity to do the right thing and help bring about real change in addressing sexual harassment.
END OF SUMMARY.
