SUMMARY: Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech was widely criticized for lacking a sincere apology and taking back previous apologies he had made. He missed an opportunity to show contrition and contribute to the broader conversation around sexual harassment and men's abuses of power. Franken was accused by multiple women of groping, kissing, or trying to kiss them without their consent. Instead of specifically acknowledging the harm done and expressing remorse, Franken focused on his own struggles and gave vague denials of the reports by his accusers. He also offered advice on running for office and seemed more concerned with preserving his reputation than with helping the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. By taking back his earlier apologies, Franken sacrificed his accusers and made it harder to fight injustices such as the fact that Roy Moore and Donald Trump, both accused of sexual misconduct, remain in power. Franken's speech was a missed opportunity to do the right thing and set a poor example for others accused of similar behavior.
END OF SUMMARY.
