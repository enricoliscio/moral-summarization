Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Al Franken resigning from the Senate after multiple women accused him of groping and sexual harassment. The author is critical of Franken's speech during his resignation, pointing out that he didn't apologize properly. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and gave advice on running for office, which the author sees as a missed opportunity to show contrition.

The author uses several morally charged words like "groped," "harassed," "squandered," "misconduct," "harm," "disrespectful," "kissed," "grabbed," "insincere," "denial," "shame," "ammunition," "protected," "preserved," "harming," "sacrificing," "unfair," "assault," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The key points are:
1. Franken resigned after women accused him of misconduct.
2. His speech didn't apologize properly; instead, he focused on himself.
3. He denied some allegations, which undermines the accusers.
4. The author believes he missed a chance to support the cause of protecting women.
5. The author compares this to other injustices, like Roy Moore and Trump remaining in power.

I should structure the summary to highlight Franken's failure to apologize, the impact on his accusers, and the broader implications of his actions. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many moral terms as possible.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral language.

SUMMARY: Al Franken resigned from the Senate after multiple women accused him of groping and harassment. His speech failed to apologize adequately, instead focusing on his own struggles and offering advice, squandering an opportunity to address misconduct. He denied some allegations, harming accusers and undermining efforts to protect women. By not clearly admitting fault or committing to change, Franken preserved his reputation but harmed the cause. His actions contrasted with injustices like Roy Moore and Trump's continued power, highlighting the unfairness of the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
