SUMMARY:
Al Franken's resignation speech was notably missing an apology or expression of contrition for his actions. Instead, he offered advice and focused on his own struggles, falling short of helpfulness by failing to acknowledge the harm he caused. Franken's denial of the allegations was vague and failed to meet any standards of a sincere apology. He took back previous apologies, either to preserve his reputation or insincerely, as a favour to his accusers. Franken squandered an opportunity to contribute to the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power and instead chose to prioritise his own political legacy. By sacrificing his accusers, Franken made it harder to fight injustices and encouraged voters to doubt and shame the women who came forward. Franken's actions were unfair and ironic, as he will leave the Senate while accused harassers like Roy Moore and Donald Trump remain in power. Franken's failure to take responsibility and express remorse sent a harmful message and set a negative example for those accused of sexual misconduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
