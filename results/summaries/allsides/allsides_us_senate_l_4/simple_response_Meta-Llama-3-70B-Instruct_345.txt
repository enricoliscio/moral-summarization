SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech fell short of apologizing for his sexual misconduct, instead focusing on his own struggles and offering advice on running for office. He failed to acknowledge the harm done, admit his role, express remorse, and explain how he would make amends, as outlined in sociologist David Karp's five-point checklist for helpful public apologies. Franken's statement was a "master class in what not to do" when accused of sexual misconduct. By denying some allegations and being unclear about others, Franken took back his previous apologies and encouraged voters to doubt and shame his accusers. He chose to preserve his own reputation over contributing to the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and make amends, and instead, he made it harder to fight against injustices like sexual harassment and assault.

END OF SUMMARY.
