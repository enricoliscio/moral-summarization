SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he failed to apologize, focused on his own struggles, and seemed to take back his previous apologies. His speech did not acknowledge the harm done, admit his role, express remorse, or explain how he would make amends. By doing so, he squandered a chance to contribute to the conversation around sexual harassment and instead encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers. Franken's speech was a masterclass in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct. His decision to prioritize his own reputation over taking responsibility for his actions has made it harder to fight against injustices and has harmed the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power.
