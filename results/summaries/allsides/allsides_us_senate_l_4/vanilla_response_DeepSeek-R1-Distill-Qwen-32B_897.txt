Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Al Franken's resignation speech. The user wants a concise summary of no more than 200 words, ending with specific tokens. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are that Franken resigned after multiple harassment allegations, he didn't apologize properly in his speech, and he failed to meet the criteria for a good public apology. He focused on himself and denied some allegations, which hurt the women who came forward. The article also contrasts his initial apology with his later statements, suggesting he might have been insincere or trying to save face. 

I need to make sure the summary includes all these elements: his resignation, the lack of apology, the checklist for apologies, his vague denials, and the impact on the cause of protecting women. I'll keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

I should structure the summary to first state that he resigned, mention the women's allegations, then discuss his failed apology and what he should have done. Conclude with the implications of his actions on the movement against harassment.

I'll check the word count as I draft to ensure it's under 200 words. Also, make sure to include the necessary tokens at the beginning and end.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken resigned from the Senate after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. In his resignation speech, he failed to apologize properly, instead focusing on his own struggles and denying some allegations. Sociologist David Karp outlined five steps for a meaningful apology: acknowledging harm, admitting fault, expressing remorse, committing to change, and making amends. Frankenâ€™s speech fell short, particularly on acknowledging harm, as he seemed to retract his earlier apologies. He denied some claims and offered vague responses to others, undermining the women who came forward. His speech emphasized his personal hardships and offered advice for aspiring politicians, rather than addressing the harm caused. By failing to clearly accept responsibility or commit to change, Franken hurt the cause of protecting women from harassment. His actions highlighted a missed opportunity to support the movement against sexual misconduct, instead prioritizing his political reputation.  

END OF SUMMARY.
