SUMMARY:

Senator Al Franken's resignation speech on Thursday was criticized for lacking contrition and failing to apologize for his actions. Despite multiple women accusing him of sexual harassment, Franken did not acknowledge the harm done, admit his role, or express remorse. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back previous apologies. His speech was seen as a "master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct." Franken's statement contradicted his earlier apology, where he acknowledged wrongdoing and promised to be more conscious and sensitive in the future. By denying some allegations and not clearly addressing others, Franken failed to provide a clear explanation of his actions and what he would do differently. His speech was seen as harmful to the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power and may have encouraged voters to doubt and shame his accusers.

END OF SUMMARY.
