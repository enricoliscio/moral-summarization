SUMMARY: In his resignation speech, Senator Al Franken failed to apologize or take responsibility for the sexual misconduct allegations made by multiple women. Franken's statement contradicted his earlier apologies and denied some of the allegations, taking back what little accountability he had previously offered. Instead of contributing to the change he claimed to support, Franken focused on his own struggles and gave advice on running for office. He missed an opportunity to do good and chose to preserve his reputation at the expense of his accusers, ultimately making it harder to fight injustices like these in the future. Franken's resignation highlights the unfairness of other accused men, like Roy Moore and Donald Trump, remaining in power. Franken's actions set back the progress made in listening to and believing women's experiences with men's abuses of power. 

END OF SUMMARY.
