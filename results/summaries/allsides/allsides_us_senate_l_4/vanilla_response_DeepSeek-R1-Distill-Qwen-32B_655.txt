Alright, I need to summarize this article about Al Franken's resignation speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Al Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. He had apologized before, but in his resignation speech, he didn't apologize again. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and gave advice on running for office. The article mentions a checklist for effective apologies, which Franken failed to meet. He didn't acknowledge the harm done or express remorse properly. 

There are eight women who accused him of groping or kissing them without consent. Franken denied some allegations and didn't clearly address others. The article suggests he either took back his apology to save his reputation or was insincere from the start. Either way, he didn't give the women a clear explanation or commitment to change.

Franken's speech emphasized the importance of listening to women but didn't contribute to the cause. He talked about his own tough weeks and gave advice, which made it seem like he was still a role model. By vaguely denying the allegations, he encouraged doubting the accusers, which undermines the fight against harassment.

The article ends by noting the unfairness that Franken is resigning while others like Roy Moore and Donald Trump remain in power. Franken's actions made it harder to fight these injustices.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: his resignation, the lack of apology, the checklist failure, the eight women's accusations, his vague denial, the impact on the cause, and the broader injustices.

I should structure it to highlight that Franken missed the opportunity to apologize properly, which hurt the cause he claimed to support. Also, mention the contrast with others not facing consequences.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and covers all these points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Al Franken resigned from the Senate after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, but his resignation speech failed to apologize or acknowledge the harm caused. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, offered political advice, and vaguely denied the allegations, undermining the women who came forward. Sociologist David Karp’s checklist for effective apologies—acknowledging harm, expressing remorse, and committing to change—was not met. Franken had previously apologized but later seemed to retract it, leaving accusers without a clear explanation or commitment to change. His speech emphasized the importance of listening to women but did not contribute to the cause, instead encouraging doubt toward the accusers. By prioritizing his reputation, Franken harmed the fight against sexual misconduct. The article highlights the injustice that others accused of misconduct, like Roy Moore and Donald Trump, remain in power, while Franken’s actions made it harder to address these issues. END OF SUMMARY.
