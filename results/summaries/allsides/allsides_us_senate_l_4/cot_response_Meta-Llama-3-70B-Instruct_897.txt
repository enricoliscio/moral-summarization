SUMMARY:
Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech failed to show contrition and remorse for his alleged sexual misconduct. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back his previous apologies. Franken's statement lacked a clear acknowledgment of harm, admission of guilt, and expression of remorse, making it a "master class in what not to do" when accused of sexual misconduct. By denying some allegations and downplaying others, Franken encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers, ultimately harming the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. His speech was a missed opportunity to contribute to real change and instead made it harder to fight injustices. END OF SUMMARY.
