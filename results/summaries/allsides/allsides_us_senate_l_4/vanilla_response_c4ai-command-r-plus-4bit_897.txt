SUMMARY: In his resignation speech, Senator Al Franken failed to apologize or take responsibility for the sexual misconduct allegations made by multiple women. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and gave advice on running for office. Franken's speech contradicted his previous apologies and denied some of the allegations, falling short of the standards for a helpful public apology. He missed an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation about sexual harassment and men's abuses of power, choosing to preserve his reputation over supporting his accusers. Franken's actions set a negative example and made it more difficult to fight injustices, such as the cases of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who remain in power despite facing similar allegations. 

END OF SUMMARY.
