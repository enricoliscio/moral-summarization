SUMMARY:
Senator Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he failed to apologize and shifted the focus to his own struggles, taking back his previous apologies and implying that some of the allegations against him were false. This masterclass in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct undermined the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's speech was insincere, and he prioritized preserving his reputation over making amends with his accusers. By doing so, he encouraged voters to doubt and shame the women who came forward, perpetuating the unfair and unjust treatment of those who report harassment. Franken's actions made it harder to fight against the injustices of sexual misconduct, and his resignation speech was a lost opportunity to contribute to real change. END OF SUMMARY.
