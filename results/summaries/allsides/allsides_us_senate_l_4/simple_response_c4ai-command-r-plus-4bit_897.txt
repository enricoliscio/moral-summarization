SUMMARY: In his resignation speech, Senator Al Franken missed an opportunity to show contrition for his sexual misconduct and contribute to the broader conversation around harassment and men's abuses of power. Instead, he squandered a chance to do good and offered a master class in what not to do when accused of such behavior. Franken's speech failed to meet the criteria for a helpful public apology, as he did not specifically acknowledge the harm done, admit his role in it, or express remorse. He denied some of the allegations and seemed to take back his previous apologies, focusing on his own struggles and offering vague denials. Franken's choice to prioritize his reputation over helping to protect women from men's abuses of power was a missed opportunity to do the right thing and make amends. By sacrificing his accusers for his political legacy, he made it harder to fight injustices and encouraged doubt and shame toward those who came forward. Franken's resignation highlights the unfairness of the situation, as accused harassers like Roy Moore and Donald Trump remain in power, but his actions only serve to perpetuate the challenges faced by survivors of sexual misconduct.
END OF SUMMARY.
