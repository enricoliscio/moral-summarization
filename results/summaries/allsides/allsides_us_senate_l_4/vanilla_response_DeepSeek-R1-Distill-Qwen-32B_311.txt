Alright, I need to summarize this article about Al Franken's resignation speech. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the main points without getting too detailed. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key events. Sen. Franken resigned after multiple harassment allegations. His speech was supposed to be an opportunity to apologize and show contrition, but he didn't do that. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and denied some allegations, which didn't help the women who came forward.

I should highlight that he missed the chance to properly apologize, as per the five-point checklist mentioned. Also, his vague denials could make people doubt the accusers. It's important to note that he chose to protect his reputation over supporting the cause of protecting women.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll structure it by mentioning the resignation, the missed opportunity, his vague statements, the checklist failure, and the consequences of his actions. Ending with the injustices he pointed out ties it back to the broader issues.

I'll make sure the summary is clear and sticks to the main points without unnecessary details. Let me put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, but his speech failed to provide a meaningful apology or acknowledge the harm caused. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, denied some allegations, and offered vague statements, which undermined the women who came forward. Sociologist David Karp outlined five steps for a proper apology, including acknowledging harm and expressing remorse, which Franken did not fulfill. Franken initially apologized but later seemed to backtrack, leaving his accusers without a clear explanation or commitment to change. His speech also downplayed the broader issue of sexual harassment, giving ammunition to those who doubt accusers. By prioritizing his reputation over accountability, Franken hindered efforts to protect women from harassment. His resignation highlighted ongoing injustices, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump facing little consequence for similar allegations. END OF SUMMARY.
