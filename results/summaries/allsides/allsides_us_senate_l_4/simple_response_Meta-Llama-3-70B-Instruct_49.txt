SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech fell short of apologizing for his sexual misconduct, instead focusing on his own struggles and offering advice on running for office. He failed to acknowledge the harm he caused, express remorse, or explain how he would make amends, contradicting his earlier apology. Franken's statement was a "master class in what not to do" when accused of sexual misconduct. By denying some allegations and being unclear about others, he took back his earlier apology and encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers. Franken had a choice to either help the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power or preserve his own reputation, and he chose the latter. His speech made it harder to fight injustices, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump remaining in power despite similar allegations. Franken's failure to take responsibility for his actions undermined the progress made in the conversation around sexual harassment.

END OF SUMMARY.
