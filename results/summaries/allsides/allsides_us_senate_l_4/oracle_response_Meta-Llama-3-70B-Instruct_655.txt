SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and apologize for his sexual misconduct. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, took back his previous apologies, and offered vague denials of the allegations against him. By doing so, he squandered a chance to do good and harmed the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's speech was a master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct, failing to acknowledge the harm done, admit his role, express remorse, or explain how he would make amends. He even offered advice on running for office, as if he were still a role model, and encouraged voters to doubt and shame his accusers. By preserving his own reputation, Franken made it harder to fight the injustices of sexual harassment and assault. He chose to harm the cause he claims to care about, rather than help it. Franken's speech was a morally bankrupt attempt to save his own skin, and it will only serve to perpetuate the harmful attitudes towards women who report harassment. END OF SUMMARY.
