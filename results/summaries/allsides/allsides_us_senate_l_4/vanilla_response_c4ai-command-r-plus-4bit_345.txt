SUMMARY: In his resignation speech, Senator Al Franken missed an opportunity to show contrition for his alleged sexual misconduct and instead offered a master class in what not to do when accused of such behavior. Franken failed to apologize or express remorse, instead focusing on his own struggles and giving vague denials of the reports by his accusers. This encouraged voters to doubt and shame the women who came forward, and it harmed the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's speech squandered a chance to contribute to meaningful change and, by taking back his earlier apologies, he sacrificed his accusers for the benefit of his political legacy. Franken's resignation highlights the unfairness of other accused men, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump, remaining in power. However, by going back on his apologies, Franken made it harder to fight these injustices.

END OF SUMMARY.
