SUMMARY:
Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech following sexual misconduct allegations lacked contrition and failed to acknowledge the harm he caused to his accusers. Franken's statement did not meet the standards of a helpful public apology, as he focused on his own struggles instead of expressing remorse and taking responsibility for his actions. He denied some allegations and was vague about others, falling short of providing a clear explanation and taking back his previous apologies. Franken missed an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation on sexual harassment and protecting women from men's abuses of power. Instead, he chose to preserve his political legacy at the cost of harming his accusers, encouraging voters to doubt and shame them. Franken's actions were morally questionable, sacrificing his accusers for his political legacy and making it harder to fight injustices against women.
END OF SUMMARY.
