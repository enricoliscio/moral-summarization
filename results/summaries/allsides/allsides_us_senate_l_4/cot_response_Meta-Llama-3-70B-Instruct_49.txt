SUMMARY:
Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and remorse for his alleged sexual misconduct. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back his previous apologies. He failed to acknowledge the harm he had caused, admit his role in it, and express remorse. By doing so, he essentially took his accusers down with him and made it harder to fight against sexual harassment and abuse of power. Franken's speech was a master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct. He prioritized preserving his own reputation over contributing to the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. His actions were unfair and unjust, making it harder to fight against the likes of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who have also been accused of sexual misconduct. END OF SUMMARY.
