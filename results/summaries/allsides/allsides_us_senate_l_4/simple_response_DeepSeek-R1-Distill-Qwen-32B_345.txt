Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Al Franken's resignation speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about how Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. He had apologized before but in his resignation speech, he didn't apologize again. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back his previous apologies. The author is critical of this, saying he missed an opportunity to show contrition and instead gave bad advice on how to handle such accusations.

I should make sure to include the key points: the accusations, his previous apologies, the content of his resignation speech, the checklist for a good apology (acknowledge harm, admit role, express remorse, etc.), how Franken failed this checklist, the impact on his accusers, and the broader implications about justice and fighting harassment.

I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral tone. Maybe start by stating that Franken failed to apologize properly, then explain what he did instead, and the consequences. Also, mention the broader injustices he pointed out but how his actions made it harder to fight them.

Let me structure it: Introduction about the resignation and accusations, his failure to apologize, the checklist, his vague denial, the harm to his accusers, and the broader context. Conclude with how his actions set a bad precedent.

I should avoid being too verbose and stick to the main points. Make sure each sentence adds value and flows logically. Also, use concise language to stay within the word limit.

Okay, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it captures all these elements while preserving the moral critique.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken failed to apologize properly during his resignation speech after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. Instead of acknowledging harm, expressing remorse, or committing to change, Franken focused on his own struggles and seemed to retract his earlier apologies. His vague denial of the allegations and advice on running for office sent the wrong message, undermining the women who came forward and reinforcing harmful stereotypes about accusers. By prioritizing his reputation over accountability, Franken missed an opportunity to support the cause of protecting women from harassment. His actions set a poor example and made it harder to address broader injustices, such as the continued presence of accused harassers in positions of power. END OF SUMMARY.
