SUMMARY:

Senator Al Franken's resignation speech fell short of apologizing for his alleged sexual misconduct, instead focusing on his own struggles and offering advice on running for office. Franken's statement failed to acknowledge the harm done to the women who accused him, admit his role in it, express remorse, explain which behaviors he'll stop, and share his plan for making amends. This was a missed opportunity to show contrition and contribute to the conversation around sexual harassment. Franken's speech was criticized for taking back his earlier apologies, encouraging voters to doubt his accusers, and harming the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. By prioritizing his own reputation over accountability, Franken made it harder to fight against injustices like Roy Moore's potential entry into the Senate and Donald Trump's presidency despite allegations of sexual misconduct.

END OF SUMMARY.
