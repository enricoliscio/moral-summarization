SUMMARY: In his resignation speech, Senator Al Franken failed to apologize or take responsibility for the sexual misconduct allegations made by multiple women. Franken's statement contradicted his earlier apologies and denied some of the allegations, prioritizing his reputation over the women's experiences. He missed an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation about sexual harassment and men's abuses of power. Franken's speech instead focused on his own struggles and offered advice on running for office. By not acknowledging the harm done and expressing remorse, Franken fell short of the standards for a helpful public apology and harmed the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's decision to resign in this manner made it harder to fight injustices and hold other accused men in power accountable. 

END OF SUMMARY.
