SUMMARY:

Senator Al Franken's resignation speech was criticized for lacking contrition and failing to acknowledge the harm caused to the women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Instead of apologizing, Franken focused on his own struggles, gave advice on running for office, and seemed to take back previous apologies. His speech did not meet the criteria for a helpful public apology, as outlined by sociologist David Karp. Franken's statement was inconsistent with his previous apology, where he expressed remorse for his actions. By denying some allegations and not clearly addressing others, Franken failed to provide the women who came forward with a clear explanation of what he believed he did wrong and how he would change. His speech ultimately harmed the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power and made it harder to fight against injustices.

END OF SUMMARY.
