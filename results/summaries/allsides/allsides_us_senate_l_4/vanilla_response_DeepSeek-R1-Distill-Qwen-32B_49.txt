Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Al Franken's resignation speech. The user provided the article, and they want a concise summary of around 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Al Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. He had previously apologized but in his resignation speech, he didn't apologize again. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back his earlier apologies. The article mentions a checklist for a good public apology, which Franken failed to meet. He didn't acknowledge the harm done or express remorse clearly. Instead, he denied some allegations and cast doubt on the accusers, which could harm the cause of supporting survivors.

I should highlight that Franken's speech missed the opportunity to show contrition and instead undermined the women who came forward. Also, the article points out the broader issues with how society handles these cases, like Roy Moore and Donald Trump, but Franken's actions made it harder to address these injustices.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary. I'll start by stating that Franken resigned after harassment allegations. Then mention his failed opportunity to apologize properly. I'll include his vague denials and how it affected the survivors. Finally, touch on the broader societal issues he referenced but didn't address.

I should make sure the summary is clear and within the word limit. Let me structure it step by step to cover all key points without going over 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken resigned from the Senate after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, but his resignation speech failed to apologize or acknowledge the harm caused. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, denied some allegations, and seemed to retract his earlier apologies. Sociologist David Karp outlined five steps for a proper apology, which Franken did not follow. His vague denial of the accusations and focus on his own feelings undermined the women who came forward and risked public shaming. Franken could have used the moment to support the cause of protecting women from harassment but instead chose to preserve his reputation, harming the cause. The article highlights the broader injustice of men like Roy Moore and Donald Trump facing little consequence, but Frankenâ€™s actions made it harder to address these issues. His resignation, while acknowledging the unfairness of similar cases, ultimately discredited his accusers and weakened efforts to combat sexual misconduct.  
END OF SUMMARY.
