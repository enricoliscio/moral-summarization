Okay, I need to summarize this article about Al Franken's speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. So, I should focus on the key points where Franken failed to apologize properly and how that affected the women who accused him.

First, the article mentions that Franken resigned after multiple accusations of sexual harassment. He had apologized before but didn't take the opportunity to show contrition in his resignation speech. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and didn't clearly apologize, which the author criticizes.

I should include the checklist for a good apology from David Karp: acknowledging harm, admitting his role, expressing remorse, stopping the behavior, and making amends. Franken failed the first step by not clearly admitting his actions.

The article also points out that Franken denied some allegations and didn't address others, which could mean he was trying to save his reputation. This left the accusers without a clear explanation or commitment to change, which is what they deserved.

Franken talked about the importance of listening to women but didn't contribute to that change himself. He focused on his feelings and gave advice as if he were still a role model. He encouraged doubting the accusers, which supports harmful narratives against women.

The author argues that Franken chose to protect his reputation over supporting the cause of protecting women. This made it harder to fight against injustices like those involving Roy Moore and Donald Trump.

So, the summary should highlight Franken's missed opportunity to apologize properly, the checklist he failed, his vague denials, and the negative impact on the accusers and the movement against harassment.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral criticism. I'll structure it by mentioning his resignation, his failure to apologize, the checklist, his vague denials, the impact on the women, and the broader implications.

SUMMARY: Al Franken's resignation speech after multiple sexual harassment allegations failed to address the moral obligation to apologize and take responsibility. Instead of acknowledging harm, expressing remorse, and committing to change—key elements of a meaningful apology—Franken focused on his own struggles and vague denials. He downplayed the accusations, suggesting some were "not true" or "remembered differently," while retracting his earlier apologies. This approach disrespected the women who came forward and undermined the broader movement against harassment. By prioritizing his reputation over accountability, Franken missed an opportunity to contribute to meaningful change and instead fueled skepticism toward accusers. His actions highlight the challenges of holding powerful men accountable and the ongoing struggle for justice in cases like those involving Roy Moore and Donald Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
