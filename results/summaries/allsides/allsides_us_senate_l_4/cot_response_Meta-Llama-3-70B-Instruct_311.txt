SUMMARY:
Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech fell short of expectations, lacking a genuine apology for his sexual misconduct. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, took back his previous apologies, and seemed to doubt the accounts of his accusers. This was a missed opportunity to show contrition and contribute to the conversation around sexual harassment. Franken's speech was a "master class in what not to do" when accused of sexual misconduct. By not acknowledging the harm done and expressing remorse, he failed to meet the basic requirements of a helpful public apology. His vague denial of the reports also encouraged voters to doubt and shame his accusers, ultimately harming the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's decision to prioritize his own reputation over doing good was a morally regrettable choice. END OF SUMMARY.
