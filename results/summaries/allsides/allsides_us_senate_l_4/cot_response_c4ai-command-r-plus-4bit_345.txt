SUMMARY: Al Franken's resignation speech was notably devoid of any expression of contrition or remorse for his actions. Instead of taking responsibility and apologizing to the women he harmed, Franken chose to focus on his own struggles and sacrifices. He denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, taking back his previous apologies and casting doubt on his accusers. Franken's speech was a missed opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation around men's abuses of power and to offer a clear explanation of his wrongdoing and commitment to change. Instead, he chose to preserve his political legacy at the cost of harming the cause of protecting women from such abuses. Franken's decision to sacrifice his accusers for his own political gain makes it harder to fight injustices and sends a harmful message that encourages shaming and doubt towards women who speak out. Franken's resignation highlights the unfairness of other accused men, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump, remaining in power despite credible allegations, and underscores the ongoing struggle for justice and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
