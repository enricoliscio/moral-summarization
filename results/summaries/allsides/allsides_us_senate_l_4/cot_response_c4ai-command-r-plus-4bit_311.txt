SUMMARY:
Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech failed to show contrition and instead offered a master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct. Franken's statement lacked a clear acknowledgment of the harm done, a crucial first step in a helpful public apology. He denied some allegations and seemed to take back previous apologies, focusing on his own struggles and giving vague denials. Franken squandered an opportunity to contribute to change by expressing remorse and explaining what he would do differently. Instead, he encouraged voters to doubt his accusers, sacrificing them for his political legacy. Franken's resignation is unfair compared to accused men like Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who remain in power. By denying his actions and failing to apologize sincerely, Franken made it harder to fight injustices and protect women from men's abuses of power. Franken's speech was a missed chance to do good, ultimately harming the cause he claims to care about.
END OF SUMMARY.
