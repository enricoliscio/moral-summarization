Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a detailed news article about Al Franken's resignation speech and the moral implications of his actions. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the author's moral framing.

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's about Sen. Al Franken resigning after multiple sexual harassment allegations. The article criticizes his speech for not apologizing properly and instead focusing on himself and denying some allegations. The author uses a checklist for a good apology and shows how Franken failed each step. There's also a moral judgment that Franken's actions hurt the cause of supporting survivors and contributed to a broader issue of injustice towards women.

I should make sure the summary includes all these elements. I need to highlight that Franken missed an opportunity to apologize properly, the checklist, his vague denials, and the negative impact on the movement against sexual harassment. I also need to mention the contrast with other figures like Roy Moore and Donald Trump to show the broader injustice.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it captures the moral framing—emphasizing the missed opportunity, the checklist, the denial, and the negative consequences. I'll structure it to first state the main event, then critique the speech, mention the checklist failure, discuss the denial and its impact, and conclude with the broader implications.

I need to avoid any markdown and just provide the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll ensure the language is clear and the moral points are clearly articulated.

SUMMARY: Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, but his resignation speech failed to properly apologize or acknowledge the harm caused. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, denied some allegations, and offered vague denials, undermining the women who came forward. The author highlights a checklist for effective apologies: acknowledging harm, admitting fault, expressing remorse, committing to change, and making amends. Franken failed all these steps, choosing to protect his reputation over supporting survivors. His vague denial and focus on himself encouraged doubting the accusers, harming the cause of combating sexual misconduct. By not clearly apologizing or taking responsibility, Franken sacrificed the credibility of his accusers for his political legacy. The article criticizes this choice, noting the broader injustice of men like Roy Moore and Donald Trump facing fewer consequences, while Franken’s actions made it harder to fight such injustices. END OF SUMMARY.
