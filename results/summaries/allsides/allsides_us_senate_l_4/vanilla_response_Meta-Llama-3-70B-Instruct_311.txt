SUMMARY:

Senator Al Franken's resignation speech was criticized for lacking contrition and apology to the multiple women who accused him of sexual harassment. Instead of taking responsibility, Franken focused on his own struggles, offered advice on running for office, and seemed to take back his previous apologies. He failed to acknowledge the harm done, admit his role, express remorse, explain which behaviors he'll stop, and share his plan for making amends. Franken's statement contrasted with his earlier apology, where he expressed remorse and promised to be more conscious and sensitive. By not providing a clear explanation of what he did wrong and what he's committed to changing, Franken failed to contribute to the conversation around sexual harassment and instead encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers. His speech was seen as a missed opportunity to do good and instead offered a master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct.

END OF SUMMARY.
