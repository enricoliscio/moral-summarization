SUMMARY:
Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech fell short of apologizing for his sexual misconduct, instead focusing on his own struggles and offering advice on running for office. He failed to acknowledge the harm done to the women who accused him, and his vague denial of the reports encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers. This was a missed opportunity to show contrition and contribute to the conversation around sexual harassment. Franken's speech was a "master class in what not to do" when accused of sexual misconduct. By taking back his earlier apologies, he prioritized preserving his reputation over doing good and fighting for a cause he claims to care about - protecting women from men's abuses of power. His actions made it harder to fight against injustices, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump remaining in power despite similar accusations. END OF SUMMARY.
