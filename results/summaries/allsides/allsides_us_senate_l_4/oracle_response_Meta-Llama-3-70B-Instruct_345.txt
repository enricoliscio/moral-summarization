SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, offered advice on running for office, and seemed to take back his previous apologies. Franken's statement failed to acknowledge the harm done, admit his role in it, express remorse, and explain how he would make amends. He denied some allegations and responded unclearly to others, leaving the women who accused him without a clear explanation of what he did wrong and how he would change. By doing so, Franken encouraged voters to doubt and shame his accusers, harming the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. He chose to preserve his own reputation at the cost of harming the women who came forward. Franken's actions made it harder to fight the injustices of sexual misconduct, harassment, and assault.
