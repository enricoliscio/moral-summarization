Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Al Franken's resignation speech while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words to include, so I should make sure those are present in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Franken resigned after multiple accusations of groping and harassment. His speech didn't apologize properly, which was a missed opportunity. The author contrasts his initial sincere apology with his later vague denial, which undermines the accusers.

I need to highlight the moral issues: he failed to apologize adequately, squandered an opportunity, and instead focused on himself. Using words like "groped," "harassed," "squandered," "apologize," and "misconduct" is important.

I should structure the summary to show how Franken's actions affected the cause of protecting women. His vague denial gave ammunition to those doubting the accusers, making it harder to fight injustices.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced. The tone should reflect the author's disapproval of Franken's handling of the situation.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken’s resignation speech, following multiple accusations of groping and harassment, was widely criticized for failing to properly apologize or address the harm caused. Instead of showing contrition, Franken focused on his own struggles, offered vague denials of the allegations, and squandered an opportunity to contribute to the fight against sexual misconduct. His initial apology, where he acknowledged disrespect and promised change, was undermined by his later statements, which seemed to backtrack and cast doubt on the accusers. By doing so, Franken provided ammunition to those who dismiss women’s accounts, harming the cause of protecting women from men’s abuses of power. His speech, which could have been a moment of accountability, instead prioritized his own reputation over the women who came forward. The author highlights the injustice of Franken’s actions, as he chose to preserve his legacy at the cost of his accusers, making it harder to address broader injustices like those involving Roy Moore and Donald Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
