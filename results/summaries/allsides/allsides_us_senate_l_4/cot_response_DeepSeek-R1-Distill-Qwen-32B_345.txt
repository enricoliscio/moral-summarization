Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. It's about Al Franken resigning after multiple accusations of sexual harassment. The author is critical of Franken's speech, pointing out that he didn't apologize properly and instead focused on himself and his political advice.

The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed. Then, write a summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral weight. Words like "missing," "groped," "sexually harassed," "apologized," "contrition," "opportunity," "squandered," "master class," "sexual misconduct," "acknowledge," "harm," "admit," "remorse," "stop," "amends," "respectful," "abuses," "impression," "admitting," "false," "harassment," "abuses," "sincere," "reputation," "insincere," "favor," "save," "clear explanation," "owe," "sincere," "previous apology," "contradict," "vague denial," "doubt," "shame," "ammunition," "right-wing plot," "vindictive," "harpies," "harm," "protecting," "abuses," "reputation," "injustices," "fought," "sacrificed," "legacy," "harmer," "opportunity," "change," "fairness," "irony," "unfair," "injustices," "fought," "harder," "easy," "fight."

Now, for the summary. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of these moral words as possible. I should structure it to highlight Franken's failure to apologize properly, the impact on the accusers, and the broader implications of his actions.

I'll start by mentioning the resignation and the lack of proper apology. Then, touch on the checklist for apologies and how Franken didn't meet those. Highlight the vague denial and the encouragement of doubting the accusers. Conclude with the broader injustices and how Franken's actions made it harder to fight them.

I should ensure the summary flows well and maintains the moral judgment present in the original article. Also, make sure to keep it within the word limit. Let me draft that.

**SUMMARY:**  
Al Franken’s resignation speech after multiple accusations of groping and sexual harassment was widely criticized for lacking contrition. Instead of apologizing and acknowledging the harm caused, Franken focused on his own struggles and offered vague denials, squandering an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation on protecting women from men’s abuses of power. His speech failed to meet the criteria for a sincere public apology, such as expressing remorse and explaining how he would change his behavior. By contradicting his earlier apology and encouraging doubt about his accusers, Franken harmed the cause he claimed to support and sacrificed his accusers for his political legacy. His actions made it harder to fight injustices like those faced by Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who remain in power despite similar accusations. Franken’s failure to take responsibility and show genuine remorse highlights the challenges of accountability in addressing sexual misconduct. END OF SUMMARY.
