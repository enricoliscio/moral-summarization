Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. I'll start by reading the article to understand the main points. 

The article is about Al Franken's resignation speech after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. He didn't apologize properly, which the author criticizes. I need to highlight his failure to take responsibility and the negative impact on the women who came forward.

I should make sure to include words like "groped," "harassed," "apologize," "squandered," "misconduct," "harm," "abuses," "disrespectful," "kissed," "grabbed," "insincere," "deny," "encouraged," "shame," "ammunition," "protecting," "sacrificing," and "unfair."

I'll structure the summary to show how Franken's actions affected the cause of protecting women and how his speech backtracked on his previous apology, harming the accusers. I'll keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally while including as many moral terms as possible.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken’s resignation speech after being accused of groping and harassing women was criticized for failing to apologize properly. Instead of acknowledging the harm and expressing remorse, Franken focused on his own struggles, squandered an opportunity to contribute to the fight against sexual misconduct, and offered vague denials of the allegations. His speech, which denied some accusations and downplayed others, discouraged the women who came forward and provided ammunition to those who doubt their credibility. By retracting his earlier apology, Franken harmed the cause of protecting women from men’s abuses of power and prioritized his political legacy over accountability. His actions made it harder to address injustices like those faced by Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who remain in power despite similar accusations. Franken’s speech not only failed to take responsibility but also sacrificed his accusers, making it more difficult to fight for justice. END OF SUMMARY.
