Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. Let me read through the article again to spot these words. 

The article talks about Al Franken's resignation and his failure to properly apologize. Words like "missing," "apologized," "contrition," "risked," "shaming," "opportunity," "good," "master class," "sexual misconduct," "acknowledge," "harm," "admit," "remorse," "stop," "amends," "respectful," "harassment," "abuses," "impression," "false," "admitting," "simply," "deny," "clearly," "reputation," "insincere," "favor," "save," "deserve," "explanation," "wrong," "changing," "sincere," "tough," "advice," "role model," "long hours," "late nights," "hard lessons," "guarantee," "work," "sacrifice," "pay off," "vague denial," "doubt," "shame," "ammunition," "right-wing plot," "harassment," "vindictive," "harpies," "harm," "protecting," "abuses," "political legacy," "injustices," "fought," "sacrificed," "harder," "easier," "fight."

Now, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without exceeding 200 words. The summary should highlight Franken's failure to apologize properly, the moral implications of his actions, and the impact on the women who accused him. I'll make sure to include the key points: his resignation, the lack of a proper apology, the checklist for apologies, his vague denial, and the consequences of his actions on the movement against sexual misconduct.

**SUMMARY:**  
Al Franken failed to show contrition during his resignation speech, squandering an opportunity to address the sexual misconduct allegations against him. Instead of apologizing, he focused on his own struggles and vaguely denied the accusations, undermining the women who came forward. Sociologist David Karp’s checklist for a proper apology—acknowledging harm, admitting fault, expressing remorse, and committing to change—was not met. Franken’s vague denial encouraged doubt and shame toward his accusers, harming the cause of protecting women from harassment. By prioritizing his political legacy over accountability, Franken made it harder to fight injustices like Roy Moore’s and Donald Trump’s unchecked behavior. His actions sacrificed his accusers and set a poor example for addressing sexual misconduct.
