Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Al Franken's resignation speech. The user provided the article, and they want a concise summary, no longer than 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Al Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. He had apologized before but in his resignation speech, he didn't apologize again. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back his previous apologies. The article mentions a checklist for a good apology: acknowledge harm, admit role, express remorse, explain future changes, and share plans to make amends. Franken failed all these, especially the first step. He denied some allegations and said others were different from his memory. 

The article also contrasts his earlier sincere apology with his later vague denials. It suggests he either took back his apology to save his reputation or was insincere from the start. Either way, he didn't give the women a clear explanation or commitment to change. He talked about the broader conversation on harassment but didn't use his speech to contribute positively. Instead, he focused on his own feelings and gave advice as if still a role model. By denying the allegations vaguely, he encouraged doubting the accusers, harming the cause he claimed to support.

The article ends by noting the injustice that others accused of misconduct remain in power while Franken resigns, but Franken's actions made it harder to fight these injustices.

So, the summary needs to capture all these points concisely. I'll start by stating Franken resigned after harassment allegations, mention his failed opportunity to apologize properly, contrast his vague denials with earlier apologies, and the impact on the cause of protecting women. Also, touch on the broader injustice but note Franken's choice to prioritize his reputation over the cause.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be brief but cover all main points. Make sure to include the checklist failure, the contrast between his apologies, the denial of allegations, and the negative impact on the movement against harassment.

SUMMARY:  
Al Franken resigned from the Senate after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, but his resignation speech failed to apologize or acknowledge the harm caused. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, denied some allegations, and seemed to retract his earlier apologies. Sociologist David Karp outlined five steps for a meaningful apology: acknowledging harm, admitting fault, expressing remorse, committing to change, and making amends. Franken failed all these steps, particularly by denying or downplaying the allegations. His vague denials and focus on himself discouraged accountability and harmed the cause of addressing sexual misconduct. By prioritizing his reputation over the women who came forward, Franken weakened efforts to combat harassment and misconduct in power. His resignation highlights ongoing injustices, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump remaining in power despite similar accusations, but Frankenâ€™s actions made it harder to address these issues.  
END OF SUMMARY.
