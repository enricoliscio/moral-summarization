SUMMARY: Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) resigned after being accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, but his speech was notably lacking in contrition or apology. Franken failed to acknowledge the harm he had caused, taking back previous apologies and denying some of the allegations. This was a missed opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation around sexual harassment and to offer a clear explanation of his actions and a plan for change. Instead, Franken focused on his own struggles and feelings, gave advice on running for office, and encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers. Franken's choice to prioritize his own reputation over the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power was a moral failure that made it harder to fight injustices and harmed the women who came forward.

END OF SUMMARY.
