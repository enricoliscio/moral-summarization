Okay, I need to summarize this article about Al Franken's resignation speech while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about how Franken resigned after multiple women accused him of groping and harassment. He had apologized before but in his resignation speech, he didn't apologize again. Instead, he focused on his own struggles and seemed to take back his previous apologies. The author uses terms like "squandered," "misconduct," and "harmed" to highlight Franken's failure to address the issue properly.

I should include words like "groped," "harassed," "apologize," "squandered," "misconduct," "harm," etc. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and capture the moral failure aspect. I'll structure it to mention the accusations, his lack of apology, the checklist for a good apology, and the consequences of his actions. Also, note that he chose to preserve his reputation over helping the cause of protecting women.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include as many of the specified words as possible without making it too wordy. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY: Al Franken resigned from the Senate after multiple women accused him of groping and harassment. Despite an earlier apology, his resignation speech failed to acknowledge the harm caused, squandering an opportunity to address the misconduct. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, denied some allegations, and seemed to retract his previous apologies. Sociologist David Karp’s checklist for a meaningful apology—acknowledging harm, admitting fault, expressing remorse, committing to change, and making amends—was not met. Franken’s vague denial of accusers’ claims encouraged doubt and shame, harming the cause of protecting women from abuse. By prioritizing his reputation over accountability, Franken sacrificed his accusers and set a poor example for addressing sexual misconduct. His actions made it harder to fight injustices like those faced by Roy Moore and Donald Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
