SUMMARY: In his resignation speech, Senator Al Franken missed an opportunity to show contrition for his sexual misconduct and contribute to the broader conversation around harassment and men's abuses of power. Instead, he squandered a chance to do good and offered a master class in what not to do when accused of such behavior. Franken's statement failed to meet the basic criteria for a helpful public apology, as he did not specifically acknowledge the harm done, admit his role in it, or express remorse. He even seemed to take back his previous apologies, denying some allegations and offering vague responses to others. Franken focused on his own struggles and feelings, gave advice on running for office, and ultimately chose to preserve his political legacy at the cost of harming the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. By sacrificing his accusers, Franken made it harder to fight the injustices of other powerful men accused of misconduct, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who remain in their positions. Franken's resignation and speech fell short of what was needed and expected from him, both morally and ethically.
END OF SUMMARY.
