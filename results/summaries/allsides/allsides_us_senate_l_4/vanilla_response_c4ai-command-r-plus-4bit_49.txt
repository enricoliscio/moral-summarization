SUMMARY: Senator Al Franken announced his resignation following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. In his speech, Franken failed to apologize or acknowledge the harm done, instead focusing on his own struggles and giving vague denials of the reports by his accusers. This was in contrast to his previous apology, in which he had expressed remorse and committed to changing his behavior. Franken's speech squandered an opportunity to contribute to the broader conversation around sexual harassment and instead encouraged doubt and shame towards his accusers. He chose to preserve his own reputation at the cost of harming the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. Franken's resignation highlights the unfairness of other accused men, such as Roy Moore and Donald Trump, remaining in power despite allegations. However, by sacrificing his accusers, Franken made it harder to fight these injustices.

END OF SUMMARY.
