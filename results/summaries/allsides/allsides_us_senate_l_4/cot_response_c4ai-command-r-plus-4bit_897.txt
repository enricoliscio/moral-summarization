SUMMARY:
Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech following sexual misconduct allegations was notably missing an apology. Instead of showing contrition, Franken gave advice and focused on his own struggles rather than those of survivors. His speech was a stark contrast to helpful public apologies, which should specifically acknowledge harm, admit one's role, express remorse, and explain future behavioral changes. Franken's statement failed to acknowledge the harm done and gave a false impression of his actions. In his previous apology, Franken had admitted to disrespectful behavior and promised to be more careful, but he took it back in his resignation speech. He sacrificed his legacy and his accusers by prioritizing his own reputation, making it harder to fight injustices. Franken's denial of misconduct allegations and lack of remorse encourage victim-shaming and doubt, hindering progress in the fight against men's abuses of power. Franken's speech squandered an opportunity to contribute to positive change and protect women from harm.
END OF SUMMARY.
