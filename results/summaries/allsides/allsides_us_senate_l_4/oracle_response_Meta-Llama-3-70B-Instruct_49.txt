SUMMARY:

Al Franken's resignation speech fell short of apologizing for his sexual misconduct, instead focusing on his own struggles and offering advice on running for office. He failed to acknowledge the harm he caused, admit his role in it, express remorse, or explain how he would make amends. Franken's statement contrasted with his earlier apology, where he said he was "tremendously sorry" for his actions. However, in his resignation speech, he took back his apology, implying that some allegations were false and that he was respectful of the broader conversation around harassment. Franken's actions were insincere, and he prioritized preserving his reputation over helping the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. By denying the reports of his accusers, he encouraged voters to doubt and shame them. Franken's speech was a master class in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct, and he ultimately chose to harm the cause he claimed to care about. END OF SUMMARY.
