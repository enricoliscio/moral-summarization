SUMMARY: 

Al Franken's resignation speech was a missed opportunity to show contrition and apologize sincerely to the women who accused him of sexual harassment. Instead, he focused on his own struggles, took back his previous apologies, and offered vague denials of the allegations. This masterclass in what not to do when accused of sexual misconduct failed to acknowledge the harm done, admit his role, express remorse, or explain how he would make amends. Franken's speech was a stark contrast to his previous apology, where he acknowledged wrongdoing and expressed remorse. By going back on his words, Franken chose to preserve his reputation over doing good and supporting the cause of protecting women from men's abuses of power. His speech essentially took down his accusers and made it harder to fight against injustices like Roy Moore and Donald Trump remaining in power despite similar allegations. Franken's resignation speech was a moral failure.

END OF SUMMARY.
