SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen, former personal attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee with explosive allegations against his former boss. In his prepared opening statement, Cohen claims that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone in July 2016, where Stone told Trump that he had just spoken with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and that there would be a "massive dump of emails" that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which are attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also alleges that Trump was aware of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, encouraged him to make misleading claims about the project, and made racist remarks in private. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen's credibility may be challenged due to his past lies to Congress, his testimony promises to be explosive and potentially damning for Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
