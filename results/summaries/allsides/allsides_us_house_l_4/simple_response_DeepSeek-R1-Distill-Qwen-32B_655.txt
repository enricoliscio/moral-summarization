Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Michael Cohen's testimony and the claims he makes against Trump. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, ending with specific tokens. I should focus on key points: Cohen's explosive claims, the connection between Trump and WikiLeaks via Roger Stone, the lack of direct evidence but the implications, and Cohen's credibility issues. I also need to mention other claims like the Trump Tower in Moscow, the Stormy Daniels payment, and Trump's potential racist remarks. I should ensure the summary is neutral but highlights the moral implications without taking sides. Let me structure this clearly, making sure each main point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former Trump attorney, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, revealing explosive claims about Trump's alleged awareness of WikiLeaks' plans during the 2016 campaign. Cohen claims he overheard Trump discussing WikiLeaks with Roger Stone, who allegedly told Trump that Julian Assange planned to release damaging emails targeting Hillary Clinton. Cohen emphasizes he lacks direct evidence of collusion but expresses suspicions. He also alleges Trump encouraged misleading statements about the Trump Tower in Moscow, and claims Trump Jr. discussed a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen, who has admitted to lying to Congress, plans to present a check Trump signed to pay Stormy Daniels. His testimony raises questions about Trump's potential knowledge of WikiLeaks' activities, though his credibility is challenged. END OF SUMMARY.
