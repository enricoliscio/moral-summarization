Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally charged words as possible, like "hacked," "theft," "crimes," "fraud," "violations," "lying," "colluded," and "damage." 

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. Michael Cohen is testifying and making several explosive claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans, which were hacked by Russian intelligence. Cohen mentions hearing Trump and Stone discuss WikiLeaks, which ties into the idea of collusion. There's also the issue of Cohen lying to Congress, financial crimes, and the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral terms without adding any extra information. I'll structure it to highlight Cohen's claims, the implications for Trump's potential collusion, and the legal issues Cohen has faced. I'll also mention the check signed by Trump for the hush money, which ties into financial violations.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll start with Cohen's testimony, move into the specific claims about Trump and Stone, mention the lack of direct evidence but the suspicions, and then touch on other allegations like the Moscow tower and the racist remark. I'll conclude with the fact that Cohen's credibility is in question because he's admitted to lying before.

I need to make sure each morally framed word is included where appropriate. For example, using "hacked" when talking about the emails, "fraud" and "violations" when discussing Cohen's crimes, and "colluded" when referring to Trump's potential involvement with Russia.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to the facts presented in the article, while emphasizing the moral implications through the chosen words. The summary should be clear and direct, highlighting the key points without getting bogged down in too much detail.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts after "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." to meet the user's formatting requirements.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, revealing explosive claims about Trump's potential awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen alleges he overheard Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks' intentions to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign, a claim that raises questions about collusion. Cohen also accuses Trump of encouraging misleading claims about the Trump Tower Moscow project and failing to directly instruct him to lie to Congress. Additionally, Cohen mentions Trump's racist remark about "a country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole.’" Cohen plans to present a check signed by Trump to repay hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, further implicating Trump in financial fraud and campaign finance violations. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to crimes including bank fraud and lying to Congress, now seeks to spill details under oath, though his credibility is challenged due to past deceptions. END OF SUMMARY.
