Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me first read through the article to understand the key points. 

The article is about Michael Cohen's opening statement for his testimony. He's making several claims, including that he heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release emails that could harm Hillary Clinton. This is significant because it suggests Trump might have known about WikiLeaks' actions, which were linked to Russian intelligence. Cohen also mentions other things like Trump's awareness of the Moscow Tower discussions, a potential meeting with a Russian lawyer, and some racist remarks. He's presenting a check signed by Trump to pay Stormy Daniels. 

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points without going over 200 words. Also, the moral framing is important, so I should highlight the implications of Cohen's claims, like potential collusion and the ethical issues involved. I should structure the summary to include the main allegations, Cohen's credibility issues, and the context of Mueller's investigation. 

I should start by mentioning Cohen's testimony and the key claim about Trump and Stone. Then touch on the other allegations briefly, and note that Cohen's credibility is in question because he's admitted lying before. I need to keep it concise but comprehensive. Let me draft that and make sure it's under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, and his opening statement has already sparked controversy. Cohen claims he overheard Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, suggesting Trump may have been aware of WikiLeaks' activities, which Mueller linked to Russian intelligence. Cohen also alleges Trump encouraged misleading claims about the Trump Tower Moscow project, discussed a potential meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, and made racist remarks. Cohen plans to present a check from Trump to repay hush money to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen admits to lying to Congress before, he now aims to reveal all he knows about Trump, though his credibility is questioned. His testimony raises ethical concerns about potential collusion and Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans, though Mueller found no direct evidence of collusion. END OF SUMMARY.
