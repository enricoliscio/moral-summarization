SUMMARY: In his prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Michael Cohen made several explosive claims about his former client, Donald Trump. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, suggesting possible collusion with Russia. Cohen also provides a copy of a check signed by Trump to repay him for hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, indicating potential campaign finance violations. Cohen claims Trump encouraged him to mislead the public about discussions regarding Trump Tower Moscow and asked him to name a country run by a black person that wasn't a "shithole." While Cohen does not have direct evidence of collusion, his testimony raises further questions about Trump's involvement in potentially illegal activities. Cohen's statement comes after he pleaded guilty to financial crimes, bank fraud, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison. His willingness to testify against Trump suggests a bitter falling-out between the former associates.
END OF SUMMARY.
