SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee reveals explosive claims about Donald Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with Julian Assange and revealed plans to release damaging emails that would harm Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was in the loop about WikiLeaks' plans, which Special Counsel Robert Mueller has attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also makes claims about Trump's involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, his potential setup for Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, and Trump's racist remarks. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. Cohen's testimony raises questions about Trump's crimes, fraud, and violations, and whether he colluded with Russia to damage Clinton's campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
