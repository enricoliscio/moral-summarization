Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Cohen's testimony. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article starts by mentioning that Michael Cohen's opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee has been released. The New York Times obtained it and published it early Wednesday. The key point here is that Cohen claims Roger Stone told Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the campaign. This is significant because it's the most direct allegation that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' actions, which Mueller has linked to Russian intelligence.

Cohen also makes other claims about Trump's knowledge of the Trump Tower Moscow project, the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and some racist remarks. He plans to present a check from Trump to repay the Stormy Daniels hush money. Cohen's background is importantâ€”he was Trump's attorney and fixer but pleaded guilty to several crimes and is now serving a prison sentence. Since he has no reason to protect Trump anymore, he's expected to reveal a lot.

The article then delves into Cohen's specific claim about overhearing a call between Trump and Stone discussing WikiLeaks. The call was in July 2016, and Stone told Trump he spoke with Assange, who planned to release damaging emails against Clinton. This ties into the ongoing question of collusion, which Mueller hasn't definitively answered. Stone has denied these claims before.

Cohen's statement also includes other allegations, like Trump encouraging misleading statements about Trump Tower Moscow, Cohen's uncertainty about Trump Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer, and Trump's racist remark about African countries. The hearing is expected to be explosive.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Cohen's testimony, his claim about Trump and Stone discussing WikiLeaks, the implications for collusion, other allegations, and the significance of the hearing.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the main claim, then the details, and ending with the potential impact of the testimony. I need to ensure it's concise but covers all key aspects without getting too bogged down in specifics.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and captures all the essential elements.
