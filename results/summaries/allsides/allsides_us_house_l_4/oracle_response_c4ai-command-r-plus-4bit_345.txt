SUMMARY: Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday contains several explosive claims about Donald Trump's involvement in various unethical and illegal activities. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plan to release hacked emails, suggesting Trump's awareness of the situation. Cohen also provides insight into Trump's encouragement of misleading claims about the Trump Tower Moscow project and his potential awareness of the setup for the infamous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen's statement includes Trump's racist remarks and his involvement in hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. Cohen, Trump's former loyal fixer, has already admitted to lying to Congress and faces legal consequences for financial crimes, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations. Cohen's testimony raises suspicions of Trump's collusion with Russia, though direct evidence is lacking. Cohen's statement paints a picture of Trump's unethical and potentially illegal activities during the campaign and his presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
