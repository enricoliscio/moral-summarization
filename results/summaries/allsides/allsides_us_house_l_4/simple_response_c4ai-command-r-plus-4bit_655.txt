SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former personal attorney and "fixer" to Donald Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, providing an explosive opening statement. Cohen alleges he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign, suggesting possible collusion with Russia. Cohen also claims Trump's awareness of Trump Tower Moscow discussions and potential involvement in the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen will present a check signed by Trump to repay him for hush money to Stormy Daniels. He also alleges Trump made racist remarks in private. Cohen, convicted of financial crimes and lying to Congress, now seeks to expose Trump's secrets. The moral implications of these revelations are significant, as they suggest potential illegal activities, deception, and moral turpitude by Trump and his associates.

END OF SUMMARY.
