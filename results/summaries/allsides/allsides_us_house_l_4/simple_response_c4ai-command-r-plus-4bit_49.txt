SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former personal attorney and "fixer" to Donald Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, providing an explosive opening statement. Cohen alleges he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, suggesting Trump's awareness of the situation. Cohen also discusses Trump's knowledge of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and potential involvement in the Trump Jr.-Russian lawyer meeting. He plans to present a check signed by Trump to repay hush money to Stormy Daniels. Cohen's statement raises suspicions of Trump's collusion with Russia, although he lacks direct evidence. Cohen's testimony, despite his past untrustworthiness, may shed light on Trump's involvement in potentially unethical and illegal activities.

END OF SUMMARY.
