SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee contains several explosive allegations against Donald Trump. Cohen, who was once Trump's loyal personal attorney and "fixer," now claims to have heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen also alleges that Trump was aware of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and may have had knowledge of the infamous meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Cohen's statement includes purported racist remarks made by Trump and details of the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels, for which Cohen pleaded guilty to financial crimes, bank fraud, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress. Cohen will be challenged to corroborate his statements, but he claims to have his suspicions about Trump's potential collusion with Russia. He also plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump for the hush money payment. This testimony marks a bitter falling-out between Cohen and Trump, with Cohen now spilling all he knows about his former boss. 
END OF SUMMARY.
