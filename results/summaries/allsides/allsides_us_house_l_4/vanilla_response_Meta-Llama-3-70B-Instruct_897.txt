SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, has released his prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee. In it, he makes several explosive claims, including that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone in which Stone told Trump that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange planned to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen also claims that Trump was aware of discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow, and that he lied to Congress about it. Additionally, Cohen alleges that Trump made racist remarks in private and that he did "dirty work" on Trump's behalf. Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. While Cohen's credibility has been questioned due to his past lies to Congress, his testimony could be damaging to Trump.

END OF SUMMARY.
