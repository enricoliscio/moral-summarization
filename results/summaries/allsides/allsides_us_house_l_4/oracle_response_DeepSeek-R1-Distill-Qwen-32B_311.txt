Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Michael Cohen's testimony and the morally charged words he uses. I need to make sure I include those words like "hacked," "theft," "crimes," etc., in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Cohen is testifying, making several explosive claims. The key points are about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans, the check to Stormy Daniels, and other allegations like the Trump Tower meeting and racist remarks.

I need to structure the summary to highlight Cohen's claims, using the moral terms. I'll start by mentioning the testimony and the New York Times obtaining the statement. Then, I'll outline each major claim, ensuring to use the specified moral words. I should also note Cohen's background, like his guilty pleas, to add context.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise. Each point should be a sentence or two, focusing on the moral framing. I'll make sure to include all the key claims without getting too detailed. Finally, I'll end with the note that Cohen's credibility is in question because he's admitted lying before.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence includes the moral terms where appropriate. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit. Okay, that should cover all the necessary points while maintaining the moral perspective the author intended.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, and his prepared opening statement has raised significant moral and legal questions. Cohen claims to have overheard Trump discussing WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails with Roger Stone, suggesting Trump may have been aware of the scheme to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller has linked the theft of these emails to Russian intelligence. Cohen also alleges Trump encouraged misleading claims about the Trump Tower Moscow project, and that Trump Jr. set up a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Additionally, Cohen claims Trump made racist remarks and asks if he could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a “shithole.” Cohen plans to present a check signed by Trump to repay hush money to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen admits he lacks direct evidence of collusion, his claims add to the moral and legal scrutiny surrounding Trump's campaign. His credibility, however, is questioned due to his history of lying to Congress and financial crimes. END OF SUMMARY.
