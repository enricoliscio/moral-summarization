SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee contains some *explosive* and *damaging allegations* against Donald Trump. Cohen claims he heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, alleging Trump's *awareness* of the potential damage to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Cohen also provides *details* on Trump's *encouragement* of misleading claims about the Trump Tower Moscow project and *dirty work* he did on Trump's behalf. Cohen's statement includes *suspicions* of Trump's *collusion* with Russia, although he admits to lacking direct evidence. He also plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump to repay hush money to Stormy Daniels. Cohen, Trump's former *fixer*, is scheduled to begin serving a *prison sentence* in May and seems ready to *spill* Trump's secrets. However, his *credibility* is challenged due to past admissions of lying to Congress. This testimony raises further *suspicions* about Trump's involvement in the Russia investigation.
END OF SUMMARY.
