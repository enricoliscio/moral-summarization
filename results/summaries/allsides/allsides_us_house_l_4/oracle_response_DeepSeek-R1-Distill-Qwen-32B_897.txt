Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and the specific words to focus on: hacked, theft, crimes, fraud, violations, lying, colluded, damage. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Cohen is testifying, making several claims about Trump's knowledge of WikiLeaks' activities, which were hacked by Russian intelligence. There's also mention of financial crimes, lying to Congress, and potential collusion. 

I need to make sure the summary includes all those morally charged words. I'll start by highlighting Cohen's explosive claims, using "hacked" and "theft" as Mueller's findings. Then, mention the lack of direct evidence but his suspicions, using "colluded." 

I should include the specific points about Trump's awareness, the Trump Tower discussions, the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and the racist remark. Also, note Cohen's own crimes and his motivation to testify now. 

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Cohen's testimony, his claims, the implications, and his credibility issues. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key moral terms.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." without any markdown. I'll check the word count to ensure compliance.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, making explosive claims about Trump's potential awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen alleges he overheard a call where Trump and Roger Stone discussed WikiLeaks, with Stone claiming to have spoken directly to Julian Assange about a massive email dump to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This claim adds to ongoing questions about collusion, though Cohen lacks direct evidence. He also claims Trump encouraged misleading statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project, and he witnessed Trump Jr.'s arrangement for a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen further alleges Trump made racist remarks and asked about a "country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole.’" Cohen, who pleaded guilty to financial crimes, fraud, and lying to Congress, now seeks to spill details about Trump under oath, despite his own credibility issues. His testimony promises to reignite debates about Russia ties and ethical violations. END OF SUMMARY.
