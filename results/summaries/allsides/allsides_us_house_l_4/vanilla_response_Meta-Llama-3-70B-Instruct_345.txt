SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee has been released, and it contains several explosive claims. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Donald Trump and Roger Stone in July 2016, in which Stone told Trump that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange planned to release hacked emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also claims that Trump was aware of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, and that he encouraged Cohen to make misleading claims about the project. Additionally, Cohen alleges that Trump made racist remarks in private and that he was involved in setting up a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen's credibility has been questioned due to his past lies to Congress, his testimony promises to be explosive.

END OF SUMMARY.
