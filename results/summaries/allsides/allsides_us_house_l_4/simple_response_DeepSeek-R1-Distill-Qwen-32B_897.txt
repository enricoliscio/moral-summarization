Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Cohen's testimony. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Cohen's opening statement where he claims Trump knew about WikiLeaks' plans through Roger Stone. He also mentions other things like the Moscow tower, the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and some racist remarks. Cohen is a former Trump attorney who's now testifying after his guilty pleas.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral aspects, like potential collusion and ethical issues. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start by mentioning Cohen's testimony and the key points, then touch on his credibility and the implications.

Let me outline the main points: Cohen's claims about Trump and Stone, the lack of direct evidence, other allegations, his credibility issues, and the significance of the testimony. I'll make sure to include that Mueller is investigating and the implications for Trump.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it concise. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens. Let me put it all together, making sure each sentence flows logically and covers all the essential moral framing elements.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, revealing explosive claims about Trump's alleged awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen claims he overheard a conversation between Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks' intentions to release damaging emails targeting Hillary Clinton, a move Mueller attributes to Russian intelligence. While Cohen lacks direct evidence of collusion, his testimony raises suspicions about Trump's knowledge of WikiLeaks' activities. Cohen also alleges Trump encouraged him to make misleading statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project and may have known about a meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. Additionally, Cohen claims Trump made racist remarks in private. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to financial crimes and lied to Congress, faces credibility challenges. His testimony promises to be a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny of Trump's ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
