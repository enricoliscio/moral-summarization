Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the key points and the ethical implications presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Michael Cohen's opening statement is the focus. He makes several claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans, which ties into the Russia investigation. Cohen also mentions other issues like the Trump Tower in Moscow, Stormy Daniels, and some controversial remarks by Trump.

I should highlight the moral aspects, such as Cohen's role as Trump's fixer, his guilty pleas, and his decision to testify now. The article also questions the credibility of Cohen's claims since he has lied before. The potential collusion with Russia is a big moral issue, and Cohen's lack of direct evidence adds complexity.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points: Cohen's testimony, his claims about Trump and WikiLeaks, the implications for the Russia investigation, and the credibility issues. I'll make sure to mention that Cohen's statements are uncorroborated and the moral questions they raise.

Putting it all together, the summary should convey the explosive nature of Cohen's testimony, the specific claims, and the ethical concerns without getting bogged down in too many details.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, has released a explosive opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee. Cohen alleges that he overheard Trump discussing WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails with Roger Stone in July 2016, suggesting Trump may have been aware of Assange's intentions. Cohen also claims Trump encouraged him to make misleading statements about the Trump Tower in Moscow and that Trump Jr. discussed a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen further accuses Trump of making racist remarks and admits to using hush money to pay Stormy Daniels while Trump was president. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to financial crimes and lied to Congress, now seeks to testify against Trump, though his credibility is questioned. His claims, while uncorroborated, raise ethical and legal concerns about Trump's potential awareness of WikiLeaks' activities and the broader Russia investigation. END OF SUMMARY.
