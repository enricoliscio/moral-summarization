SUMMARY: In his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," made several explosive claims. Cohen alleged that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, suggesting Trump's awareness of the impending damage to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Cohen also presented a check signed by Trump to repay him for hush money paid to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Cohen's statement includes further claims of Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and potential involvement in the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen, who has previously admitted to lying to Congress and been convicted of financial crimes, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations, now faces the challenge of corroborating his statements. Cohen's testimony raises suspicions of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, with Cohen claiming Trump's knowledge of hacked emails and potential involvement in their release. Cohen's opening statement paints a picture of Trump's alleged involvement in various unethical and potentially illegal activities, including fraud, violations, and lying to Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
