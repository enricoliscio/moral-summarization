SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee has been released, and it contains explosive claims about President Trump's involvement in various scandals. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone in July 2016, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about plans to release hacked emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also claims that Trump was aware of discussions to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, and that he encouraged Cohen to make misleading public statements about the project. Additionally, Cohen alleges that Trump made racist remarks in private and that he was involved in setting up a meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Cohen will also present a copy of a check signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen's credibility has been questioned due to his past lies to Congress, his testimony promises to be explosive.

END OF SUMMARY.
