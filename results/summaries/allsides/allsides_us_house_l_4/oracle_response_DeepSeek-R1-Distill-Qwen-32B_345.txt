Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Cohen's testimony while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words: hacked, theft, crimes, fraud, violations, lying, colluded, damage. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Cohen is testifying and making several claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans, which were hacked by Russian intelligence. He also mentions financial crimes, lying to Congress, and other morally charged topics.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, under 200 words, using those specific words. I'll start by highlighting Cohen's testimony, the hacked emails, and the implication of Trump's awareness. Then, mention the financial crimes and lying to Congress. Also, include the potential collusion and the impact on Hillary's campaign. I'll make sure to use the words like 'hacked,' 'theft,' 'crimes,' 'fraud,' 'lying,' 'colluded,' and 'damage' where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to flow logically: introduce Cohen and his claims, detail the specific allegations, mention Mueller's investigation, and conclude with the implications. I need to ensure that each morally framed word is contextually accurate and fits naturally into the summary.

Let me draft a version and check the word count. If it's over, I'll trim any unnecessary details while keeping the moral framing intact. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, revealing explosive claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen alleges he overheard Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks' intentions to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign, with Stone claiming direct contact with Julian Assange. Cohen also claims Trump encouraged misleading statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project and acknowledges financial crimes, including lying to Congress. He plans to present evidence of Trump's payment to Stormy Daniels. Mueller has linked the email theft to Russian intelligence, raising questions about potential collusion. Cohen's testimony, though lacking direct evidence, adds to the narrative of Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans, with Stone's actions under scrutiny. Cohen's credibility is challenged due to his prior lies to Congress. His claims, if true, could further damage Trump's reputation. END OF SUMMARY.
