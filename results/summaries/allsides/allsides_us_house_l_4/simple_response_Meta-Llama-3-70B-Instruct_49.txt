SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, has released his prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee. The statement contains explosive claims, including that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone in which they discussed WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen alleges that Stone told Trump about Julian Assange's plans, which would have been shortly before WikiLeaks posted the Democratic National Committee's hacked emails. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also makes claims about Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, the potential setup for Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, and Trump's purported racist remarks. The statement raises questions about Trump's involvement in Russian interference and his honesty, but Cohen's credibility is challenged by his past lies to Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
