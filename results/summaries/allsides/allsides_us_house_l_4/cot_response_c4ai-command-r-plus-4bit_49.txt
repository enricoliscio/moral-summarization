SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," is set to deliver explosive testimony before the House Oversight Committee. Cohen's prepared opening statement includes some very controversial allegations against Trump. Cohen claims he heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plan to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, which would be the most direct allegation of Trump's awareness of the situation. Cohen also discusses Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and provides a check signed by Trump to repay him for the hush money payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Cohen admits to doing "dirty work" on Trump's behalf and plans to publicly spill all he knows about Trump, under oath. He also addresses purported racist remarks made by Trump, including asking Cohen to name a country run by a black person that wasn't a "shithole." While Cohen does not have direct evidence of collusion with Russia, he expresses his suspicions. Cohen's statement includes some misleading claims and lacks full corroboration, but it certainly adds fuel to the fire of ongoing investigations.
END OF SUMMARY.
