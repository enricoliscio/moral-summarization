SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, has prepared a bombshell opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which Special Counsel Robert Mueller has attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also claims that Trump encouraged him to make misleading claims about Trump Tower Moscow discussions and that he lied to Congress about the project. Additionally, Cohen alleges that Trump made racist remarks in private and that he was involved in dirty work, including a hush money payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Cohen's statement also includes claims of fraud, violations, and lying, and raises suspicions of collusion with Russia. However, Cohen's credibility is questionable, having admitted to lying to Congress in the past.

END OF SUMMARY.
