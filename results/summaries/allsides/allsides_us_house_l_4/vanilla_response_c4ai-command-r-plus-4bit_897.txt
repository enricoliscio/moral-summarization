SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, and his prepared opening statement includes several explosive claims about Trump's involvement in the 2016 campaign and potential collusion with Russia. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails, providing the most direct evidence yet that Trump may have known about the impending release. Cohen also plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump to pay Cohen back for hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen makes further claims about Trump's awareness of Trump Tower Moscow discussions and purported racist remarks made by Trump in private. Cohen's testimony comes after he pleaded guilty to financial crimes, bank fraud, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison. While Cohen's statements are yet to be corroborated, they provide a glimpse into the inner workings of Trump's campaign and business dealings, and could have significant implications for the ongoing investigations into potential collusion with Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
