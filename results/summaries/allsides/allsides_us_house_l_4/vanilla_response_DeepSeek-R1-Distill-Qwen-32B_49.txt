Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Michael Cohen's testimony. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about Cohen's opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee. He's making some explosive claims. One major point is that Cohen heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the campaign. That's significant because it suggests Trump might have been aware of WikiLeaks' actions, which Mueller has linked to Russian intelligence.

Cohen also mentions a check signed by Trump to pay Stormy Daniels, which is part of the hush money. He's planning to present that as evidence. Additionally, Cohen discusses Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow project and a meeting with a Russian lawyer, though he can't prove it. There's also a mention of Trump making racist remarks, which is another serious allegation.

Cohen's background is important too. He was Trump's attorney and fixer, but after pleading guilty to several charges, he's now testifying against Trump. His credibility is in question because he's admitted lying to Congress before.

The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, within 200 words. I should structure it to highlight the main allegations, Cohen's credibility issues, and the implications of his testimony.

I'll start by stating that Cohen's statement is explosive, then list the key claims: Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks via Stone, the check to Stormy Daniels, the Moscow project, the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and the racist remarks. Then mention Cohen's background and the fact that his testimony is under oath but his credibility is challenged.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and sticks to the main points without getting too detailed. Also, I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise with each point.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure to include all these elements in a logical flow.
