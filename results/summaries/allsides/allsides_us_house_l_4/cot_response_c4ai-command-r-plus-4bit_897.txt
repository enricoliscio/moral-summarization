SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, and his prepared opening statement includes some *explosive* allegations. Cohen claims he heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign, suggesting *awareness* and potential *collusion*. Cohen also discusses Trump's *awareness* of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and the potential setup of the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, as well as Trump's *racist* remarks. Cohen plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump to pay Cohen back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen does not have direct evidence of *collusion*, he expresses his *suspicions*. Cohen's testimony comes after his *falling-out* with Trump and his guilty pleas for *financial crimes*, *bank fraud*, *campaign finance violations*, and *lying* to Congress, for which he will soon be *incarcerated*. Cohen now appears ready to *spill* Trump's secrets, but his credibility is questioned given his past *lies*.
END OF SUMMARY.
