Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure to follow, so I should make sure to adhere to that.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main subject is Michael Cohen's testimony, which includes several allegations against Trump. I need to identify the morally charged words. These are words that carry a judgment or imply wrongdoing, like "explosive," "lied," "collusion," etc.

Next, I'll list each of these words as per the user's instructions. I should make sure to capture all of them, even if some are repeated. Once that's done, I'll move on to summarizing the article.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main points: Cohen's testimony, the claims about Trump's knowledge of WikiLeaks, the check to Stormy Daniels, the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and the racist remark. I'll also mention Cohen's past lies and the implications of his testimony.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without getting bogged down in details. It's important to highlight the moral implications, so using words like "explosive," "lied," and "collusion" will help maintain the author's framing.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it's within the word limit and that all key points are included. I'll also check that the morally framed words are appropriately used to reflect the article's tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, with his opening statement already making headlines. Cohen claims he overheard Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails damaging Hillary Clinton's campaign, a claim Mueller has linked to Russian intelligence. Cohen also alleges Trump was aware of the Trump Tower Moscow deal and the meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, though he lacks direct evidence of collusion. Additionally, Cohen claims Trump asked him if he could name a country run by a black person that wasnâ€™t a "shithole." Cohen plans to present a check Trump signed to pay Stormy Daniels hush money. Despite his guilty pleas for financial crimes and lying to Congress, Cohen now aims to reveal Trump's secrets, though his credibility is questioned due to past deceptions. His testimony promises to be explosive, with moral implications surrounding Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans and potential collusion. END OF SUMMARY.
