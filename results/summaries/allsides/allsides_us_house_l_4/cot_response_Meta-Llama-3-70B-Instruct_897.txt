SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, making explosive claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with Julian Assange about a "massive dump of emails" that would "damage" Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was in the loop about WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also claims that Trump encouraged him to make "misleading" claims about Trump Tower Moscow and made "racist" remarks in private. Additionally, Cohen will present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Cohen's testimony is expected to be a doozy, but his credibility will be challenged due to his past "lying" to Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
