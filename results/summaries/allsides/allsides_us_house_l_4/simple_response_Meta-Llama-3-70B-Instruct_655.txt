SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee reveals explosive claims about Donald Trump's knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with Julian Assange and revealed that WikiLeaks would soon release emails damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which are attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also makes claims about Trump's awareness of Trump Tower Moscow discussions, a meeting with a Russian lawyer, and racist remarks made in private. Furthermore, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen's credibility is questionable due to his past lies to Congress, his testimony promises to be explosive and raises serious questions about Trump's integrity and potential collusion with Russia.

END OF SUMMARY.
