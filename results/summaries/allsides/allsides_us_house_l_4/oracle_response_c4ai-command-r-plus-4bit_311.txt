SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to deliver explosive testimony before the House Oversight Committee, providing a glimpse into Trump's business practices and hush money payments. In his prepared opening statement, Cohen makes several damning claims, alleging that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign and that Trump encouraged him to publicly mislead about talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen also alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about the upcoming release of hacked emails, which would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Cohen's statement raises suspicions of collusion, though he lacks direct evidence. Additionally, Cohen provides insight into Trump's racist remarks and implicates Trump in potential campaign finance violations. Cohen, who previously pled guilty to financial crimes, bank fraud, and lying to Congress, now faces the challenge of corroborating his statements. His testimony, however, sheds light on the moral and legal transgressions potentially committed by Trump and his associates.

END OF SUMMARY.
