SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee is explosive. Cohen claims he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, where Stone told Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was in the loop about WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also alleges that Trump encouraged him to make misleading claims about talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and made racist remarks in private, calling a country run by a black person a "shithole." Cohen, who pleaded guilty to financial crimes, bank fraud, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress, plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. With no further reason to keep Trump's secrets, Cohen now seems to want to spill all he knows about Trump, under oath. However, his credibility will be challenged due to his past lying to Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
