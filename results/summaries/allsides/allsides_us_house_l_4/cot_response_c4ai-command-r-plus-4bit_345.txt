SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, and his prepared opening statement includes some *explosive* allegations. Cohen claims he heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, despite Stone's denials. Cohen also discusses Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and potential involvement in the Trump Jr.-Russia meeting at Trump Tower, as well as Trump's purported *racist* remarks. Cohen plans to present a check signed by Trump to repay him for the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen, who was previously sentenced to three years in prison for *crimes*, including *bank fraud*, *campaign finance violations*, and *lying* to Congress, now seems eager to reveal all he knows about Trump. He expresses his *suspicions* about collusion and provides *dramatic* details about overhearing Stone's call with Trump. Cohen also addresses other topics, including Trump's encouragement to make *misleading* claims about the Trump Tower Moscow project and Trump's *racist* question about countries run by Black people. Cohen's testimony promises to be *doozy*, with potential implications for the ongoing investigations into Trump and his campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
