SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared testimony before the House Oversight Committee has been released, and it's a bombshell. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Donald Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which Special Counsel Robert Mueller has attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also claims that Trump encouraged him to make misleading claims about Trump Tower Moscow discussions and that he lied to Congress about the project. Additionally, Cohen alleges that Trump made racist remarks in private and that he was involved in dirty work on Trump's behalf. Cohen plans to present evidence, including a check signed by Trump, to corroborate his claims. However, Cohen's credibility is questionable, as he has admitted to lying to Congress in the past.

END OF SUMMARY.
