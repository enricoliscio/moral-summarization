SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee has been released, and it contains explosive claims about Donald Trump's knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone in July 2016, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with Julian Assange and predicted a "massive dump of emails" that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also makes claims about Trump's awareness of Trump Tower Moscow discussions, the setup for Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, and Trump's racist remarks in private. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay Cohen back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen's credibility has been questioned due to his past lies to Congress, his testimony promises to be explosive.

END OF SUMMARY.
