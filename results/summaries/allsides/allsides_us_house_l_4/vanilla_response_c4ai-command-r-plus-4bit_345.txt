SUMMARY: In his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney, made several explosive claims. Cohen alleged that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, suggesting Trump's awareness of the situation. Cohen also discussed Trump Tower Moscow discussions, a potential meeting setup between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, and Trump's purported racist remarks. Cohen plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump to repay Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. While Cohen does not have direct evidence of collusion with Russia, he expresses his suspicions. Cohen's testimony raises questions about the extent of Trump's knowledge regarding WikiLeaks and Russia's involvement in the election. Cohen's credibility is in question due to his previous lies to Congress, but his statements offer insights into Trump's activities.

END OF SUMMARY.
