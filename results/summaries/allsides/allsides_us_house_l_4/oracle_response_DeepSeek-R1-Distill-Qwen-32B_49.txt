Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Cohen's testimony. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author used, and they've provided a list of morally charged words to include. I should make sure to use as many of those as possible without making the summary too long—under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Cohen is testifying before the House Oversight Committee. He's making several explosive claims, including that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails. The author uses words like "hacked," "theft," "crimes," "fraud," "violations," "lying," "colluded," and "damage." I need to incorporate these into the summary.

Cohen's key points include overheard conversations with Stone and Trump about WikiLeaks, which Mueller is investigating as a Russian intelligence operation. He also mentions the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Trump's racist remarks, and the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Cohen's credibility is in question because he's admitted lying to Congress before.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points, using the moral terms where appropriate. I'll start with Cohen's testimony, his claims about Trump's awareness, the specific allegations, and then touch on his credibility issues. I need to keep it concise, making sure each sentence adds value without exceeding the word limit.

I also need to mention that Cohen is now testifying after falling out with Trump and facing prison time, which adds context to his motives. The summary should end by noting that his credibility is a factor in how his claims are received.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each point is covered with the appropriate moral language. I'll check the word count as I go to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, revealing explosive claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen alleges he overheard Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks' intentions, including a "massive dump of emails" to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign—a claim Mueller has linked to Russian intelligence theft. Cohen also accuses Trump of encouraging misleading claims about the Trump Tower Moscow project, and mentions a potential meeting between Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. Additionally, Cohen claims Trump made racist remarks and asked if any "country run by a black person" wasn't a "shithole." Cohen plans to present evidence of a check signed by Trump to pay Stormy Daniels hush money, despite admitting to lying to Congress and pleading guilty to financial crimes, fraud, and campaign violations. His credibility is questioned, but his testimony could reignite debates about collusion and damage to the Clinton campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
