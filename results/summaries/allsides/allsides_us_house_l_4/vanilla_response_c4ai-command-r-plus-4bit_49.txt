SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. In his prepared opening statement, Cohen makes several explosive claims, including hearing Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen also discusses Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, the potential setup of the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, and Trump's purported racist remarks. Cohen plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump in 2017 to repay him for the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen admits to previously lying to Congress and faces the challenge of corroborating his statements. Cohen's most significant claim is that he overheard Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans, providing the most direct allegation of Trump's knowledge. Cohen also alleges that Trump encouraged him to mislead the public about the Trump Tower Moscow talks and that Trump asked him to name a country run by a black person that wasn't a "shithole." Cohen's testimony promises to provide valuable insights into Trump's business practices and potential involvement in Russia-related matters.
END OF SUMMARY.
