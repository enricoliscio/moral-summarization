SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, with an explosive opening statement. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 presidential campaign. Cohen also claims Trump was aware of discussions regarding Trump Tower Moscow and that he saw Donald Trump Jr. tell his father about setting up a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen intends to present a copy of a check signed by Trump to pay Cohen back for hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen also mentions Trump's purported racist remarks and his own past crimes. Cohen's statement offers new insights into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as Trump's involvement in various unethical activities. However, Cohen's credibility is in question due to his past admission of lying to Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
