SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen's prepared testimony before the House Oversight Committee is explosive, with claims that could further tarnish President Trump's reputation. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange about a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is a suspicious claim, and Cohen's account raises questions about what Trump knew about WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also makes other damning allegations, including that Trump encouraged him to make misleading claims about Trump Tower Moscow and that Trump made racist remarks in private. Cohen's testimony is expected to be dramatic, with the former "fixer" presenting a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. With Cohen's credibility in question due to his past lying to Congress, his testimony will be closely scrutinized. END OF SUMMARY.
