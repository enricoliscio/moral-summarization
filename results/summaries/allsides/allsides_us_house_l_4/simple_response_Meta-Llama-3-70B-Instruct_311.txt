SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen, former personal attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, has prepared an explosive opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which are attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also makes claims about Trump's awareness of Trump Tower Moscow discussions, a meeting with a Russian lawyer, and purported racist remarks. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen has admitted lying to Congress in the past, his testimony could be damaging to Trump. The question remains: what did Trump know about WikiLeaks' plans, and when did he know it?

END OF SUMMARY.
