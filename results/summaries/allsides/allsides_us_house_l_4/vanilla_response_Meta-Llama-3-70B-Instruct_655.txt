SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for Donald Trump, has released his prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee. The statement includes explosive claims, including that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone in July 2016, in which Stone told Trump that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange planned to release hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Cohen also claims Trump was aware of discussions to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and made racist remarks in private. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen's statements are uncorroborated and he has admitted to lying to Congress in the past, his testimony could be damaging to Trump. Cohen's claims are the most direct allegations yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans during the presidential campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
