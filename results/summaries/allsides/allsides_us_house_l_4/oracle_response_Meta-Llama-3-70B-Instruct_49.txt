SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared testimony before the House Oversight Committee has been released, and it's a bombshell. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Donald Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with WikiLeaks' Julian Assange about releasing hacked emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which Special Counsel Robert Mueller has attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also claims that Trump encouraged him to make misleading claims about Trump Tower Moscow and that he lied to Congress about it. Furthermore, Cohen alleges that Trump made racist remarks in private and that he paid Cohen hush money to cover up an affair with a porn actress. Cohen's testimony is explosive, but his credibility is questionable given his past lies to Congress. Nevertheless, his allegations of fraud, violations, and lying by Trump and his associates are serious and damaging.

END OF SUMMARY.
