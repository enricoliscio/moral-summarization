Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Cohen's testimony. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Michael Cohen's opening statement for his testimony is out, and it's quite explosive. The New York Times got the statement and published it. The main claim is that Cohen heard Roger Stone tell Trump about Assange's plans to release hacked emails during the campaign. This is significant because it suggests Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' activities, which Mueller is investigating as tied to Russian intelligence.

Cohen also makes other claims about Trump's knowledge of the Moscow Tower discussions, the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and racist remarks. He plans to present a check from Trump to pay Stormy Daniels, which is part of the hush money. Cohen's background is mentionedâ€”he was Trump's attorney, pleaded guilty to several crimes, and is set to serve three years in prison, hence why he's now testifying.

The article details Cohen's claims about overhearing a call between Trump and Stone in July 2016, where Stone said he spoke with Assange and that there would be a massive email dump to hurt Clinton. This ties into the timing of WikiLeaks' releases, which Mueller linked to Russian hacking. It's noted that Mueller's indictment of Stone didn't clarify his knowledge fully, so Cohen's testimony adds more details.

Cohen also mentions Trump encouraging him to make misleading statements about the Moscow Tower, not directly telling him to lie to Congress about it, and seeing Trump Jr. set up a meeting that might be the one with the Russian lawyer. Additionally, Cohen claims Trump asked about countries run by black people, suggesting a racist remark.

The hearing is expected to be explosive, covering Trump's business practices and hush money.

Now, I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main points: Cohen's testimony, the key claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks via Stone, the check to Stormy Daniels, other allegations like the Moscow Tower and racist remarks, and the implications of his testimony.

I should structure it to start with Cohen's testimony and the main claim, then mention other allegations, his background, and the significance of the hearing. I need to keep it clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details.

Let me draft it:

"Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, making explosive claims. Cohen alleges he overheard Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails damaging Hillary Clinton's campaign, suggesting Trump was aware of Assange's intentions. This aligns with Mueller's investigation linking the emails to Russian intelligence. Cohen also claims Trump encouraged misleading statements about the Trump Tower in Moscow, and he saw Trump Jr. arrange a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a check from Trump to pay Stormy Daniels. He also alleges Trump made racist remarks. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to financial crimes, is now testifying after a falling-out with Trump. His testimony promises to be a key moment in the ongoing Russia investigation."

Wait, that's over 200 words. Let me check the word count. Maybe I can make it more concise by removing some details.

Hmm, that's still a bit long. Maybe I can combine some sentences or remove less critical details.

"Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, is set to testify, making explosive claims. He alleges Trump knew of WikiLeaks' plans via Roger Stone, suggesting collusion. Cohen also claims Trump encouraged misleading statements about the Moscow Tower, saw Trump Jr. arrange a meeting with a Russian lawyer, and plans to present a check to Stormy Daniels. He alleges Trump made racist remarks. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to crimes, is now testifying, promising a key moment in the Russia investigation."

That's better, around 100 words. I think that captures the main points succinctly.
