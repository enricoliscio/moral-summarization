SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former personal attorney and "fixer" to Donald Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, providing an explosive opening statement. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, suggesting Trump's awareness of Russian interference. Cohen also claims Trump encouraged misleading statements about Trump Tower Moscow discussions and was aware of the potential setup for the infamous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a check signed by Trump as proof of hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen does not have direct evidence of collusion, his suspicions are significant. He also reveals Trump's purported racist remarks, further damaging Trump's reputation. Cohen, having already admitted to lying to Congress, now seeks to expose Trump's secrets, potentially offering crucial insights into the Trump-Russia investigation.

END OF SUMMARY.
