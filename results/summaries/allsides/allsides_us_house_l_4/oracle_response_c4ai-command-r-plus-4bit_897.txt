SUMMARY: In his prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Michael Cohen makes several explosive claims about Donald Trump's involvement in various immoral and illegal activities. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plan to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, suggesting Trump's knowledge of the situation. Cohen also provides insight into Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, the potential setup of the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, and Trump's purported racist remarks. Cohen intends to present a copy of a check signed by Trump to repay him for the hush money payoff to Stormy Daniels. Cohen, once Trump's loyal fixer, now faces prison time for financial crimes, bank fraud, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress. While Cohen does not have direct evidence of collusion with Russia, he details a call where Stone informed Trump of Assange's plans to release damaging emails, hacked by Russian intelligence officers. Cohen's testimony raises serious moral and legal concerns regarding Trump's involvement in these activities.
END OF SUMMARY.
