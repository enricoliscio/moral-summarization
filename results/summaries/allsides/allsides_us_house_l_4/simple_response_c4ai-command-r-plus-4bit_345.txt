SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, providing an explosive opening statement. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, suggesting Trump's awareness of the situation. Cohen also discusses Trump's knowledge of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and potential involvement in the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. He claims Trump made racist remarks and presents a check signed by Trump to repay hush money to Stormy Daniels. Cohen admits his past lies to Congress and acknowledges a lack of direct evidence of collusion, but expresses his suspicions. He faces the challenge of corroborating his statements, given his previous convictions for financial crimes, bank fraud, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress. Cohen's testimony raises further questions about Trump's involvement in potentially unethical or illegal activities.
END OF SUMMARY.
