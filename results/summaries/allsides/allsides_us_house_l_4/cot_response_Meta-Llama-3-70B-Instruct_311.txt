SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee reveals explosive claims about Donald Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with Julian Assange about a "massive dump of emails" that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This raises suspicions of collusion and lying. Cohen also claims that Trump encouraged him to make misleading claims about Trump Tower Moscow and made racist remarks, calling a country run by a black person a "shithole." Additionally, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the hush money payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. With no further reason to keep Trump's secrets, Cohen seems to want to spill all he knows about Trump, under oath. However, his credibility is challenged due to his past admission of lying to Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
