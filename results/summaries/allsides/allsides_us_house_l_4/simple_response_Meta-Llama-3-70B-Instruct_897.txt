SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared opening statement for his testimony before the House Oversight Committee reveals explosive claims about Donald Trump's knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with Julian Assange and revealed plans to release emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which are attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also makes claims about Trump's awareness of Trump Tower Moscow discussions, a potential setup for Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, and Trump's purported racist remarks. Cohen's statement raises questions about Trump's involvement in the 2016 election and his loyalty to the truth. However, Cohen's credibility is challenged by his past admissions of lying to Congress.

END OF SUMMARY.
