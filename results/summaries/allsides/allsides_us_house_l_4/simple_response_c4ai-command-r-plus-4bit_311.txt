SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee, providing an explosive opening statement. Cohen alleges that he heard Roger Stone inform Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the presidential campaign, suggesting Trump's awareness of the situation. Cohen also claims Trump encouraged him to mislead the public about the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and that Trump made racist remarks in private. Cohen plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump as proof of hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. While Cohen does not have direct evidence of collusion with Russia, his suspicions are strong, and he intends to reveal all he knows about Trump under oath. Cohen's testimony raises serious moral and ethical concerns about Trump's conduct during the campaign and as president. It remains to be seen if Cohen's statements can be corroborated, given his previous lies to Congress. Nonetheless, his testimony has the potential to significantly impact public perception and the ongoing investigations into Trump and his associates.
END OF SUMMARY.
