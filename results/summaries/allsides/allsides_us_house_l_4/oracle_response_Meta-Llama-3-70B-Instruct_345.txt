SUMMARY:

Michael Cohen's prepared testimony before the House Oversight Committee reveals explosive allegations against Donald Trump. Cohen claims he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, where Stone told Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails, stolen by Russian intelligence officers, to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans. Cohen also alleges that Trump encouraged him to make misleading claims about Trump Tower Moscow and asked him to lie about the project to Congress. Additionally, Cohen accuses Trump of making racist remarks and paying hush money to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Cohen's testimony also sheds light on Trump's awareness of the Trump Tower Moscow discussions and the setup for Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen's claims, although uncorroborated, paint a picture of a president involved in fraudulent activities, lying, and colluding with Russia.

END OF SUMMARY.
