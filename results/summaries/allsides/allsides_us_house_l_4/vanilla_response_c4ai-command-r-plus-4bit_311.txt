SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney and "fixer," is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. Cohen's prepared opening statement includes several explosive claims, including that he heard Roger Stone tell Trump about WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen also plans to present a copy of a check signed by Trump to repay him for hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen claims Trump encouraged him to make misleading statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project and asked him if he could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a "shithole." Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for financial crimes, bank fraud, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress. He now appears willing to reveal what he knows about Trump, despite previously keeping his secrets. Cohen's testimony will likely be challenged due to his admitted past lies to Congress.
