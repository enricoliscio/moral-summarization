SUMMARY:
Michael Cohen, former attorney and "fixer" for President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee with explosive claims. Cohen alleges that he overheard a call between Trump and Roger Stone, in which Stone claimed to have spoken with WikiLeaks' Julian Assange about releasing hacked emails during the presidential campaign. This is the most direct allegation yet that Trump was aware of WikiLeaks' plans, which Special Counsel Robert Mueller has attributed to Russian intelligence officers. Cohen also claims that Trump encouraged him to make "misleading" claims about Trump Tower Moscow and made "racist" remarks in private. Additionally, Cohen plans to present a copy of a check personally signed by Trump to pay him back for the "hush money" payoff to porn actress Stormy Daniels. While Cohen has admitted to "lying" to Congress in the past, his testimony could be damaging to Trump's reputation. END OF SUMMARY.
