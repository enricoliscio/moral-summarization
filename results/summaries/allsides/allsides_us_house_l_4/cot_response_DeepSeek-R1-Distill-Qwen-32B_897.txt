Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and specific instructions. First, I need to identify all the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again. Words like "explosive," "allegation," "collusion," "dirty work," "lied," "corroborate," "secret," "spill," "secrets," "under oath," "fixer," "fraud," "violations," "lying," "sentence," "mystery," "deny," "misleading," "shithole." These all carry moral connotations.

Next, I have to write a concise summary using these words. The summary should be under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: Cohen's testimony, his claims about Trump and Stone, the context of Mueller's investigation, the check to Stormy Daniels, Cohen's past actions, and the implications of his testimony. I need to make sure to include the morally charged words without making the summary too long.

I should structure it to highlight Cohen's explosive claims, the lack of direct evidence, the potential collusion, the check as proof, and the overall impact on Trump's image. I'll also mention the corroboration issues and the fact that Cohen is now testifying after his fall-out with Trump.

Putting it all together, I'll ensure each morally framed word is included naturally within the summary. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Let me draft it now, making sure it flows well and covers all key points succinctly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Michael Cohen, former Trump attorney, plans to testify before the House Oversight Committee, making explosive claims about Trump's awareness of WikiLeaks' plans to release hacked emails during the 2016 campaign. Cohen alleges he overheard Trump and Roger Stone discussing WikiLeaks, with Stone claiming to have spoken directly to Julian Assange about releasing emails damaging to Hillary Clinton. Cohen also claims Trump encouraged him to make misleading statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project and admitted to racist remarks. Cohen will present a check from Trump to Stormy Daniels as proof of hush money. Despite no direct evidence of collusion, Cohen's testimony raises suspicions about Trump's knowledge of WikiLeaks' activities. Cohen, who has already pleaded guilty to financial crimes and lied to Congress, faces challenges in corroborating his claims. His testimony promises to be a major event in the ongoing investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. END OF SUMMARY.
