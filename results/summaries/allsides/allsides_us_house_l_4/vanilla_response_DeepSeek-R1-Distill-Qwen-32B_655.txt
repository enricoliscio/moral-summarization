Alright, I need to help the user summarize this news article about Michael Cohen's testimony. The user is a news summarizer assistant, so they want a concise and accurate summary. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the key points are Cohen's opening statement, his claims about Trump and WikiLeaks, the role of Mueller, the check to Stormy Daniels, and Cohen's background. I should highlight the most explosive claims, like Cohen hearing Trump and Stone discuss WikiLeaks, which Mueller linked to Russian interference.

I also need to mention Cohen's guilty pleas and his motivation to testify now. The summary should be under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main allegations without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to cover the main events and implications, ensuring it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee. In his prepared opening statement, Cohen claims he overheard a conversation between Trump and Roger Stone in July 2016, where Stone told Trump that Julian Assange planned to release hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Cohen also alleges Trump was aware of the Trump Tower Moscow project and the potential setup for Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer. Cohen plans to present a check signed by Trump to repay hush money to Stormy Daniels. He has pleaded guilty to financial crimes and is set to begin a three-year prison sentence in May. Cohen’s claims, while lacking direct evidence of collusion, suggest Trump may have been aware of WikiLeaks’ plans, which Mueller linked to Russian interference. Cohen’s testimony promises to be explosive, though his credibility may be challenged due to his past lies to Congress. END OF SUMMARY.
