SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, warning of civil disobedience and restricted religious liberty. The ruling is seen as an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" by some, who believe the court has "succumbed to demands to invent a new constitutional 'right' never imagined by our Founders." Many faith leaders argue that the decision will "create" a restricted role for people of faith in American society, "stripping" all Americans of their freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. This, they believe, will "put" religious liberty at risk and lead to the "marginalization" of Americans who hold a biblical worldview. Christian leaders are calling on followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth," and some are already advocating for civil disobedience in response to the ruling.
