SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, warning of civil disobedience and restricted religious liberty. The court's ruling is seen as an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" that has "stripped all Americans of our freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process." Many believe the decision will "create a restricted role for people of faith in American society" and "put religious liberty at risk." Rev. Albert Mohler admonished followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth," while others, like Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience. The ruling is seen as a "defacto and legal catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview." Christian leaders are urging followers to respond with love and truth, while also warning of the dangers of this decision.
