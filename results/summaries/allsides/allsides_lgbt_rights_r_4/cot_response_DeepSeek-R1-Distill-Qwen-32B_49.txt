Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article and identify all the morally framed words. These are words that carry a strong emotional or ethical connotation. 

Looking at the text, words like "love," "concern," "warnings," "civil disobedience," "constitutional right," "unconstitutional," "tyranny," "invent," "imagined," "restricted," "liberty," "freedom," "democratic process," "pressing social issues," "biblical worldview," "marginalization," "disobedience," and "response" stand out as morally charged. 

Next, I'll summarize the article, making sure to include these words. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and reflect the moral concerns expressed by the Christian leaders. I'll focus on the key points: the Supreme Court's decision, the reactions from leaders like Huckabee and Vander Plaats, concerns about religious freedom, and the call for civil disobedience. I'll ensure that the moral framing is clear and that the summary accurately represents the article's tone and content.

**SUMMARY:**  
Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's historic decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, expressing love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience. The court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, overriding traditional marriage definitions in 14 states. Critics like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats argue the ruling is an unconstitutional act of judicial tyranny, inventing a new right not imagined by the Founders. Many leaders fear the decision will restrict religious liberty, stripping Americans of their freedom to debate marriage policy democratically. Rev. Albert Mohler urges Christians to speak the truth in love, emphasizing the importance of honesty about marriage. Organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom are preparing guidance for churches to protect their ministries. Some leaders, like Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience, while others study the ruling to determine the best response. The decision is seen as a catalyst for marginalizing those who embrace a biblical worldview. END OF SUMMARY.
