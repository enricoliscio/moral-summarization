SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing love, concern, and warnings about civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage. They view the ruling as an attack on traditional marriage and an act of judicial tyranny that infringes on religious liberty and the freedom to democratically debate and decide marriage policy. The ruling is seen as restricting the role of people of faith in American society and marginalizing those with a biblical worldview. Many leaders believe it puts religious liberty at risk and will lead to the marginalization of Americans who hold a biblical worldview. In response, some are calling for civil disobedience, while others are studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already provided guidance to churches and faith-based institutions to protect their religious freedoms. END OF SUMMARY.
