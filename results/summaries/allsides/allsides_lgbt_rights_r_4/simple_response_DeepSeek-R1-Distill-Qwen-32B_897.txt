Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article discusses the reactions of Christian leaders to the Supreme Court's decision allowing same-sex marriage nationwide. It mentions that 36 states and DC already allowed it, and now the remaining 14 must comply. Leaders like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats are criticizing the ruling as unconstitutional. They argue the court invented a new right not intended by the Founders.

The article also talks about concerns over religious liberty. Austin Nimocks and Jim Campbell from Alliance Defending Freedom are mentioned, saying the ruling strips Americans of the democratic process to decide marriage policy. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasizes speaking the truth in love about marriage. Southern Baptist Convention and Alliance Defending Freedom created a guide to help churches, and some leaders like Rev. Samuel Rodriguez see the ruling as marginalizing biblical worldview followers. Others, like Mat Staver, are calling for civil disobedience.

I need to capture these points concisely, focusing on the moral concerns and the leaders' responses. The summary should highlight the criticism of the ruling, the threat to religious freedom, and the calls for action, all within the moral framework presented.

I'll start by stating the Supreme Court's decision and the reactions. Then, mention the criticism as unconstitutional and the invented right. Next, address the impact on religious liberty and the democratic process. Include Mohler's advice on speaking truth and love. Mention the resources provided by the Southern Baptist Convention and the concerns about marginalization. Finally, note the calls for civil disobedience and other responses.

I should keep it under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is succinct. Also, I need to maintain the original moral perspective, showing the leaders' concerns and actions in response to the ruling.
