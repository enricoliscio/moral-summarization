Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Christian leaders' reactions to the Supreme Court's marriage ruling. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that Christian leaders are responding with love, concern, and warnings about civil disobedience. The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry nationwide. Before this, 36 states and D.C. allowed it, so now the remaining 14 states can't uphold traditional marriage definitions.

Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats are quoted, criticizing the ruling as unconstitutional. They argue the court invented a new right. The main concern is how this affects religious liberty. Austin Nimocks from the Alliance Defending Freedom is interviewed by CBN News. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasizes speaking the truth in love and not lying about marriage.

Many leaders believe this ruling will limit the role of people of faith in society. Jim Campbell from the Alliance says the court took away the democratic process for deciding marriage policy, which is a heart of liberty. The Southern Baptist Convention partnered with the Alliance to help churches protect their ministries, and Dr. Russell Moore was interviewed about this.

Rev. Samuel Rodriguez thinks the decision marginalizes those with a biblical worldview. Some leaders, like Mat Staver, are already calling for civil disobedience. Others are studying the ruling to decide how to respond.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: the court's ruling, the leaders' reactions, concerns about religious freedom, and the calls for action, including civil disobedience.

I'll start by stating the ruling and its impact. Then mention the leaders' criticisms. Highlight the concerns about religious liberty and the steps being taken, like the booklet and possible civil disobedience. Make sure to keep it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. Supreme Court's historic ruling affirming same-sex couples' constitutional right to marry nationwide has sparked strong reactions from Christian leaders. While 36 states and D.C. already recognized this right, the ruling now nullifies traditional marriage definitions in the remaining 14 states. Critics, including former governor Mike Huckabee and conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats, have condemned the decision as an overreach of judicial power. Many leaders worry about the impact on religious liberty, arguing that the ruling limits the democratic process and marginalizes those with biblical worldviews. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasized the need to speak truthfully about marriage while showing love. Organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom are providing guidance to churches, and some leaders, such as Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience. The ruling has sparked widespread concern among faith communities about their role in American society.  
END OF SUMMARY.
