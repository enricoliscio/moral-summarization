SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, with many expressing concerns about the impact on religious liberty. Some, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, have criticized the ruling as "judicial tyranny" and an overreach of the court's authority. Others, like Rev. Albert Mohler, are urging Christians to "speak the truth in love" and not compromise on their beliefs about marriage. Many leaders believe the ruling will lead to a restricted role for people of faith in American society and potentially put religious liberty at risk. Some, like Mat Staver, are even calling for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. The Alliance Defending Freedom has provided guidance for churches and faith-based institutions on how to protect their ministries in light of the ruling.
