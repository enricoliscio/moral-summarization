SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide with concerns about religious liberty and calls for civil disobedience. Many believe the ruling will restrict the role of people of faith in American society and put religious liberty at risk. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasized the importance of speaking the truth in love and love in truth, while others, like Mike Huckabee, condemned the decision as "unconstitutional judicial tyranny." The ruling is seen as a threat to democratic process and freedom of debate. Faith leaders, such as Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, warn that the decision will lead to the marginalization of Americans who hold a biblical worldview. Some, like Mat Staver, are already calling for civil disobedience, while others are studying the ruling to determine the best response. Overall, Christian leaders are framing the decision as a threat to religious freedom and the democratic process.
