SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing their love, concern, and warnings following the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. They view this decision as an infringement on their right to uphold traditional marriage and an act of tyranny by the judicial system. Many believe that the ruling will result in a restricted role for people of faith in American society and that it takes away their freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. Faith leaders are concerned about the impact of the ruling on religious liberty, believing that it puts their freedom to address social issues at risk. Some are calling for civil disobedience, while others are seeking guidance on how best to respond to this decision, which they believe marginalizes those with a biblical worldview. END OF SUMMARY.
