SUMMARY:
Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, warning of civil disobedience and tyranny. The ruling has sparked debate on religious liberty, with many leaders believing it will restrict the role of people of faith in American society. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasized the importance of speaking the truth in love, while others, like Mike Huckabee, condemned the decision as an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny." The ruling is seen as a threat to freedom and liberty, with some leaders, like Mat Staver, already calling for civil disobedience. Others are studying the ruling to determine the best ways to respond. The decision is feared to lead to the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview.
