SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide with warnings of civil disobedience and concerns about the impact on religious liberty. Many believe the ruling will restrict the role of people of faith in American society and put religious liberty at risk. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasized the importance of speaking the truth in love and love in truth, while others, like Mat Staver, are calling for civil disobedience. The ruling is seen as an attack on the democratic process and the freedom to debate and decide on social issues. Faith leaders are concerned that the decision will lead to the marginalization of Americans who hold a biblical worldview. The Alliance Defending Freedom and the Southern Baptist Convention have partnered to provide guidance for churches and faith-based institutions on how to respond to the ruling.
