SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing mixed reactions to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the United States, with some voicing concern over the impact on religious liberty. While some leaders, like Rev. Albert Mohler, emphasize speaking "the truth in love," others, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, view the ruling as judicial overreach. Many believe the decision will marginalize people of faith and restrict their role in society. Leaders such as Jim Campbell of the Alliance Defending Freedom argue that the democratic process has been undermined, and religious liberty is at risk. In response, some are calling for civil disobedience, while others are assessing the ruling to determine appropriate next steps. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already taken proactive measures, providing guidance to faith-based institutions on protecting their ministries. The overall sentiment among Christian leaders is that the ruling will have significant implications for the role of religion in American society.
