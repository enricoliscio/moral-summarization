SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing their deep concerns and pledging to respond with love and civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's landmark decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Many believe that this ruling is an attack on religious liberty and traditional values, with some, like Mike Huckabee, calling it "judicial tyranny." There are fears that people of faith will now have a restricted role in society and that their freedom to uphold traditional marriage and engage in democratic debates has been taken away. The ruling has prompted discussions on how best to protect religious liberty, with some calling for civil disobedience and others providing guidance to churches on how to navigate this new legal landscape. According to Rev. Albert Mohler, the Christian response must be rooted in love and truth, even as they disagree with the redefinition of marriage. The overall sentiment is one of dismay and a perceived erosion of moral values and religious freedom in America.
