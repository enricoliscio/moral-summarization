SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing their concerns and pledging to respond with love and civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage. The ruling, which grants same-sex couples the right to marry in all 50 states, has been deemed an "unconstitutional act of judicial tyranny" by some, including former governor Mike Huckabee. There are fears that the decision will restrict religious liberty and marginalize those with biblical worldviews. The president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Rev. Albert Mohler, urged followers to "speak the truth in love," emphasizing that lying about marriage is not an option for Christians. Many Christian leaders anticipate a restricted role for people of faith in American society and believe their freedom to engage in democratic debate on social issues has been compromised. Some, like Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, have called for civil disobedience, while others are evaluating the ruling to determine the most appropriate response. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already taken steps to guide and protect churches and faith-based institutions in the wake of this decision.

END OF SUMMARY.
