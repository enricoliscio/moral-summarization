SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing deep concerns about the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, warning of the threat it poses to religious liberty in America. The ruling, which grants same-sex couples the right to marry nationwide, has been deemed an act of "judicial tyranny" by some, including Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, who argue that it undermines the democratic process and imposes a new "right" never envisioned by the nation's founders. Religious leaders like Rev. Albert Mohler and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez fear that the decision will marginalize people of faith and restrict their role in society. They emphasize the need to speak the truth in love and are calling for civil disobedience, while also recognizing the importance of loving one's neighbor. Organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom and Liberty Counsel are providing guidance and resources to churches, asserting that the ruling undermines the freedom to democratically address pressing social issues. This ruling highlights a moral dilemma for many Christians, who must now navigate their commitment to their religious beliefs and the law of the land.
