Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. The user provided specific morally framed words that should be included in the summary.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry nationwide. Christian leaders are responding with concern, love, and some even talking about civil disobedience. They see this as a threat to religious liberty. Terms like "tyranny," "invent," "stripped," and "marginalization" are used to convey their disapproval.

I should start by identifying the main elements: the court's decision, the leaders' reactions, the use of specific moral words, and the impact on religious freedom. I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include as many of the listed moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

I'll begin by stating the court's decision and the leaders' responses. Then, mention the specific leaders and their concerns, using words like "tyranny" and "invent." I should highlight the fear of religious liberty being restricted and the call for civil disobedience. Including terms like "stripped" and "marginalization" will emphasize their perspective on the ruling's impact.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I have to be concise. I'll structure it in a few sentences, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral framing is maintained. Finally, I'll make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

SUMMARY: Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's historic decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, expressing concern, love, and warnings of civil disobedience. They argue the ruling is an "act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" and a "succumbing" to demands to "invent" a new constitutional right. Many fear the decision will "strip" Americans of the freedom to debate marriage policy democratically and "put" religious liberty at risk. Leaders warn of "marginalization" for those embracing a biblical worldview. Some, like Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience, while others, such as Rev. Albert Mohler, urge followers to "speak the truth in love" and "love in truth." The ruling is seen as a challenge to religious freedom, with organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention and Alliance Defending Freedom offering guidance to protect ministries. END OF SUMMARY.
