SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, warning of an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny." Many believe the ruling will lead to the "marginalization" of Americans who hold a biblical worldview. The court's decision has "stripped" all Americans of their freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process, creating a restricted role for people of faith in American society. Rev. Albert Mohler admonished followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth," emphasizing the importance of loving one's neighbor without lying about marriage. Others, like Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. The Alliance Defending Freedom has provided guidance for churches and faith-based institutions, warning that the ruling will put religious liberty at risk. Christian leaders are studying the ruling to determine the best ways to respond to this "act" that has "succumbed" to demands to "invent" a new constitutional right.
