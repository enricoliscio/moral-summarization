SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, with many expressing concerns about the impact on religious liberty. Some, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, have strongly criticized the ruling as "judicial tyranny" and an overreach of the court's authority. Others, like Rev. Albert Mohler, have emphasized the importance of speaking the truth in love and not lying about marriage. Many faith leaders believe the ruling will restrict the role of people of faith in American society and put religious liberty at risk. Some, like Mat Staver, have already called for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. The Alliance Defending Freedom has provided guidance for churches and faith-based institutions on how to respond to the ruling, and many are studying the decision to determine the best course of action.
