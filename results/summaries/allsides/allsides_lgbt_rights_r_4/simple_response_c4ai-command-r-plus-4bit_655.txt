SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing deep concerns over the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, fearing it will restrict religious liberty and marginalize those who uphold traditional biblical worldview. They view the ruling as an act of judicial tyranny, taking away the freedom to democratically debate and decide on marriage policy. Leaders such as Rev. Albert Mohler and Jim Campbell of the Alliance Defending Freedom emphasize the need to speak the truth in love while also warning of the challenges and restrictions the ruling may pose for people of faith in America. Some are even calling for civil disobedience as a response to protect their religious freedom. Dr. Russell Moore and the Southern Baptist Convention have partnered with the Alliance Defending Freedom to provide guidance and protection for churches and faith-based institutions in the wake of this decision. This ruling is seen as a turning point, with many faith leaders believing it will result in the marginalization of those with biblical worldviews and a restricted role for people of faith in American society.
