SUMMARY:
Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, warning of civil disobedience and tyranny. They believe the ruling strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process, putting religious liberty at risk. Many faith leaders, such as Rev. Albert Mohler, are admonishing followers to speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth, emphasizing that love of neighbor means not lying about marriage. Others, like Mat Staver, are calling for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. The decision is seen as a catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview.
