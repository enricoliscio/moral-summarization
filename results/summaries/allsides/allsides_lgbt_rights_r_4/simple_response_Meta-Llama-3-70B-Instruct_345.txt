SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding with concern and warnings of civil disobedience after the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Many see this ruling as an attack on religious liberty and the democratic process. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasizes the importance of speaking the truth in love, while others, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, condemn the ruling as "judicial tyranny" and an invention of a new constitutional right. Faith leaders believe this decision will restrict the role of people of faith in American society and put religious liberty at risk. Some, like Mat Staver, are already calling for civil disobedience in response. The ruling is seen as a threat to the freedom to debate and decide on social issues, which is essential to liberty. Christian leaders are urging followers to stand firm in their beliefs and to respond with love and truth.
