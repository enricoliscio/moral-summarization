SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing deep concern and calling for civil disobedience in response to the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, viewing it as an act of tyranny that strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide on marriage policy. They believe the ruling will marginalize people of faith and restrict their role in society. Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats strongly criticized the ruling as an unconstitutional and undemocratic act, with Huckabee calling it "judicial tyranny." Rev. Albert Mohler reminded followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth," emphasizing the importance of loving one's neighbor. The ruling has sparked fears among faith leaders that religious liberty will be at risk and that they will be put at a disadvantage in the American social landscape. Leaders such as Mat Staver have already advocated for civil disobedience, while others are carefully studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have also been actively engaged in providing guidance and resources to protect religious institutions. The overall sentiment among these Christian leaders is one of resistance and protection of their values, with a commitment to speaking the truth in love.
