SUMMARY:
In response to the Supreme Court's historic ruling on same-sex marriage, Christian leaders are choosing to react with love and concern, but also with warnings about the potential consequences for religious liberty and democracy. Many believe that the ruling is an act of "judicial tyranny," and that the court has invented a new "constitutional right" never intended by the Founders. There are warnings that religious liberty is at risk, and that people of faith will have a restricted role in American society. Leaders such as Jim Campbell of the Alliance Defending Freedom argue that the democratic process has been undermined, and that the freedom to debate and decide on marriage policy is at the heart of liberty. Rev. Albert Mohler admonishes Christians to "speak the truth in love," while also warning against lying about the nature of marriage. Some leaders, such as Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, are calling for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. Others are studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already provided guidance to churches and faith-based institutions, recognizing the potential challenges that lie ahead for those who hold a biblical worldview.
