SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding with concern and warnings of civil disobedience to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Many believe this ruling will restrict religious liberty and marginalize Americans who hold a biblical worldview. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasized the importance of speaking the truth in love, while others, like Mike Huckabee, condemned the ruling as "unconstitutional judicial tyranny." The Alliance Defending Freedom warned that the decision will strip Americans of their freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. Faith leaders are concerned that this ruling will lead to a restricted role for people of faith in American society. Some, like Mat Staver, are already calling for civil disobedience in response. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have provided guidance for churches and faith-based institutions to protect their ministries.
