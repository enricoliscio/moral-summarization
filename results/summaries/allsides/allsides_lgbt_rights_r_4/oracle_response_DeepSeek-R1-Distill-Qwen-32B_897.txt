Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the text and the specific words to keep. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They're expressing concern, love, and even talking about civil disobedience. The key morally framed words are act, tyranny, succumbed, invent, speak, love, create, stripped, put, marginalization.

I should make sure these words are included in the summary. I'll need to condense the information, focusing on the leaders' responses, their use of strong language, and their concerns about religious freedom.

First, mention the Supreme Court decision. Then, note the leaders' reactions, using words like "tyranny" and "invent." Highlight their call for love and truth. Then discuss the concerns about religious liberty being stripped and the fear of marginalization. Finally, mention the calls for civil disobedience and the preparation for response.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral word is appropriately placed without making the summary too long.

SUMMARY: Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's landmark decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, expressing concern and moral opposition. They describe the ruling as an "act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" and argue the court "invented" a new right not envisioned by the Founders. Many leaders emphasize the importance of "speaking the truth in love," urging adherence to biblical principles. They warn the decision will "strip" Americans of their democratic right to debate marriage policy and "create" a restricted role for people of faith in society. Some fear "marginalization" of those who embrace a biblical worldview. Leaders like Rev. Samuel Rodriguez and Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver call for "civil disobedience," while others prepare guidance to protect religious institutions. The ruling has sparked fears that religious liberty is being "put" at risk, with many studying the decision to determine the best response. END OF SUMMARY.
