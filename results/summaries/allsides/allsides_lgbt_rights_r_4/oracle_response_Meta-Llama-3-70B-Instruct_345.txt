SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, warning of civil disobedience and restricted religious liberty. The court's ruling is seen as an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" that has "stripped all Americans of our freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process." Many believe the decision will "create a restricted role for people of faith in American society" and "put religious liberty at risk." The ruling is viewed as a threat to traditional marriage, with some arguing that the court has "succumbed to demands to invent a new constitutional 'right' never imagined by our Founders." Christian leaders are calling for civil disobedience and urging followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth," as they believe the decision will lead to the "marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview."
