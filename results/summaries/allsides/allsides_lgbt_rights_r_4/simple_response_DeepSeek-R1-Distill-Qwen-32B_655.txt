Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They're expressing love, concern, and even talking about civil disobedience. The court ruled that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry nationwide, which was already allowed in 36 states and D.C. Now, the remaining 14 states can't uphold traditional marriage definitions anymore.

Some leaders, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, are criticizing the ruling as unconstitutional and tyrannical. They argue the court invented a new right not imagined by the Founders. Others, like Rev. Albert Mohler, emphasize speaking the truth in love and maintaining the definition of marriage. There's concern that religious liberty is at risk because the court took the decision away from democratic processes. Leaders worry that people of faith will have a restricted role in society.

The Southern Baptist Convention partnered with the Alliance Defending Freedom to provide guidance for churches, and some leaders are considering civil disobedience. The overall tone is that the ruling marginalizes those with a biblical worldview and threatens religious freedom.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words, keeping the moral perspective intact. I'll focus on the reactions, the criticism of the ruling, concerns about religious freedom, and the call for civil disobedience. I'll make sure to include key figures and their arguments without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: Start with the Supreme Court's decision, then mention the Christian leaders' reactions, their criticisms, concerns about religious liberty, and the call for civil disobedience. I'll also note the partnership for guidance and the marginalization concern.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and captures all the main points succinctly. Let me check the word count as I draft to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's landmark decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, expressing concern and warning of civil disobedience. The ruling, which extends marriage rights to same-sex couples in all 50 states, has sparked criticism from figures like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, who condemn it as unconstitutional judicial overreach. Leaders such as Rev. Albert Mohler emphasize the importance of speaking the truth in love while upholding traditional marriage definitions. There is widespread concern that the ruling undermines religious liberty, as it removes the democratic process from deciding marriage policy. Some, like Mat Staver, advocate for civil disobedience, while others, including the Southern Baptist Convention, are providing guidance to churches to navigate the new legal landscape. Many fear the decision marginalizes those with biblical worldviews, signaling a potential restriction on the role of faith in American society. END OF SUMMARY.
