SUMMARY:
Christian leaders are responding with love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. The ruling is seen as an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" that strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. Many faith leaders believe this decision will put religious liberty at risk, leading to the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview. Rev. Albert Mohler admonished followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth," emphasizing the importance of not lying about marriage. Others, like Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. The decision has sparked a heated debate about the role of people of faith in American society, with many believing it will lead to a restricted role. END OF SUMMARY.
