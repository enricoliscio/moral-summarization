Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me break this down. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a news article about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They want me to identify morally framed words and then write a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

Alright, starting with STEP 1: identifying morally framed words. I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "love," "concern," "warnings," "tyranny," "invent," "right," "freedom," "liberty," "truth," "lie," "marginalization," and "disobedience" come to mind. These words are used to convey the authors' moral stance on the issue.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article, making sure to include these morally charged words. The summary should reflect the concerns of Christian leaders about the ruling affecting religious freedom. I should mention key figures like Mike Huckabee, Bob Vander Plaats, Rev. Albert Mohler, and Jim Campbell, as well as organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom. I'll also note the call for civil disobedience and the booklet "Protecting Your Ministry."

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the reaction from Christian leaders, their concerns about religious liberty, the impact on democratic processes, and the call for action. I'll ensure that the moral framing is preserved by using the identified words appropriately.

Wait, did I miss any morally framed words? Let me double-check the article. "Out-of-control," "unconstitutional," "invent," "truth," "lie," "marginalization," "disobedience"â€”yes, those are all there. I think that's comprehensive.

Now, putting it all together, the summary should flow logically, starting with the Supreme Court decision, the leaders' reactions, their concerns, and the call for action. I'll make sure each sentence includes the morally framed words where appropriate without making it sound forced.

I think that's a solid approach. Time to write the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit. I'll start with the ruling, mention the leaders' responses, their arguments about the ruling's impact on religious freedom, and conclude with the call for civil disobedience and preparation for the future.

**STEP 1:**  
* love  
* concern  
* warnings  
* civil disobedience  
* unconstitutional  
* tyranny  
* invent  
* right  
* freedom  
* liberty  
* truth  
* lie  
* marginalization  

**SUMMARY:**  
Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, expressing love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience. They argue the ruling represents an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" and an invented "right" not envisioned by the Founders. Leaders like Rev. Albert Mohler emphasize speaking the truth in love, while others, such as Jim Campbell, warn that the decision strips Americans of their freedom to democratically debate marriage policy. Many fear the ruling will marginalize those with a biblical worldview and threaten religious liberty. Organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom are preparing resources to guide faith-based institutions. Some leaders, including Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience, signaling a growing divide over the court's decision. END OF SUMMARY.
