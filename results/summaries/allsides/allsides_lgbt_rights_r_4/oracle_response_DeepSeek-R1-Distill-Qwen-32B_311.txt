Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally charged words used by the author and include as many of them as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Christian leaders' reactions to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They're expressing concern, love, and even warnings about civil disobedience. The article mentions several leaders and their specific statements, highlighting their moral stance against the ruling.

I notice the author uses words like "act," "tyranny," "succumbed," "invent," "speak," "love," "create," "stripped," "put," and "marginalization." My task is to incorporate these words into the summary without losing the essence of the article.

I'll start by identifying the key points: the Supreme Court's decision, the reactions from leaders like Huckabee and Vander Plaats, the concern over religious liberty, and the call for civil disobedience. I need to weave these points together, using the moral words to convey the tone.

I should ensure that the summary is concise, no more than 200 words. I'll structure it to first state the decision, then the leaders' reactions, their concerns about religious freedom, and the call for action. 

I'll make sure to include each of the specified moral words where appropriate. For example, "act" can describe the court's decision, "tyranny" from Huckabee's statement, and "marginalization" from Rev. Rodriguez's point.

I'll also need to maintain the balance between summarizing the content and reflecting the moral framing. It's important to show the leaders' opposition and their fears about the impact on religious liberty, using words like "stripped" and "put at risk."

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and meets the word limit. I'll check that all the key points are covered and that the moral language is appropriately integrated.

SUMMARY:  
Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's historic decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, framing it as an "act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" and a "succumbing" to demands to "invent" a new constitutional "right." They warn of the ruling's impact on religious liberty, fearing it will "strip" Americans of their freedom to debate marriage policy democratically. Leaders like Rev. Albert Mohler emphasize the need to "speak the truth in love," while others, such as Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, call for civil disobedience. Many believe the decision will "create" a restricted role for people of faith and "put" religious liberty at risk, with some viewing it as a "catalyst for the marginalization" of those upholding biblical worldviews.
