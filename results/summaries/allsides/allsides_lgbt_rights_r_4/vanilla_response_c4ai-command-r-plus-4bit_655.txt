SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing concern and calling for civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's ruling that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry in all 50 states. Many believe that this decision will restrict religious liberty and marginalize those with biblical worldviews. Leaders such as Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats have criticized the ruling as judicial overreach, and some are warning of the impact on religious freedom. The Alliance Defending Freedom's Austin Nimocks and the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary's Rev. Albert Mohler have both spoken out, with Mohler urging Christians to "speak the truth in love." Faith leaders anticipate a restricted role for people of faith in American society and are concerned about the loss of freedom to democratically debate and decide on marriage policy. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already released guidance for churches and faith-based institutions to protect their religious liberty. Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver and other leaders have called for civil disobedience, while others are studying the ruling to determine the best course of action.
