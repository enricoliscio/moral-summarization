SUMMARY:
Christian leaders are expressing their love, concern, and warnings following the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. The ruling has sparked outrage among those who believe it infringes on religious liberty and freedom. Former governor Mike Huckabee called it "judicial tyranny," while Bob Vander Plaats accused the court of inventing a new "right." Rev. Albert Mohler urged Christians to "speak the truth in love," emphasizing that love of neighbor means not lying about marriage. Many leaders believe the decision will marginalize people of faith and restrict their freedom to engage in democratic debates on social issues, which is seen as the heart of liberty. The Southern Baptist Convention and Alliance Defending Freedom have already provided guidance to churches, anticipating the impact on religious liberty. Leaders like Mat Staver have called for civil disobedience, and others are studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. This decision has sparked strong moral and ethical responses, with many Christian leaders emphasizing their commitment to speaking the truth and defending their freedoms.
