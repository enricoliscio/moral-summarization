Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They're expressing concern, love, and even warnings about civil disobedience. The Court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry nationwide, which was already the case in 36 states. The remaining 14 states can't uphold traditional marriage definitions anymore.

Leaders like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats are criticizing the ruling, calling it unconstitutional and an invented right. They're worried about religious liberty. Austin Nimocks and others from Alliance Defending Freedom are concerned that the ruling takes away the democratic process for deciding marriage policy.

Rev. Albert Mohler is advising followers to speak the truth in love, emphasizing that love means not lying about marriage. There's a fear that religious freedom is at risk, with some leaders like Mat Staver calling for civil disobedience. The Southern Baptist Convention and Alliance Defending Freedom have resources to help churches navigate this.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral concerns about religious freedom and the impact on society. I should include key points like the Supreme Court decision, the leaders' reactions, their worries about religious liberty, and the call for civil disobedience.

Let me structure this: start with the decision, mention the leaders' reactions, their concerns about religious freedom, and the call for action. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and preserve the moral perspective.
