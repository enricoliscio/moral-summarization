Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They're expressing concern, love, and even warnings about civil disobedience. Some leaders are using strong language like "tyranny" and "invent a new right." They're worried about religious liberty being restricted.

I need to capture the key points: the court's decision, the reactions from leaders like Huckabee and Vander Plaats, the concern for religious freedom, and the call for civil disobedience. Also, the impact on society and the efforts to protect ministries.

I should structure the summary to include these elements, using the moral words provided. I'll start by stating the court's decision, then the reactions, the concerns about religious liberty, and the call to action. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me make sure I include words like "act," "tyranny," "invent," "love," "create," "stripped," "put," "marginalization." I'll weave these into the summary without making it sound forced.

I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the decision, moving to reactions, then the implications for religious liberty, and ending with the call for civil disobedience and the booklet's purpose.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it within the word limit and using the moral terms appropriately.

SUMMARY:  
The Supreme Court's historic decision affirming same-sex marriage rights nationwide has sparked strong reactions from Christian leaders, who express love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience. Critics like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats condemn the ruling as an "act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny," accusing the court of "inventing" a new right. Leaders worry the decision will "strip" Americans of their democratic freedom to debate marriage policy and "create" a restricted role for people of faith. Rev. Albert Mohler urges Christians to "speak the truth in love," emphasizing the importance of honesty about marriage. Many believe the ruling will "put" religious liberty at risk, with some, like Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, calling for civil disobedience. Others, such as the Southern Baptist Convention, are preparing resources to "protect" ministries from marginalization. The decision is seen as a catalyst for the "marginalization" of those with biblical worldviews. END OF SUMMARY.
