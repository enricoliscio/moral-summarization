SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing deep concern and calling for civil disobedience in response to the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, viewing it as an act of tyranny that strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide on marriage policy. They believe the ruling will result in the marginalization of people of faith and restrict their role in society. The ruling has also been criticized for inventing a new constitutional right never imagined by the Founders. Religious leaders emphasize the importance of speaking the truth in love and are seeking ways to protect religious liberty. According to Jim Campbell of the Alliance Defending Freedom, the ruling has "stripped all Americans of our freedom to democratically address the most pressing social issues." Leaders like Mat Staver have called for civil disobedience, while others are studying the ruling to determine appropriate responses. Rev. Samuel Rodriguez warns that the decision will legally catalyze the marginalization of those with a biblical worldview. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already taken steps to guide and protect churches and faith-based institutions.
END OF SUMMARY.
