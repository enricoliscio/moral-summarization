SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing deep concern and calling for civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage. The ruling has been deemed an "act of tyranny" by former governor Mike Huckabee, as it strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide on marriage policy through democracy. Many faith leaders believe that this ruling will result in the marginalization of people of faith and restrict their role in society. They argue that the court has succumbed to demands to invent a new constitutional right, never imagined by the Founders. Leaders such as Rev. Albert Mohler admonished followers to "speak the truth in love," emphasizing that love of neighbor means not lying about the true meaning of marriage. Some leaders, like Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, have already called for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. This ruling has sparked fears that religious liberty will be at risk, with organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom providing guidance to protect churches and faith-based institutions. The decision is seen as a catalyst for the marginalization of Americans with a biblical worldview.
