Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. The court ruled that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry everywhere in the U.S., overturning the remaining 14 states that didn't allow it before.

Some leaders are upset, calling the decision unconstitutional. Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats are mentioned, criticizing the court for creating a new right. Others, like Rev. Albert Mohler, are emphasizing speaking the truth in love but still concerned about the impact on religious freedom.

There's a focus on how this ruling affects religious liberty. Leaders like Jim Campbell argue that the court took away the democratic process for deciding marriage policy. Organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom are preparing resources to help churches and ministries navigate this change.

Some leaders, like Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, think this decision marginalizes those with a biblical worldview. Others, such as Mat Staver, are advocating for civil disobedience.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting the key reactions and concerns. I should mention the court's decision, the criticism from leaders, the concern over religious freedom, and the calls for action, including civil disobedience. I'll structure it to flow from the decision to the reactions and the implications.
