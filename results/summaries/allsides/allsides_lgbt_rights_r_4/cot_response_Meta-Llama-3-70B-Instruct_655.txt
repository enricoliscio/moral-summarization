SUMMARY:
Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Many view the ruling as an act of "unconstitutional judicial tyranny" that strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. Rev. Albert Mohler admonishes followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth," emphasizing that love of neighbor means not lying about marriage. Others, like Mat Staver, are calling for civil disobedience in response to the ruling, which they believe will lead to the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview. The decision is seen as a threat to religious liberty, with many faith leaders warning that it will create a restricted role for people of faith in American society. END OF SUMMARY.
