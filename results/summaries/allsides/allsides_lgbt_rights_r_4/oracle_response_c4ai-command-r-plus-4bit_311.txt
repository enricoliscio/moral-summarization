SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing deep concern and calling for civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, viewing it as an act of "judicial tyranny" that strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide on marriage policy. The ruling has widened the rift between those who hold traditional views of marriage and those who support same-sex marriage, with many faith leaders warning that religious liberty is now at risk. There are fears that people of faith will be marginalized and their role in society restricted. Leaders such as Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats have strongly criticized the ruling, with Huckabee calling it "unconstitutional judicial tyranny." Rev. Albert Mohler urged Christians to "speak the truth in love," emphasizing that love for our neighbors means not lying about marriage. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have provided guidance to churches, anticipating the potential impact on religious institutions. Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver and other leaders have advocated for civil disobedience, while others are studying the ruling to determine appropriate responses. This decision has sparked widespread discussion and concern among those who hold a biblical worldview, with many believing it will have significant implications for religious freedom in America.
