SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing love, concern, and a call to action in response to the Supreme Court's momentous decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. They argue that the ruling undermines religious liberty and restricts the role of people of faith in society. Some, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, see it as judicial overreach, with Huckabee calling it "unconstitutional judicial tyranny." Religious leaders are warning of the potential marginalization of those with biblical worldviews and are considering ways to respond, including civil disobedience. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already taken steps to guide and protect churches and faith-based institutions. Rev. Albert Mohler reminded Christians to "speak the truth in love," emphasizing that love for neighbors means not lying about the true nature of marriage. The ruling has sparked a debate about the balance between LGBT rights and religious freedom, with many Christians feeling their democratic rights have been stripped away.

END OF SUMMARY.
