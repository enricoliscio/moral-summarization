Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They're using strong moral language, like "tyranny" and "invent," to describe the ruling. Some leaders are warning about civil disobedience. The summary needs to include those specific words and keep the moral tone intact.

I should start by identifying the key points: the Supreme Court's decision, the reactions from Christian leaders, their concerns about religious liberty, and calls for action. I need to make sure each of these points is covered concisely.

I'll structure the summary by first mentioning the decision and the leaders' reactions. Then, I'll address the concerns about religious freedom and the potential for civil disobedience. I'll make sure to use the specified moral words where appropriate, like "tyranny," "invent," "stripped," and "marginalization."

I should also keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise but comprehensive. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included and the tone reflects the original article's framing.

SUMMARY: Christian leaders are reacting strongly to the Supreme Court's historic decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, framing it as an "act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" and a "demand to invent a new constitutional 'right' never imagined by our Founders." They warn of the ruling's impact on religious liberty, claiming it has "stripped" Americans of their freedom to debate marriage policy through democracy. Leaders like Rev. Albert Mohler urge followers to "speak the truth in love," emphasizing the importance of "love of neighbor" while opposing the ruling. Many believe the decision will "create" a restricted role for people of faith and "put" religious liberty at risk. Some, like Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience, while others are studying the ruling to determine the best response. The decision is seen as a "defacto and legal catalyst for the marginalization" of those with a biblical worldview. END OF SUMMARY.
