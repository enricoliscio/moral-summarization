Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article about Christian leaders' reactions to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

The article starts by saying that Christian leaders are responding with love, concern, and warnings about civil disobedience after the Supreme Court's decision. The Court ruled that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry nationwide. Previously, this was only the case in 36 states and DC, so now the remaining 14 states have to change their laws.

Some leaders are really upset. Mike Huckabee called the ruling "unconstitutional judicial tyranny." Bob Vander Plaats said the court invented a new right not imagined by the Founders. They're worried about religious liberty. The article mentions Austin Nimocks from the Alliance Defending Freedom, but I don't see his exact quote here. Then there's Rev. Albert Mohler, who tweeted about speaking truth in love and not lying about marriage.

Many Christian leaders believe this ruling will limit their role in society. Jim Campbell from Alliance Defending Freedom says the Court has taken away the freedom to debate marriage policy democratically. They see this as a threat to religious freedom. The Southern Baptist Convention worked with the Alliance to create a guide called "Protecting Your Ministry." Dr. Russell Moore was interviewed about this. Rev. Samuel Rodriguez thinks the decision marginalizes biblical worldview holders. Some, like Mat Staver, are calling for civil disobedience.

So, the summary needs to capture the main reactions: concern about religious freedom, the belief that the Court overstepped, the impact on societal debate, and calls for action like civil disobedience. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements.

I should start with the decision, then the leaders' reactions, their concerns about religious liberty, the impact on democracy, and the calls for action. Make sure to mention key figures like Huckabee, Vander Plaats, Mohler, Campbell, and Staver.

Let me structure this: Introduce the decision, then the leaders' concerns, their view on the impact on religious freedom and democracy, and the call for civil disobedience. Keep it clear and within the word limit.
