SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience in response to the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage. The ruling has been deemed an "unconstitutional judicial tyranny" by former governor Mike Huckabee, while Bob Vander Plaats believes the court "succumbed to demands" and "invented" a new constitutional right. Religious leaders are concerned about the impact of the ruling on religious liberty, with some believing it will marginalization people of faith and restrict their freedom to engage in democratic debate. Leaders such as Rev. Albert Mohler are admonishing followers to "speak the truth in love," while others are calling for civil disobedience. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have provided guidance to churches, and many leaders are studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. The Supreme Court's decision has sparked a moral debate and a call to protect religious freedom in the face of changing marriage laws.
