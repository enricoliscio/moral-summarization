Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Christian leaders' reactions to the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ruling. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry nationwide. Christian leaders are responding with concern, love, and some are even talking about civil disobedience. They see this as a threat to religious liberty. 

I should note the key figures mentioned: Mike Huckabee, Bob Vander Plaats, Austin Nimocks, Rev. Albert Mohler, Jim Campbell, Dr. Russell Moore, Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, and Mat Staver. Each of them has a specific stance or warning about the ruling. 

The main themes are the loss of traditional marriage definitions, the perception of judicial overreach, and the potential impact on religious freedom. Leaders are worried that their ability to express their beliefs about marriage will be restricted. Some are preparing for legal challenges or even civil disobedience.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the ruling and then mention the leaders' reactions, their concerns about religious liberty, and the calls for action. I'll make sure to include the moral perspective they're emphasizing, like the stripping of democratic process and the marginalization of biblical worldview adherents.

I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with the ruling, then the leaders' responses, their concerns, and the calls for action. Keeping it concise but covering all key points without losing the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide has sparked strong reactions from Christian leaders, who view the ruling as a threat to religious liberty and traditional values. Leaders like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats criticize the court for overstepping constitutional bounds, while others, such as Rev. Albert Mohler, emphasize the importance of speaking "truth in love" about marriage. Many believe the ruling restricts the democratic process and marginalizes those who uphold a biblical view of marriage. Some, like Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience, while organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention and Alliance Defending Freedom are preparing resources to guide churches and faith-based institutions. The ruling is seen as a catalyst for the marginalization of religious voices in American society. END OF SUMMARY.
