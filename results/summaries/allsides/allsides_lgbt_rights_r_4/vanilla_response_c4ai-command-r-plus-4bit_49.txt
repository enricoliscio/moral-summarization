SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing mixed reactions to the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, with some calling for love and concern, while others warn of civil disobedience. The ruling has sparked concerns about the impact on religious liberty, with many believing it will restrict the role of people of faith in society. The Alliance Defending Freedom's Austin Nimocks and Jim Campbell expressed disappointment, stating that the court's decision strips Americans of their freedom to debate and decide on marriage policy. Rev. Albert Mohler reminded Christians to speak the truth in love, while Rev. Samuel Rodriguez believes the ruling will marginalize those with a biblical worldview. Some leaders, like Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, have called for civil disobedience, while others are studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom have already released guidance for churches and faith-based institutions to protect their religious liberty in the wake of the ruling.
