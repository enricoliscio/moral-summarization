SUMMARY: Christian leaders have expressed concern, love, and warnings of civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's landmark decision on same-sex marriage. The ruling grants same-sex couples the right to marry in all 50 states, overturning the traditional marriage definitions upheld by 14 states. Notable figures like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats have criticized the decision as judicial overreach. Religious liberty is seen as being at risk, with many faith leaders believing the ruling will restrict the role of people of faith in society. The Southern Baptist Convention and Alliance Defending Freedom have provided guidance to churches, and many Christian leaders are calling for civil disobedience or studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. Rev. Albert Mohler reminded followers that speaking the truth in love is essential. The ruling has sparked debate over the balance between religious liberty and same-sex marriage rights, with some believing it infringes on democratic freedoms.
