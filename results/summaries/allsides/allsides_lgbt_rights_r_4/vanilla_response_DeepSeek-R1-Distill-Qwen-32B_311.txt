Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Christian leaders' reactions to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article mentions that the Supreme Court ruled same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry nationwide. Before this, 36 states and DC allowed it, so now the remaining 14 states must comply. Christian leaders are responding with a mix of emotions and actions.

Some leaders are using strong language, like Mike Huckabee calling it "unconstitutional judicial tyranny." Others, like Bob Vander Plaats, criticize the court for creating a new right not intended by the Founders. They're worried about religious liberty.

Austin Nimocks from the Alliance Defending Freedom is interviewed, and Rev. Albert Mohler emphasizes speaking the truth in love. Many leaders believe this ruling will limit the role of people of faith in society. They feel the democratic process has been taken away, as the court decided the issue.

The Southern Baptist Convention partnered with the Alliance to provide guidance for churches, called "Protecting Your Ministry." Dr. Russell Moore and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez are mentioned, with Rodriguez saying the decision marginalizes those with a biblical worldview.

Some leaders, like Mat Staver, are calling for civil disobedience. Others are studying the ruling to figure out the best responses.

So, the key points are: Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, Christian leaders' concerns about religious freedom, criticism of the court's decision, and calls for action, including civil disobedience.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main reactions and concerns. Make sure to mention the ruling, the leaders' worries, their quotes, and the actions they're taking or considering.

I should structure it to first state the ruling, then the leaders' reactions, their concerns about religious liberty, and the calls for civil disobedience or other actions. Keep it concise and clear.

Let me draft that.
