SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide with warnings of civil disobedience and concerns about the impact on religious liberty. Many believe the ruling will restrict the role of people of faith in American society and put religious liberty at risk. Rev. Albert Mohler emphasized the importance of speaking the truth in love and love in truth, while others, like Mike Huckabee, condemned the decision as "judicial tyranny." The ruling is seen as a threat to democratic process and freedom of debate. Faith leaders are preparing for a potential backlash, with some calling for civil disobedience and others studying the ruling to determine the best response. The decision is viewed as a catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who hold a biblical worldview. Christian leaders are urging followers to stand firm in their beliefs while navigating the new legal landscape.
