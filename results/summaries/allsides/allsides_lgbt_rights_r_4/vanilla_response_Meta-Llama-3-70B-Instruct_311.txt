SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, with many expressing concern for religious liberty. Some, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, have strongly condemned the ruling as "judicial tyranny" and an overreach of the court's authority. Others, like Rev. Albert Mohler, are urging Christians to speak the truth in love and to defend traditional marriage. Many faith leaders believe the ruling will lead to a restricted role for people of faith in American society and put religious liberty at risk. Some, like Mat Staver, are even calling for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. The Alliance Defending Freedom has provided guidance for churches and faith-based institutions on how to respond to the ruling, and many are studying the decision to determine the best course of action.
