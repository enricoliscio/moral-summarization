SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide with concern and warnings of civil disobedience. Many believe the ruling will restrict the role of people of faith in American society and put religious liberty at risk. Former governor Mike Huckabee and conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats have spoken out against the decision, calling it "unconstitutional judicial tyranny" and an invention of a new constitutional right. Rev. Albert Mohler and other faith leaders are urging Christians to speak the truth in love and to defend traditional marriage. The Alliance Defending Freedom has provided guidance for churches and faith-based institutions, and some leaders are calling for civil disobedience in response to the ruling. The decision is seen as a threat to religious freedom and the democratic process.
