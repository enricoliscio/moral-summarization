Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the reactions from Christian leaders.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is legal nationwide. Christian leaders are reacting with concern, love, and some are warning of civil disobedience. They feel their religious liberties are at risk. Leaders like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats are criticizing the ruling as unconstitutional. Others, like Rev. Albert Mohler, emphasize speaking the truth in love. Jim Campbell from Alliance Defending Freedom mentions the loss of democratic process in deciding marriage policy. The Southern Baptist Convention has resources to help churches navigate this, and some leaders are calling for civil disobedience.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral concerns. I'll structure it to first mention the court's decision, then the leaders' reactions, their concerns about religious freedom, and the call for civil disobedience. I'll keep the tone aligned with the original article's framing, highlighting their belief that the ruling marginalizes biblical worldview holders.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to summarizing the given information accurately. Also, I'll ensure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and covers all key points without going into too much detail. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. 

After drafting, I'll review to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the moral perspective presented in the article.

SUMMARY: Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's landmark decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, expressing concerns about religious freedom and the impact on traditional marriage. Some, like former governor Mike Huckabee and conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats, criticize the ruling as unconstitutional judicial overreach. Others, such as Rev. Albert Mohler, urge Christians to "speak the truth in love" while adhering to biblical principles. Leaders worry the ruling will restrict their role in society and limit democratic debate on marriage policy. Jim Campbell of the Alliance Defending Freedom warns that the decision strips Americans of their freedom to address social issues through democratic processes. The Southern Baptist Convention has partnered with the Alliance Defending Freedom to provide guidance for churches, while some leaders, like Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, have called for civil disobedience. Many believe the ruling will marginalize those who embrace a biblical worldview. END OF SUMMARY.
