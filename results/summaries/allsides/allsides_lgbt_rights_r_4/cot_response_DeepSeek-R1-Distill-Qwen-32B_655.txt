Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Christian leaders reacting to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. They're using terms like "love," "concern," "warnings," and "civil disobedience." 

First, I'll identify all the morally framed words. Words like "love," "concern," "warnings," "civil disobedience," "tyranny," "invent," "right," "liberty," "freedom," "democratic process," "truth," "neighbor," "lie," "challenge," "biblical," "marginalization," and "catalyst." These words carry strong moral connotations.

Now, for the summary, I need to include these terms as much as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the Supreme Court's decision and the reactions from Christian leaders. I'll mention their concerns about religious freedom and the potential impact on society. I'll include the quotes from Huckabee and Vander Plaats to show their opposition. Then, I'll note the advice from Rev. Mohler and the steps taken by organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention. Finally, I'll mention the calls for civil disobedience and the overall tension between marriage rights and religious freedom.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points without being too lengthy. Let me check the word count as I go. I think I can cover all the necessary points within the limit. Alright, I'll draft the summary now, making sure to incorporate the moral terms identified earlier.

**Summary:**
The Supreme Court's decision affirming same-sex marriage rights nationwide has sparked strong reactions from Christian leaders, who express love and concern while warning of civil disobedience. Critics, like Mike Huckabee and Bob Vander Plaats, condemn the ruling as unconstitutional tyranny, arguing it invents a new right contrary to Founders' intentions. Leaders such as Rev. Albert Mohler urge followers to speak the truth in love, emphasizing the importance of honesty about marriage. Many fear the ruling will restrict religious freedom, stripping Americans of the democratic process to decide marriage policy. Organizations like the Southern Baptist Convention are preparing guidance to protect ministries, while others, including Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, call for civil disobedience. The decision is seen as a catalyst for marginalizing those with biblical worldviews, highlighting the tension between marriage rights and religious liberty. END OF SUMMARY.
