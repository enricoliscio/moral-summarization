SUMMARY: Christian leaders are expressing their love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience following the Supreme Court's historic decision on same-sex marriage. The Court's ruling has been deemed an act of "tyranny," with concerns raised about the invention of a new "right" never imagined by the Founders. The freedom to democratically address pressing social issues and decide marriage policy is at the heart of liberty, and many believe this ruling restricts the role of people of faith in American society. Religious liberty is perceived to be at risk, with some faith leaders advocating for civil disobedience. The challenge for Christians, as Rev. Albert Mohler points out, is to speak the truth in love and to not lie about the love of their neighbors regarding marriage. Leaders such as Jim Campbell of the Alliance Defending Freedom and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez warn that the ruling will marginalize Americans who hold a biblical worldview. Others are studying the ruling to determine the best course of action. END OF SUMMARY.
