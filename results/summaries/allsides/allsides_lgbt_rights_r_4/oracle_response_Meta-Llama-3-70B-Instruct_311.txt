SUMMARY:

Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision to grant same-sex couples a constitutional right to marry. Many see this as an "out-of-control act of unconstitutional judicial tyranny" that "succumbed to demands to invent a new constitutional 'right' never imagined by our Founders." The ruling is viewed as a threat to religious liberty, with Rev. Albert Mohler urging followers to "speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth." Christian leaders believe the decision will "create a restricted role for people of faith in American society" and "strip all Americans of our freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process." Some, like Mat Staver, are even calling for civil disobedience in response. The decision is seen as a "defacto and legal catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview." Overall, Christian leaders are warning that this ruling will "put religious liberty at risk" and are urging followers to respond with love and truth.
