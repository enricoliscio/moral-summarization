Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify all the morally charged words. Words like "love," "concern," "warnings," "civil disobedience," "unconstitutional," "tyranny," "invent," "right," "truth," "liberty," "freedom," "democratic," "strip," "marginalization," and "biblical" stand out as having strong moral connotations. 

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes these words. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and capture the main points: Christian leaders' reactions, their concerns about religious freedom, and the call for civil disobedience. I'll make sure to include the key players and their statements, highlighting the moral arguments they're making against the court's decision.

I should structure the summary to first mention the Supreme Court's ruling, then the leaders' responses, their concerns about religious liberty, and the call for action. I'll ensure that the morally framed words are included to reflect the original article's tone and arguments. 

Let me check the word count as I draft to make sure it stays within the limit. I'll also make sure the summary flows logically, connecting each point smoothly. Once done, I'll review it to ensure all important elements are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**
Christian leaders are reacting to the Supreme Court's landmark decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, expressing love, concern, and warnings of civil disobedience. They argue the ruling is an unconstitutional act of judicial tyranny, stripping Americans of their freedom to debate marriage policy democratically. Leaders like Rev. Albert Mohler emphasize the need to speak the truth in love, while others, such as Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver, call for civil disobedience. Many fear the ruling will marginalize those with a biblical worldview and restrict religious liberty, urging faith-based institutions to protect their ministries. The decision is seen as a catalyst for limiting the role of people of faith in society, with concerns about the heart of liberty being eroded. END OF SUMMARY.
