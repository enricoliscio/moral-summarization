SUMMARY:
Christian leaders are responding with love and concern to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, warning of civil disobedience and tyranny. They argue that the ruling is an unconstitutional act that invents a new constitutional right, restricting religious liberty and freedom to debate and decide marriage policy through the democratic process. Many faith leaders believe the ruling will put religious liberty at risk, leading to the marginalization of Americans who embrace a biblical worldview. They are calling for Christians to speak the truth in love and to speak love in truth, while others are studying the ruling to determine the best ways to respond, including civil disobedience. The decision serves as a catalyst for the marginalization of Americans who hold a biblical worldview. END OF SUMMARY.
