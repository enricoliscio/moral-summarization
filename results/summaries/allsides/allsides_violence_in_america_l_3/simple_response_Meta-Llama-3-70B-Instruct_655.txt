SUMMARY:

The city of Chicago has ended one of its most violent years in history, with 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents compared to 2015. The staggering statistics have put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the spike in violence to the flood of illegal guns, anger towards police, and a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system. He notes that gang members consider the court system "a joke" and are emboldened to commit violent crimes. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, including adding 1,000 officers to the police department and implementing new initiatives. However, critics argue that police have become more reluctant to do their jobs due to fear of being scrutinized and becoming the next "viral video."
