Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Chicago's violent crime statistics. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that Chicago had its most violent year in history, with 762 homicides, the highest in two decades. That's more than New York and LA combined. The number of shooting incidents also increased by 1,100 compared to 2015. This has made Chicago a focal point in the national conversation about gun violence.

The police department's data shows a significant spike in homicides since 2015, which had 485 cases. This is the largest increase in 60 years. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson mentioned the influx of illegal guns into the city, with 8,300 illegal guns recovered in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year. He also pointed out that gang members feel emboldened due to public anger at the police, especially after the Laquan McDonald shooting incident. The video of the shooting led to protests and a loss of trust in the police force.

The majority of the violence occurred in five police districts on the South and West sides, which are poorer and predominantly black areas with active gangs. Most victims had prior gang ties or arrests, indicating targeted violence. Mayor Rahm Emanuel added 1,000 officers, and the police are implementing new initiatives like street cameras and gunshot detection systems to reduce crime.

Johnson also mentioned that gang members see the justice system as ineffective, with minor offenders spending more time in jail than gun offenders. The police have become more cautious, partly due to fear of being captured in viral videos, leading to fewer stops and arrests. This perception among criminals has allowed more violent crimes to occur without fear of consequences.

So, the key points are: record-high homicides, increase in shootings, illegal guns, impact of police scrutiny, targeted gang violence in specific areas, and efforts to address the issue. I need to condense these points into a concise summary under 200 words.
