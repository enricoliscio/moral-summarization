SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in violent crimes in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. The city's police department has attributed the rise in violence to various factors, including the availability of illegal guns, a lack of deterrence for gun crimes, and the impact of the highly publicized shooting of Laquan McDonald by a police officer. Superintendent Eddie Johnson also suggested that anger towards the police and a perception of a weakened police force have emboldened criminals. The majority of the crimes occurred in predominantly black, impoverished areas where gang activity is prevalent. The city has responded by adding more officers and implementing new initiatives to combat the violence. Johnson acknowledged the challenges faced by his department and the need to rebuild trust with the community. The release of the McDonald shooting video and the subsequent fallout have also been cited as contributing factors to the increase in crime.
