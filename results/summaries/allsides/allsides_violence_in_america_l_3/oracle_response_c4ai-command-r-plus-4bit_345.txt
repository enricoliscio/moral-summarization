SUMMARY: Chicago ended 2016 with a staggering number of homicides: 762 people were victims of deadly shootings, making it the most violent year in two decades. This toll surpasses the combined death tolls of New York and Los Angeles. The increase in homicides, up from 485 in 2015, represents the largest surge in 60 years. The city also witnessed an additional 1,100 shooting incidents last year compared to 2015.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the rise in violence to several factors, including the flood of illegal guns into the city and a lack of deterrence for gun crimes. He also pointed to the impact of the highly publicized shooting of Laquan McDonald by a police officer, which resulted in increased scrutiny and criticism of the police force. Johnson believes this has emboldened criminals and made them less fearful of the criminal justice system.

The majority of the shootings and deaths occurred in just five of the city's 22 police districts, predominantly poor and black areas where gangs are most active. Police data showed that over 80% of the victims had been previously identified as being more susceptible due to gang ties or past arrests. 

The city is now grappling with how to address this surge in violence, with plans to add 1,000 officers to the police department and implement other initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems.
