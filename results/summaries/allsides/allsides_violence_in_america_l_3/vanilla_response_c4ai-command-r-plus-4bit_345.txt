SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in violent crime in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, the highest in two decades. The increase in homicides is the largest spike in 60 years, and the city's police department recovered 20% more illegal guns compared to 2015. Chicago's police superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the rise in violence to a lack of deterrence for gun crimes and the emboldening of criminals due to anger towards police. The majority of the violence occurred in five predominantly black and poor districts on the South and West sides, where gang activity is prevalent. The city has responded by adding 1,000 officers to the police force and implementing new initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. Johnson also cited the release of a video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager as a factor in the increased violence, as it has led to a perceived weakening of the police force and a drop in arrests. Critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs, allowing gangs to operate with impunity.
