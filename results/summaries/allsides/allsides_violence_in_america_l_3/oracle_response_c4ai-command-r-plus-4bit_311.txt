SUMMARY: Chicago has experienced one of its most violent years in history, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents in 2016. This represents a sharp increase in violence compared to the previous year, with 1,100 more shooting incidents and 277 more homicides. The bulk of these crimes occurred in five predominately black and impoverished police districts on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The surge in violence has prompted a range of responses from city officials, including plans to add 1,000 officers to the police department and implement more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. 

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the increase in violence to a range of factors, including the release of video footage of a controversial police shooting, the perception of a weakened police force, and Illinois' lax gun laws. Johnson also pointed to the criminal justice system as a contributing factor, noting that criminals often face little consequence for their actions. 

The city's efforts to curb the violence have been met with mixed reactions, with some critics arguing that officers have become more reluctant to engage in proactive policing due to increased scrutiny and fear of becoming the next "viral video." The challenges faced by the Chicago Police Department highlight the complex nature of addressing urban violence and the need for comprehensive solutions that go beyond law enforcement.
