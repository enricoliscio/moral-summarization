SUMMARY: 

The city of Chicago experienced one of its most violent years in history, with 762 homicides in 2016, the most in two decades. This represents a significant increase from 2015, when 485 homicides were reported. Additionally, there were 1,100 more shooting incidents in 2016 compared to the previous year. Police officials attribute the surge in violence to the proliferation of illegal guns, with 8,300 recovered in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year. They also point to a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system, with gang members feeling emboldened to commit violent crimes. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in five police districts on the city's South and West sides, predominantly black and poor areas where gangs are most active. The city has implemented various initiatives to address the violence, including the addition of 1,000 officers to the police department and the expansion of gunshot-detection systems.
