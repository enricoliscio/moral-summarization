SUMMARY: Chicago has seen a sharp increase in violent crime, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents in 2016, the most in two decades. The surge in violence has been attributed to various factors, including the flood of illegal guns, a weakened police force, and a lack of deterrence for gun crimes. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson laments the lax gun laws and the emboldening of criminals due to anger towards police. The bulk of the violence occurs in predominantly black, poor areas where gangs are most active, with over 80% of victims having gang ties or past arrests. Chicago's efforts to address the violence include adding 1,000 officers and implementing new initiatives, but the city continues to struggle with the surge in homicides and shootings. The release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video and the resulting fallout have also played a role in the declining public trust in the police force and increased caution among officers. Johnson acknowledges the challenges but remains committed to fighting crime aggressively, despite criticism that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs. The complex interplay between gang activity, gun availability, and police-community relations underscores the need for comprehensive solutions to address Chicago's violent crime wave. END OF SUMMARY.
