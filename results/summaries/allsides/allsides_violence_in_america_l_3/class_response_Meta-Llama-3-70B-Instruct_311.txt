SUMMARY:

The city of Chicago has witnessed one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents in 2016 compared to 2015. The statistics reveal a story of bloodshed and violence, with police recovering 8,300 illegal guns, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the surge in violence to the flood of illegal guns, anger at police, and a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system. He claims that criminals feel emboldened to commit violent crimes, including attacks on police, due to the perceived lack of consequences. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives such as adding 1,000 officers to the police department and expanding gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that officers have become more cautious and reluctant to do their jobs, leading to a decrease in arrests and an increase in nefarious activity.
