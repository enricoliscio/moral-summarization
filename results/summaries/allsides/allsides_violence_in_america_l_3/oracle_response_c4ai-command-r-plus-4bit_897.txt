SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in homicides and shootings in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, the most in two decades. The increase has sparked a national dialogue about gun violence and has left the city scrambling for solutions. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the rise in violence to several factors, including the flood of illegal guns into the city, anger at police, and a weakened criminal justice system that fails to deter criminals. The bulk of the violent crimes occurred in five predominantly black and poor police districts on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. 

Despite efforts to address the bloodshed, such as adding 1,000 officers to the police department and implementing new technologies, the city has struggled to curb the rising death toll. Johnson believes that the release of a video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times, has also played a role in the surge, emboldening criminals and making officers more cautious in their duties. The result, some critics argue, is a pullback in police presence, allowing gangs to act with impunity. As Chicago grapples with the devastating impact of this violence, officials continue to search for effective solutions to stem the tide of shootings and homicides.
END OF SUMMARY.
