Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. Chicago had a record number of homicides and shootings in 2016. The police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, mentioned the influx of illegal guns and the lack of deterrents. There's also the impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting and subsequent protests affecting police morale and actions.

I should highlight the moral issues like the surge in violence, the failure of the justice system, and the impact on marginalized communities. I'll need to use words like homicides, bloodshed, violence, shootings, crime, emboldened, deterrent, etc.

I'll structure the summary to first state the record numbers, then mention the reasons (illegal guns, lack of deterrent), the effect of the McDonald case on police, and the concentrated areas affected. I'll end with the city's efforts to combat the issue.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine related points and avoid unnecessary details. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Also, make sure to use the morally framed words naturally within the summary.

SUMMARY:  
In 2016, Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in bloodshed, driven by illegal guns, has sparked national concern over gun violence. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted a 20% increase in illegal gun recoveries and criticized the lack of deterrents, citing that offenders face minimal consequences. The violence, concentrated in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, has been emboldened by public distrust in law enforcement, particularly after the Laquan McDonald shooting protests. Critics argue that police have become more reluctant to act, fearing scrutiny and viral videos. Johnson acknowledged officers' caution and linked it to a state law requiring extensive paperwork for stops, which has reduced arrests. Criminals exploit this perceived weakness, committing nefarious activities with impunity. The city has responded with initiatives like street cameras and gunshot-detection systems, but the crisis persists, highlighting systemic failures in addressing violence and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
