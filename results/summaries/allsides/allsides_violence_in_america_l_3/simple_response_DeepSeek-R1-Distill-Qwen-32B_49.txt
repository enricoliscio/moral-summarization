Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Chicago's homicide rates. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. 

The article mentions that Chicago had 762 homicides in 2016, the highest in two decades, more than New York and LA combined. There's a significant increase in shootings and illegal guns. The police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, points out issues with gun laws and the deterrent effect. He also talks about the impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting video on police behavior and public trust. 

I need to capture the moral issues here: the surge in violence, the role of illegal guns, the effect of police scrutiny on their actions, and the community impact. I should structure the summary to highlight these points succinctly, making sure to mention the spike in numbers, the factors contributing to it, and the consequences on the community and police morale. 

I should also keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise, preserving the author's framing about the moral implications of the situation. Let me put it all together, ensuring each key point is covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY:  
Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades in 2016, with 762 homicides—more than New York and Los Angeles combined—and 3,550 shooting incidents, a 46% increase from 2015. The surge in gun violence, particularly in poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods, has sparked national concern. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the rise to a flood of illegal guns, lax gun laws, and a lack of deterrents, as offenders face minimal consequences. The video of the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald by a white officer in 2015 emboldened criminals, who perceive the justice system as ineffective. Johnson also noted that police have become more cautious, fearing scrutiny and viral videos, leading to fewer stops and arrests. Critics argue this reluctance has allowed gang violence to escalate, with most victims being gang-affiliated. The city has introduced measures like street cameras and gunshot-detection systems to curb violence, but the crisis persists, highlighting systemic issues in law enforcement and justice.  
END OF SUMMARY.
