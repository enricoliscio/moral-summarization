Okay, so the user wants me to summarize this news article about Chicago's homicide rates. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that Chicago had 762 homicides in 2016, which is the highest in two decades and more than New York and LA combined. That's a big number, so I should highlight that. It also mentions an increase in shooting incidents by 1,100 compared to 2015. Police data shows a lot of illegal guns, with an 8,300 recovery in 2016, up 20% from the previous year. Superintendent Johnson points out that Chicago has a problem with illegal guns and that the criminal justice system isn't deterring people from using them because the penalties are too low.

The article also talks about the areas affectedâ€”mostly the South and West sides, which are poorer and predominantly black, with high gang activity. Most victims had prior gang ties or arrests. The city's response includes adding 1,000 officers and new surveillance measures. Johnson mentions that the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video in 2015 might have emboldened criminals, leading to increased violence. There's also a state law requiring more paperwork for police stops, which has resulted in fewer stops.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main statistics, the causes (illegal guns, weak deterrents), the affected areas, and the city's response. Also, mention the impact of the McDonald video and the state law on police actions. I'll structure it to cover these points succinctly, ensuring it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY:  
Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The city saw a 57% increase in homicides and a 46% rise in illegal gun recoveries compared to 2015. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge to a flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrents, as offenders face minimal consequences. Most violence occurred in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods with active gang activity. The city added 1,000 officers and implemented new surveillance measures to combat the rise. Johnson also linked the surge to the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video, which emboldened criminals and led to fewer arrests due to cautious policing. END OF SUMMARY.
