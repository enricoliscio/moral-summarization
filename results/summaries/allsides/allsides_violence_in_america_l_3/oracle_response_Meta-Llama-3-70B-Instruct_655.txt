SUMMARY: Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, surpassing the combined total of New York and Los Angeles. The city also saw a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered, with 8,300 seized. The bloodshed has left a trail of death and violence, with a 60-year high in homicide spikes. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the surge to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling emboldened to commit violent crimes due to lax gun laws and a perceived weakness in the criminal justice system. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that police have become reluctant to do their jobs, fearing becoming the next "viral video." The result is a culture of fear, where criminals feel they have little to fear from the law. END OF SUMMARY.
