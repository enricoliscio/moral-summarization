SUMMARY:

The city of Chicago has ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The surge in violence has been attributed to a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system, with criminals feeling "emboldened" to commit violent crimes due to lax gun laws and a perceived lack of accountability. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor and predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has lamented the flood of illegal guns and the lack of trust in the police force, which has led to a decline in arrests and a sense of impunity among criminals. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems, but the moral fabric of the city remains torn.
