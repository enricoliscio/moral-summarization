SUMMARY: The year 2016 saw a sharp increase in homicides and shooting incidents in Chicago, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, a staggering number that has put the city at the center of a national dialogue on gun violence. The increase in violence has been attributed to various factors, including the lax gun laws in Illinois, a perceived lack of deterrence for gun crimes, and the release of a video showing a white police officer fatally shooting a black teenager. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson has expressed concern that criminals have become emboldened and view the criminal justice system as a joke. The bulk of the violence has occurred in five predominantly black and poor police districts on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Despite efforts to address the violence, such as adding more officers and implementing new technologies, the city has struggled to curb the rising tide of bloodshed. Johnson believes that officers have become more cautious in their duties due to increased scrutiny and fear of becoming the next "viral video." The city's efforts to restore public trust and address the gun violence epidemic will continue into 2017.
