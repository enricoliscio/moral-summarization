SUMMARY:

Chicago ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The city's police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, attributes the surge in violence to a lack of deterrents, with criminals feeling emboldened due to lax gun laws and a perceived weakness in the criminal justice system. The majority of the violence occurred in five police districts on the city's South and West sides, predominantly black and poor areas where gangs are most active. Johnson believes that the release of a video showing a white police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times has contributed to the increase in violence, with criminals taking advantage of a perceived pullback by police. The city has implemented initiatives to address the violence, including adding 1,000 officers and expanding gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that police have become more reluctant to do their jobs, fearing becoming the next "viral video."
