Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should include as many as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about Chicago's record-high homicides in 2016, which was the most in two decades. They had 762 homicides, more than New York and LA combined. There were also a lot more shooting incidents compared to 2015. The main issues are illegal guns, police challenges, and the impact on certain neighborhoods.

I need to highlight the moral aspects like violence, bloodshed, fear, etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the record homicides, the spike, and the areas affected. Then, talk about the causes: illegal guns, police challenges, the impact of the Laquan McDonald case, and the resulting emboldened criminals. Finally, mention the city's efforts to address the issue.

I should make sure to use words like homicides, violence, bloodshed, fear, emboldened, etc., from the author's list. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the problem, then the causes, and ending with the response.

Let me draft that. Make sure each sentence includes the moral framing words where appropriate. Also, keep it under 200 words. I'll check the word count after writing to ensure compliance.

SUMMARY:  
In 2016, Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades, with 762 homicides—more than New York and Los Angeles combined—and 3,550 shooting incidents, a staggering surge from 2015. The city's South and West sides, predominantly poor and black neighborhoods, bore the brunt of the bloodshed, with 80% of victims linked to gangs or prior arrests. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the spike to a flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrents, noting that criminals face minimal consequences, emboldening them to commit violent crimes. The release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video in 2015, which sparked widespread anger and protests, has left officers more cautious, fearing scrutiny and viral backlash. This reluctance, combined with Illinois' lax gun laws, has allowed gang violence to flourish. Mayor Rahm Emanuel added 1,000 officers, and new initiatives like street cameras and gunshot detection aim to curb the surge in violence. However, critics argue that the police's reluctance to act has created an environment where gangs can kill with impunity, highlighting the deep challenges in addressing Chicago's epidemic of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
