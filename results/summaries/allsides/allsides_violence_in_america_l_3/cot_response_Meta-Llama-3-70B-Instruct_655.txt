SUMMARY:
The city of Chicago has ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. This sobering tally has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The increase in homicides is the largest spike in 60 years, with police and city officials lamenting the flood of illegal guns into the city. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the surge in violence to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling emboldened to commit crimes due to lax gun laws and a perceived weakness in the criminal justice system. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor and predominantly black areas on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems aimed at driving down the violent crime rate. END OF SUMMARY.
