SUMMARY: Chicago ended one of its most violent years on record, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents in 2016. This surge in violence has brought the city into the national dialogue about gun violence. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into Chicago and the lack of deterrence for gun crimes. Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the increase in violence to several factors, including anger at police and a weakened criminal justice system. He also noted that gang members consider the court system a joke and that criminals feel emboldened to commit crimes without fear of consequences. The majority of the violence occurred in five predominantly black and poor police districts where gangs are most active. Johnson hopes that initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems will help drive down the violent crime rate. The release of video footage of a police shooting of a black teenager and the subsequent fallout have also contributed to the perception of a weakened police force and a decrease in arrests. Critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs, allowing gang violence to flourish. Johnson acknowledges that officers are more cautious due to fear of becoming the next "viral video."
