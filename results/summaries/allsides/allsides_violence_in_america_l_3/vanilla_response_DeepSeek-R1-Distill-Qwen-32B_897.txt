Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Chicago's homicide rates. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by stating that Chicago had its most violent year in history, with 762 homicides, the highest in two decades. That's more than New York and LA combined. They also had 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015. The increase from 485 in 2015 is the largest spike in 60 years. That's a big jump.

The police blame the influx of illegal guns. They recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, a 20% increase. Superintendent Eddie Johnson mentions that Chicago isn't alone in this spike, and that anger at police, especially after the Laquan McDonald shooting, has emboldened criminals. He thinks the criminal justice system isn't deterring them because the penalties for gun offenses are too light compared to other crimes.

The homicides are concentrated in five police districts on the South and West sides, which are poor and predominantly black. Most victims had gang ties or past arrests. The city added 1,000 officers and is using more cameras and gunshot detection systems. Johnson points to several factors, including the release of the McDonald video, which led to protests and a drop in arrests. Critics say officers are more cautious, leading to less proactive policing.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: record homicides, causes like illegal guns and police scrutiny, concentration in certain areas, and the city's response. I'll make sure to mention the impact of the McDonald case and the deterrent issue.

SUMMARY:  
Chicago experienced its most violent year in decades in 2016, with 762 homicidesâ€”the highest in 20 years and surpassing the combined totals of New York and Los Angeles. The city also saw a 1,100% increase in shooting incidents compared to 2015. Police attribute the surge to an influx of illegal guns, recovering 8,300 such weapons in 2016, a 20% rise from the previous year. Superintendent Eddie Johnson linked the violence to a lack of deterrents, as penalties for gun offenses are perceived as too lenient. Most homicides occurred in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods on the South and West sides, where gang activity is prevalent. Victims often had prior gang ties or arrests. The city has responded by adding 1,000 officers and implementing measures like street cameras and gunshot detection systems. However, critics argue that police have become more cautious since the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video, leading to fewer arrests and emboldening criminals. Johnson acknowledged that officers are deterred by the risk of viral scrutiny, further complicating efforts to curb violence. END OF SUMMARY.
