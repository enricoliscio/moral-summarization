SUMMARY: Chicago saw a staggering spike in homicides and shootings in 2016, ending the year with one of the most violent years in its history. The surge in violent crime has left police and city officials lamenting the flood of illegal guns and the lack of a deterrent to curb gun violence. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the increase in part to lax gun laws and a weakened police force, as officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs for fear of becoming the next "viral video". He also pointed to the emboldened nature of criminals who see an opportunity to commit nefarious activity without fear of consequences. The bulk of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in just five of the city's predominantly black and poor police districts, where gangs are most active. Despite efforts to address the violence, such as adding more officers and expanding gunshot-detection systems, the city has struggled to curb the rising tide of bloodshed. Johnson and other officials have decried the lax gun laws and the invasive scrutiny of police conduct, which they believe has contributed to the surge in violent crime by emboldening criminals and weakening the force's ability to effectively fight crime. Chicago's violent year has sparked a national dialogue about gun violence and the complex interplay between law enforcement and community trust. END OF SUMMARY.
