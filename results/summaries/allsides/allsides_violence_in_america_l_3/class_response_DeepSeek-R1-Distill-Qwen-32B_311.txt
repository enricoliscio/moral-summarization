Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so the summary should highlight the ethical and moral aspects as the author presented them.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Chicago's record-high homicides and shootings in 2016, which is the most violent year in two decades. The city saw 762 homicides and over 3,550 shooting incidents, which is a significant increase from 2015. The moral framing here is evident through words like "homicides," "bloodshed," "violence," and "crime."

The article mentions the influx of illegal guns and the police's struggles with the criminal justice system. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson points out that the deterrent against using guns is weak because minor offenders spend more time in jail than gun offenders. This highlights a moral issue with the justice system's priorities.

The surge in violence is linked to the release of the Laquan McDonald video, which led to public distrust in the police. This has emboldened criminals, as they see the police as less of a threat. The moral framing here includes "emboldened" and "nefarious activity," showing how societal events impact crime rates.

The affected areas are predominantly poor and black, with most victims having gang ties. This points to systemic issues and moral concerns about inequality and justice.

The city's response includes adding police and new technologies, but there's criticism about reduced arrests due to cautious officers. The moral aspect here is about the effectiveness of law enforcement and public trust.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary, using as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll start by stating the record-high numbers, then discuss the causes like illegal guns and weak deterrents. I'll mention the impact of the McDonald video on police trust and criminal emboldenment. Finally, I'll touch on the city's response and the ongoing challenges.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting each point while maintaining the moral perspective. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and concise, making sure to include terms like "homicides," "violence," "crime," "emboldened," and "deterrent."

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the problem, explain the causes, discuss the consequences of police actions, and conclude with the city's efforts and remaining issues. This way, the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

SUMMARY:  
In 2016, Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades, with 762 homicides and over 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in bloodshed, driven by illegal guns and a weak deterrent against gun violence, has raised national concern. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted that criminals feel emboldened, as the justice system often punishes minor offenses more harshly than gun crimes. The spike in violence coincided with the release of a viral video showing a police officer shooting a black teenager, which eroded public trust in law enforcement and led to fewer arrests. Most deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, where victims were often tied to gangs. The city has responded with new initiatives, including more police and surveillance, but critics argue that hesitant officers and reduced stops have allowed nefarious activity to flourish. The moral failings of the justice system and societal distrust have contributed to Chicago's epidemic of violence.  
END OF SUMMARY.
