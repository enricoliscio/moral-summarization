SUMMARY: Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, has ended one of the most violent years in its history with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades. The city saw a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered, with 8,300 seized in 2016. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling "emboldened" to commit crimes due to lax gun laws and a perceived weakness in the criminal justice system. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Johnson noted that the release of a video showing a white police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times may have contributed to the increase in violence. The city has scrambled to address the bloodshed, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems aimed at driving down the violent crime rate. END OF SUMMARY.
