SUMMARY:

Chicago has ended one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015. The city's police department attributes the surge in violence to the flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system. According to Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, criminals feel "emboldened" to commit violent crimes due to a perceived lack of consequences. The majority of the deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives such as adding 1,000 officers to the police department and expanding gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs due to fear of being scrutinized and becoming the next "viral video." The city's struggle with gun violence has sparked a national dialogue, with Johnson lamenting that "in Chicago, we just don't have a deterrent to pick up a gun."
