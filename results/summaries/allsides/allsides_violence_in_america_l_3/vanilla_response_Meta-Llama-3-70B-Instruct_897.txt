SUMMARY:

Chicago ended 2016 with a record 762 homicides, the most in two decades, surpassing the combined total of New York and Los Angeles. The city also saw a 20% increase in illegal gun recoveries and a 57% spike in shooting incidents. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to a lack of deterrents, with criminals feeling emboldened due to lax gun laws and a perceived weakness in the criminal justice system. The majority of the violence occurred in five predominantly black and poor police districts on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has responded by adding 1,000 officers and implementing initiatives such as street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. Johnson also acknowledged that officers have become more cautious due to fear of being featured in "viral videos" and increased paperwork requirements.

END OF SUMMARY.
