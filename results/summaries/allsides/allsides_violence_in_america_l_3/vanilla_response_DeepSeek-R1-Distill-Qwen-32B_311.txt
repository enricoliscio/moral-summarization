Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chicago's homicide rates. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by stating that Chicago had 762 homicides in 2016, the highest in two decades. That's more than New York and LA combined. The city also saw 1,100 more shooting incidents compared to 2015. The police department released this data, highlighting the city's struggle with gun violence.

The article mentions that the increase in homicides from 485 in 2015 is the largest spike in 60 years. Police blame the influx of illegal guns, having recovered 8,300 in 2016, a 20% increase. Superintendent Eddie Johnson points out that Chicago has a problem with deterrence because minor offenders spend more time in jail than gun offenders. He also notes that gang members see the court system as a joke.

Most of the violence is concentrated in five police districts on the South and West sides, which are poor and predominantly black. Victims often have gang ties or past arrests. Mayor Emanuel added 1,000 officers, and new initiatives like cameras and gunshot detection are being tried.

Johnson attributes the surge in violence to factors like the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video, which led to protests and a drop in arrests. Critics believe officers are more hesitant to act after the video. The state law requiring contact cards has also led to fewer stops.

I need to condense all this into a 200-word summary. I'll focus on the key points: homicide numbers, causes like illegal guns and lack of deterrence, concentration in certain areas, police initiatives, and the impact of the McDonald video on police behavior.

Let me structure it: start with the homicide stats, mention the reasons (illegal guns, lack of deterrence), note the affected areas, describe police actions, and end with the impact of the video on police caution.

I should ensure it's concise, under 200 words, and flows logically. Let me check each paragraph for essential info and trim unnecessary details. Make sure to include Superintendent Johnson's points and the initiatives. Also, mention the areas affected and the demographics.

I think that covers the main points without going into too much detail. Time to put it all together.

SUMMARY:  
Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades in 2016, with 762 homicides—more than New York and Los Angeles combined—and 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted a lack of deterrence, as minor offenders often spend more time in jail than gun offenders. Most violence occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, with victims often tied to gangs or past arrests. Mayor Rahm Emanuel added 1,000 officers, and new initiatives like cameras and gunshot detection aim to curb crime.
