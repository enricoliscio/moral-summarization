SUMMARY: Chicago ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The city saw a 60-year high in homicide spikes, with 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015. The bloodshed has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to a flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system, emboldening criminals to commit nefarious activity. He also cited anger at police, following the release of a video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, as a contributing factor. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black areas with high gang activity. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. END OF SUMMARY.
