Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The key points are the high number of homicides, the spike in shootings, the impact on the community, police challenges, and the factors contributing to the violence. I'll structure the summary to highlight the severity, the causes, and the efforts to address the issue, using the specified words to maintain the moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
In 2016, Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in bloodshed, driven by a flood of illegal guns, has sparked national concern about gun violence. Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns, a 20% increase from 2015, as gang activity flourished in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods on the South and West sides. Over 80% of victims had prior gang ties or arrests, indicating targeted violence.  

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson linked the surge to anger at police, emboldening criminals, and a lack of deterrent against gun crime. He criticized Illinois' lax gun laws and noted that criminals view the justice system as a "joke." The city added 1,000 officers and implemented initiatives like street cameras and gunshot-detection systems to curb violence. However, critics argue that police reluctance to act, influenced by the Laquan McDonald shooting scandal, has allowed gangs to operate freely.  

The moral framing highlights the devastating impact of violence, fear, and a failing justice system, with criminals exploiting public distrust and police caution. END OF SUMMARY.
