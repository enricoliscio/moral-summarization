SUMMARY:
The city of Chicago has witnessed one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades. The increase in homicides is the largest spike in 60 years, with a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the surge in violence to the "emboldened" criminals who feel they have little to fear from the criminal justice system. He also points to the "anger" towards police, particularly after the release of a video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager 16 times. Johnson notes that gang members consider the court system a "joke" and that the price for being caught is small compared to other large cities. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor and predominantly black areas where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. END OF SUMMARY.
