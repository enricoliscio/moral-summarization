Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chicago's violent crime statistics. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Chicago having a record number of homicides and shootings in 2016. It mentions the city's third-largest status and compares it to other cities. There's a focus on the increase in illegal guns and the impact of police shootings on gang activity. The moral framing seems to highlight issues like lack of deterrents, police reluctance, and systemic problems leading to violence.

I should start by noting the record high numbers. Then, mention the causes like illegal guns and the aftermath of the Laquan McDonald shooting. It's important to include how the police's caution and changes in law have affected their ability to enforce, leading to emboldened criminals. Also, the areas affected are predominantly poor and black, which adds a moral dimension regarding systemic issues.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Make sure to include the Superintendent's quotes about the lack of deterrent and the perception of the justice system. Also, mention the initiatives to reduce crime, but note the challenges they face.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to first present the statistics, then the causes, and finally the responses and underlying issues. This should capture the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY:  
Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in violence, particularly in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, has been linked to an influx of illegal guns and a lack of deterrents. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted that gang members perceive the criminal justice system as ineffective, emboldening them to commit violent crimes. The city also saw a 20% increase in illegal gun recoveries, highlighting the challenges posed by lax gun laws. The fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald in 2015 and its aftermath have further complicated efforts to restore public trust in law enforcement, with officers becoming more cautious and reluctant to act. Critics argue that this reluctance has allowed gangs to operate with impunity. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has announced plans to increase police presence and implement new surveillance measures, but systemic issues, including the perception of injustice and the impact of viral police videos, continue to fuel the cycle of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
