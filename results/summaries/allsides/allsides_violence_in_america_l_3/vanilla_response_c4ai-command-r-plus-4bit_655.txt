SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in gun violence in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, the highest in two decades. The increase has been attributed to various factors, including the availability of illegal guns, a weakened police force due to public scrutiny, and a lack of deterrence for gun crimes. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson expressed concern about the criminal justice system's leniency towards gun offenders and the emboldening of criminals due to anger towards police. The violence was concentrated in five predominantly black and poor districts on the South and West sides of the city, where gang activity is prevalent. The city has responded by adding more officers and implementing new initiatives to curb the rising crime rate. Johnson also cited the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video as a factor in the increased violence, as it led to a decline in public trust and a pullback in policing. Critics argue that officers have become reluctant to do their jobs due to fear of scrutiny. The statistics highlight the urgent need to address gun violence and the complex issues contributing to it.
