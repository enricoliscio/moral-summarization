SUMMARY: Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, has witnessed one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents in 2016 compared to the previous year. The city's bloodshed has put it at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The increase in homicides is the largest spike in 60 years, with police recovering 8,300 illegal guns, a 20% increase from the previous year. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the surge in violence to the flood of illegal guns and the perception among criminals that they have little to fear from the criminal justice system. He notes that gang members consider the court system "a joke" and are emboldened to commit violent crimes. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that officers have become reluctant to do their jobs, leading to a drop in arrests and allowing gangs to "kill each other." END OF SUMMARY.
