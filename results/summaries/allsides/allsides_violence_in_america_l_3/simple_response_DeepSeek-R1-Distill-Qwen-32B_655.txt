Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chicago's violence in 2016. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article starts by stating that Chicago had 762 homicides in 2016, the highest in two decades. That's a key point. It also mentions more shootings than New York and LA combined. So, the city is in the midst of a violent crime spike.

Next, the article talks about the increase in illegal guns. Police recovered 8,300 illegal guns, a 20% increase. Superintendent Johnson mentions the flood of illegal guns and the lack of deterrents. He compares the punishment for stealing bread to gun offenses, which is a moral point about justice and deterrence.

The article also discusses the impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting video. This event led to protests and a loss of public trust in the police. It seems like this incident emboldened criminals, as they saw that the police were being scrutinized, making them less afraid to commit crimes. This ties into the moral framing of how police actions affect crime rates and public safety.

Additionally, the surge in violence is concentrated in poor, predominantly black areas with active gangs. The victims are often tied to gangs or have past arrests, which highlights systemic issues and the cycle of violence.

Mayor Emanuel's response was to add 1,000 officers, but the police are also struggling with new state laws that require more paperwork, leading to fewer stops. This is another moral angle about how policies can inadvertently affect crime rates.

Johnson mentions that criminals watch the media and exploit the situation, which is a point about the public's perception influencing criminal behavior.

So, in the summary, I need to include the record homicides, the rise in illegal guns, the impact of the McDonald shooting on police and crime, the concentration of violence in certain areas, and the challenges in addressing the issue. I should keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral aspects are clear.

I should structure it by first stating the record, then the causes (illegal guns, lack of deterrents), the effect of the police shooting video, the concentration in specific neighborhoods, and the challenges faced by the police department. I'll need to make sure each point is concise and flows logically.

SUMMARY: Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in illegal guns, with police recovering 8,300 in 2016, a 20% increase, was cited as a key factor. Superintendent Eddie Johnson highlighted the lack of deterrents, noting that minor offenders often face harsher penalties than gun criminals. The violence was concentrated in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, with victims often tied to gangs or prior arrests. The fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald in 2015 and its aftermath, including protests and federal investigations, were seen as emboldening criminals, as they perceived a weakened police force and public distrust. Mayor Rahm Emanuel added 1,000 officers, but critics argue that officers have become more cautious, fearing scrutiny and viral videos. The city also faces challenges from state laws requiring extensive paperwork for stops, reducing police activity. Johnson emphasized that criminals exploit these dynamics, leading to a dangerous cycle of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
