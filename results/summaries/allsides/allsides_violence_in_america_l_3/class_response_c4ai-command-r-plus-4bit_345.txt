SUMMARY: Chicago's violent year ended with a staggering tally of 762 homicides, more than New York and Los Angeles combined. The city also witnessed a surge in shooting incidents, with 1,100 more cases in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in homicides and shootings has put Chicago at the center of national discussions about gun violence. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the rise in attacks to the flood of illegal guns, a weakened criminal justice system, and anger towards police. He lamented the lack of deterrence for gun crimes, with criminals showing little fear of consequences. The bulk of the crimes occurred in five predominantly black and poor districts, where gangs are most active. Victims were often linked to gangs or had prior arrests. Efforts to curb the violence include adding 1,000 officers and implementing new technologies. Johnson cited the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video as a factor, leading to a decline in arrests and increased caution among officers. The city faces a challenging task in restoring public trust and reducing the violent crime rate.
