SUMMARY:

The city of Chicago has ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The surge in violence has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the spike in crime to the flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling "emboldened" to commit violent crimes. Johnson also points to anger at police, particularly in the wake of the Laquan McDonald shooting, as a contributing factor. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that police have become more cautious, leading to a decline in arrests. The situation has left many feeling that the criminal justice system is a "joke" and that criminals have little to fear.
