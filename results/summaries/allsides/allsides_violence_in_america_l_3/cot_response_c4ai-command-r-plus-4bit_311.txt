SUMMARY:
Chicago saw a surge in violent crime in 2016, with a staggering 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents. This spike in violence has been attributed to various factors, including a weakened police force, gang activity, and lax gun laws. The bulk of these crimes occurred in predominantly black and poor areas on the city's South and West sides, where gang activity is prevalent. 

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lamented the flood of illegal guns into Chicago, blaming it on Illinois' lax gun laws. He also pointed to the criminal justice system as a joke, with criminals spending less time in jail for gun crimes than for minor offenses. Johnson believes that criminals have become emboldened to commit violent crimes due to their perception of a weakened police force that is reluctant to engage due to fears of virality and increased scrutiny. 

The police department has responded by adding 1,000 officers and implementing new initiatives, such as more street cameras and gunshot detection systems. However, critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs, allowing gangs to arm themselves and engage in nefarious activity without fear of repercussions. 

The increase in violence has left Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence and the complex relationship between police and the communities they serve.
