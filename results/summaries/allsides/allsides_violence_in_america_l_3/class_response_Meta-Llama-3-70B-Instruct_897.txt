SUMMARY:

Chicago has ended one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades. The city saw a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police, contributing to the bloodshed. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the spike in violence to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling emboldened to commit crimes due to lax gun laws and a perceived lack of consequences. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Johnson noted that gang members consider the court system "a joke" and that the price for being caught is small compared to other large cities. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that police have become more reluctant to do their jobs, leading to a surge in nefarious activity.
