Alright, so the user has provided a detailed news article about the surge in violence in Chicago and wants a summary that preserves the moral framing. They also mentioned I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. First, I need to understand the key points of the article.

The article talks about the record number of homicides and shootings in Chicago, attributing the increase to illegal guns and a lack of deterrents. It mentions the impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting video on public trust and police behavior. The moral framing here is about systemic issues like gun laws, police accountability, and the consequences of these factors on violence rates.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I should highlight the statistics, the reasons behind the surge, and the moral implications. It's important to mention the role of illegal guns, the police's challenges, and the community's distrust. Also, the comparison to other cities and the specific neighborhoods affected adds context.

I'll start by stating the record number of homicides and shootings. Then, explain the factors contributing to the surge, like illegal guns and the impact of the McDonald shooting. I should include Superintendent Johnson's points about the lack of deterrents and the effect on police behavior. Finally, mention the city's efforts to combat the violence and the underlying issues that need addressing.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting too bogged down in details. Keeping it concise while preserving the moral aspects is crucial. I'll make sure to end with the ongoing efforts and the need for systemic changes, tying back to the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in violence, particularly in poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods, has been linked to a flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrents. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson highlighted the emboldening of criminals, partly due to public anger over police actions, such as the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, which sparked widespread protests and eroded trust in law enforcement. The video of McDonald's killing, released in 2015, led to a dramatic drop in arrests and a perception that criminals face little consequence. Johnson emphasized that gang members view the justice system as "a joke," with minor offenders facing longer pre-trial detention than gun offenders. The city's efforts to combat violence, including adding 1,000 officers and installing street cameras, aim to curb the surge. However, systemic issues, such as Illinois' lax gun laws and the impact of police accountability on officer behavior, remain unresolved, contributing to the cycle of violence. END OF SUMMARY.
