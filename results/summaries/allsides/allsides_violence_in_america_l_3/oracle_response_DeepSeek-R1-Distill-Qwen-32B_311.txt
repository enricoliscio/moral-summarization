Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants me to use as many of the listed morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Chicago's record-high homicides in 2016, with 762 deaths, the highest in two decades. It's more than New York and LA combined. There's a significant increase in shooting incidents too. The police link this to a flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrent. They mention that gang activity is concentrated in poor, predominantly black areas. There's also the impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting video, which affected public trust and police morale. The police superintendent talks about how criminals feel emboldened because the consequences are light.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words: homicides, shooting, bloodshed, violence, shootings, death, flood, attacks, anger, emboldened, crimes, fear, deterrent, stealing, deaths, surged, expansion, arrests, drive, shot, drop, seizures, fighting, crime, reluctant, killed, charged, kill, stops, activity.

I should structure the summary to include these words. Start with the alarming statistics, then the causes (illegal guns, lack of deterrent), mention the affected areas, the impact of the McDonald shooting, and the police's efforts. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft it: Chicago had record homicides and shootings in 2016, linked to illegal guns and lack of deterrent. Poor, black areas with gangs saw most violence. Police Superintendent mentions criminals emboldened due to light consequences. The Laquan McDonald shooting video affected trust and police stops. Efforts to reduce crime include more cameras and detection systems. The moral framing words are integrated to highlight the severity and causes.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes as many of the specified words as possible without making it sound forced. Let me check the word count and adjust if necessary.

SUMMARY:  
Chicago experienced one of its most violent years in history in 2016, with 762 homicidesâ€”the highest in two decades and surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The city also saw a staggering 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015. Police linked the surge in bloodshed to a flood of illegal guns, recovering 8,300 in 2016, a 20% increase. The violence, concentrated in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, was fueled by gang activity. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted that criminals feel emboldened due to the low risk of facing consequences, with gang members dismissing the justice system as "a joke." The release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video, which showed a police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, further strained trust in law enforcement and led to a drop in arrests. Johnson emphasized the need for deterrents, as offenders often face minimal punishment. Despite efforts like adding cameras and gunshot-detection systems, the city grapples with a perception that criminals have little to fear, driving the surge in violence. END OF SUMMARY.
