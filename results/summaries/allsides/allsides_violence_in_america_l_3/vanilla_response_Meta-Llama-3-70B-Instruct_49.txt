SUMMARY:

Chicago ended 2016 with a record 762 homicides, the most in two decades, surpassing the combined total of New York and Los Angeles. The city also saw a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling emboldened due to lax gun laws and a perceived weakness in the criminal justice system. The majority of the deaths and shootings occurred in five predominantly black and poor police districts on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has responded by adding 1,000 officers and implementing initiatives such as street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. Johnson also acknowledged that officers have become more cautious, partly due to fear of becoming the next "viral video," which may have contributed to the surge in violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
