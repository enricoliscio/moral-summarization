SUMMARY: Chicago has experienced one of its most violent years on record, with 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents in 2016 compared to the previous year. This surge in bloodshed has brought the city into the national spotlight, with the number of homicides being the largest spike in 60 years. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the increase in crime to a lack of deterrence for gun offenders and the emboldening of criminals due to anger at police. The bulk of the shootings and deaths occurred in five predominantly black and poor areas on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. 

Police have recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year, and Johnson has complained about Illinois' lax gun laws. The release of video footage showing a white officer shooting a black teenager 16 times has also been cited as a factor, with the perception of a weakened police force and a dramatic drop in arrests. Johnson hopes that initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems will help drive down the violent crime rate in Chicago. 

The city has also scrambled to address the violence, with Mayor Rahm Emanuel announcing the addition of 1,000 officers to the police department. However, critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs, and the focus on gun violence over minor drug arrests may be a contributing factor to the rising murder rate. 

END OF SUMMARY.
