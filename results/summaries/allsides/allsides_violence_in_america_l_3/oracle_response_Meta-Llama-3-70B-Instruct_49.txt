SUMMARY:

Chicago ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, surpassing the combined total of New York and Los Angeles. The city saw a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered, with 8,300 seized, and a 60-year high in the spike of homicides. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to the flood of illegal guns and the perception among criminals that they have little to fear from the criminal justice system. He noted that gang members consider the court system "a joke" and that the price for being caught is small compared to other large cities. The majority of deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that officers have become reluctant to do their jobs, leading to a drop in arrests and emboldening criminals to commit nefarious activity.
