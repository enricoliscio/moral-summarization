Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Chicago's record-high homicides in 2016. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by stating that Chicago had 762 homicides in 2016, the highest in two decades and more than New York and LA combined. That's a striking number. It also mentions that shooting incidents increased by 1,100 compared to 2015. So, the city is dealing with a significant surge in violence.

The police attribute this spike to an influx of illegal guns. They recovered 8,300 illegal guns in 2016, which is a 20% increase. Superintendent Eddie Johnson points out that Chicago's gun laws are lax, making it easier for gang members to arm themselves without facing severe consequences. He also mentions that criminals feel emboldened, perhaps due to public sentiment after the Laquan McDonald shooting, which led to protests and a drop in public trust in the police.

The violence is concentrated in five police districts on the South and West sides, which are poor and predominantly black areas. Most victims had gang ties or prior arrests, indicating that the violence isn't random but rather targeted.

The city's response includes adding 1,000 officers and implementing new technologies like street cameras and gunshot detection systems. However, some critics argue that police have become more cautious, leading to fewer arrests and allowing gangs to operate more freely.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should highlight the key points: the record number of homicides, the increase in shootings, the role of illegal guns, the impact of the Laquan McDonald case on police trust, the concentration of violence in specific areas, and the city's efforts to address the issue.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the statistics, then the causes, the affected areas, and the responses. I'll also need to mention the Superintendent's comments on gun laws and the perception among criminals that the justice system is lenient.

Let me structure it step by step. First, the homicide and shooting stats. Then, the causes: illegal guns, police's challenges, and the impact of the McDonald case. Next, where the violence is happening. Finally, the city's measures to combat it and the critics' views.

I should avoid going into too much detail on each point to keep it concise. Also, ensure that the summary doesn't exceed the word limit. Let me draft it now, keeping each sentence focused on one main point.

SUMMARY: Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in violence was attributed to an influx of illegal guns, with police recovering 8,300 illegal firearmsâ€”a 20% increase from the previous year. Superintendent Eddie Johnson highlighted the emboldening effect on criminals following the Laquan McDonald shooting and subsequent protests, which eroded public trust in the police. Most violence occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, targeting individuals with gang ties or prior arrests. The city responded by adding 1,000 officers and implementing technologies like street cameras and gunshot detection systems. Critics, however, argue that police have become more cautious, leading to fewer arrests and allowing gangs to thrive. END OF SUMMARY.
