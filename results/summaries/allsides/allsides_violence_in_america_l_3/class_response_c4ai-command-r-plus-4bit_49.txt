SUMMARY: Chicago saw a staggering increase in violent crime in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, the most in two decades. The surge in bloodshed has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, recovering 8,300 in 2016, a 20% increase. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the rise in violence to a lack of deterrence for gun crimes and anger towards police, leaving criminals emboldened. The bulk of the crimes occurred in five predominantly black and poor areas on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has promised to add 1,000 officers to the police department, while Johnson hopes that increased surveillance and gunshot detection will help drive down the violent crime rate. Critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs due to increased scrutiny and public distrust following high-profile incidents such as the Laquan McDonald shooting. Johnson acknowledged the challenges but emphasized that his officers are aggressively fighting crime and that gang members take advantage of the system's perceived weaknesses.
