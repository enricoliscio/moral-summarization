Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a specific structure to follow, so I should stick to that.

First, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. That means looking for words that carry a strong moral connotation, like "violence," "sobering," "staggering," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each of these words, making sure to list them each on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, I have to write a summary of the article. The summary needs to be concise, no more than 200 words, and include as many of those morally framed words as possible. I should make sure the summary captures the key points: the high number of homicides, the spike in shootings, the reasons behind the increase (like illegal guns, lack of deterrent, police reluctance), and the impact on the community, especially the poor and predominantly black areas.

I should also mention the measures the city is taking, like adding more officers and installing cameras, and the underlying issues such as the distrust in the police force after the Laquan McDonald incident. It's important to highlight the moral implications, like the emboldened criminals and the failure of the criminal justice system.

I need to be careful to keep the summary within the word limit and ensure it flows well, maintaining the moral framing from the original article. I'll structure it by first stating the problem, then the causes, and finally the responses and implications.

**SUMMARY:**

Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in violence, particularly in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, has been attributed to a flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrent against gun crime. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted that criminals feel emboldened, perceiving the criminal justice system as ineffective. The city's gang activity and the aftermath of the Laquan McDonald shooting incident have contributed to public distrust in law enforcement, leading to fewer arrests and a reluctance among officers to act. Efforts to address the violence include adding 1,000 officers and installing street cameras, but the root causes, such as poverty and systemic issues, remain unresolved. The moral implications of the crisis highlight the failure of the justice system and the exploitation of societal weaknesses by criminals.
