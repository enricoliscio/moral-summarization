SUMMARY: 

Chicago has experienced one of its most violent years in history, with 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents compared to 2015. The city's police department attributes this surge in violence to the flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system. According to Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, criminals feel "emboldened" to commit violent crimes due to lax gun laws and a perception that they have little to fear from the justice system. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives such as adding more police officers and installing street cameras. However, critics argue that police officers have become more cautious and reluctant to do their jobs due to fear of being scrutinized and becoming the next "viral video."
