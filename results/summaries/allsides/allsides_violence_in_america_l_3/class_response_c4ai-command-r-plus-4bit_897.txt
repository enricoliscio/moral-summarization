SUMMARY: The year 2016 saw a surge in violent crime in Chicago, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, marking the most violent year in two decades. This spike has brought Chicago to the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. The increase in homicides, up from 485 in 2015, is the largest in 60 years. The city's police department has attributed this surge to a flood of illegal guns, with 8,300 guns recovered in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year. Gang activity and a lack of deterrence for gun crimes have also been cited as contributing factors. Chicago's top cop, Eddie Johnson, pointed out that the city is not alone in facing this challenge, as other US cities have also experienced spikes in violence, including attacks on law enforcement. The bulk of Chicago's homicides and shootings occurred in just five of the city's 22 police districts, all in predominantly black and impoverished areas where gangs are most active. The city has responded by adding 1,000 officers to the police force and implementing initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot detection systems. However, critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to engage in proactive policing due to increased scrutiny and fear of becoming the next "viral video." The release of video footage showing the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, by a white officer has also been cited as a factor in the increased violence.
