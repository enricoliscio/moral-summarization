SUMMARY:
Chicago ended one of its most violent years in history with a staggering tally of 762 homicides, a spike in violent crime that has sparked a national dialogue about gun violence. The increase in homicides, up from 485 in 2015, is the largest spike in 60 years and has been attributed to a flood of illegal guns, emboldened criminals, and lax gun laws. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lamented the lack of a deterrent for gun crimes, stating that criminals have little to fear from the criminal justice system. The bulk of the deaths and shootings occurred in predominantly black and poor areas where gangs are most active, with more than 80% of the victims identified as susceptible due to gang ties or past arrests. Johnson attributed the surge in violence to several factors, including anger at police and the release of video footage of a controversial police shooting. He also noted that officers have become more cautious, fearing public scrutiny and the potential for becoming a "viral video". The city has responded by adding 1,000 officers and implementing new initiatives, but critics argue that officers have become reluctant to do their jobs effectively. The complex interplay between police practices, criminal justice, and gang activity has left Chicago grappling for solutions to curb the rising tide of violent crime.
