SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in violent crime in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, the highest in two decades. The increase in homicides, a spike of 277 from the previous year, is the largest in 60 years. The violence was concentrated in five of the city's predominantly black and poor South and West side police districts, where gangs are most active. Police attribute the rise in violence to a flood of illegal guns and a criminal justice system that fails to deter crime. Superintendent Eddie Johnson cited lax gun laws and anger towards police as additional factors, with criminals feeling emboldened and less fearful of consequences. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has pledged to add 1,000 officers to the police force, while Johnson hopes new initiatives will help curb the violence. The release of a video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, has also impacted public trust and police morale, with officers becoming more cautious and arrests declining. Critics argue that police have become reluctant to do their jobs, allowing gang violence to flourish. Johnson acknowledges the challenges and aims to restore trust and combat crime more effectively.
