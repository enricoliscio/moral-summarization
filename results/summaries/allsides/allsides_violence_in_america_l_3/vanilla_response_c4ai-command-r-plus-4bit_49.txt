SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in gun violence in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, the highest in two decades. The increase has been attributed to various factors, including lax gun laws, a weakened police force due to the Laquan McDonald shooting, and a state law requiring lengthy contact cards for police stops. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson expressed concern about criminals becoming emboldened and the lack of deterrence for gun crimes. The bulk of the violence occurred in five predominantly black and poor districts on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has responded by adding 1,000 officers and implementing new initiatives like street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. Johnson believes that criminals feel less fear of the criminal justice system and that gang members view the system as a joke. The statistics have placed Chicago at the center of a national dialogue on gun violence.
