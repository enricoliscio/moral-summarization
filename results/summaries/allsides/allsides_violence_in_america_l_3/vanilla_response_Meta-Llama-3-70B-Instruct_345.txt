SUMMARY:

Chicago ended 2016 with a record 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The city saw 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to a flood of illegal guns and a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system. He also cited anger towards police and a perception that criminals have little to fear from the law. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in five poor and predominantly black police districts on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, including adding 1,000 officers to the police department and implementing new initiatives such as street cameras and gunshot-detection systems.

END OF SUMMARY.
