SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in violent crime in 2016, with a staggering 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, marking the most violent year in two decades. The increase in bloodshed has placed Chicago at the center of a national dialogue on gun violence. The city's police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, attributed the rise in attacks to a flood of illegal guns, a weakened criminal justice system, and anger towards police. Johnson lamented the lack of deterrence for gun crimes, highlighting that gang members consider the court system a joke. The majority of these crimes occurred in poor, predominantly black areas where gangs are most active. 

Police have expressed concern about criminals becoming emboldened and less fearful of the consequences of their actions. The release of video footage of a police shooting of a black teenager further strained community-police relations and may have contributed to a pullback in proactive policing. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has promised to add 1,000 officers to the police department, while Johnson hopes that technological initiatives will help curb the violent crime rate. Chicago's struggle with violence underscores a complex interplay of social, economic, and criminal justice factors.
