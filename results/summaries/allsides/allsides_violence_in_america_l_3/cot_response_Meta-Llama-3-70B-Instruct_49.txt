SUMMARY:
The city of Chicago has ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The surge in violence has left police and city officials lamenting the "flood of illegal guns" into the city. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the spike in violence to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling "emboldened" to commit violent crimes due to lax gun laws and a weakened criminal justice system. The majority of the deaths and shootings occurred in poor and predominantly black areas, with over 80% of the victims having gang ties or past arrests. Johnson hopes that new initiatives, including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems, will lead to more arrests and drive down the violent crime rate. However, critics argue that police have become "reluctant" to do their jobs, fearing becoming the next "viral video." END OF SUMMARY.
