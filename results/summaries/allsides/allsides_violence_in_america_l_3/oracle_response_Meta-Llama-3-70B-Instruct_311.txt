SUMMARY:

Chicago has ended one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015. The city's third-largest city in the US has seen a surge in bloodshed, with a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The statistics paint a grim picture of a city plagued by violence, with the majority of deaths and shootings occurring in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributes the spike in violence to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling emboldened to commit crimes due to lax gun laws and a perception that the court system is a joke. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that police have become more reluctant to do their jobs, leading to a drop in arrests and a sense of impunity among criminals.
