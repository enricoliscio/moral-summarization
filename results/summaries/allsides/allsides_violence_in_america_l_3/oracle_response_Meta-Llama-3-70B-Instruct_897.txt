SUMMARY: Chicago has ended one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides, surpassing New York and Los Angeles combined. The city saw a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered, with 8,300 seized in 2016. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to a lack of deterrent, with criminals feeling emboldened due to lax gun laws and a weak criminal justice system. The majority of deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor, predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Johnson lamented that gang members view the court system as a "joke" and that the price for being caught is small compared to other cities. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems. However, critics argue that officers have become reluctant to do their jobs, leading to a drop in arrests and a perception of a weakened police force. END OF SUMMARY.
