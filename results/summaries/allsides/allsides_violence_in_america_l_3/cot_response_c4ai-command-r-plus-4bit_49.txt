SUMMARY:
Chicago ended 2016 with a staggering number of homicides and shooting incidents, marking one of the most violent years in the city's history. The surge in violence has sparked a national dialogue about gun violence and has left many searching for answers. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson pointed to several factors contributing to the increase, including the flood of illegal guns into the city and a lack of deterrence for gun offenders. He also suggested that anger at police and a perceived weakening of the police force, following the release of a video showing an officer shooting a black teenager, may have emboldened criminals and made them feel less fear of the criminal justice system. The bulk of the shootings and homicides occurred in predominantly black, poor areas where gangs are most active, and police have noted that gang ties or past arrests made the majority of victims more susceptible. Johnson hopes that initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems will help drive down the violent crime rate. However, critics argue that officers have become more cautious and reluctant to engage in proactive policing due to fears of negative publicity and scrutiny. The city is now grappling with how to address this surge in violence and restore public trust in the police department.
