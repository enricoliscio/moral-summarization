SUMMARY:

The city of Chicago saw a record 762 homicides in 2016, the most in two decades, with a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The increase in homicides is the largest spike in 60 years, with 1,100 more shooting incidents than in 2015. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the surge in violence to a lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system, with criminals feeling emboldened to commit violent crimes. He also pointed to the flood of illegal guns into the city and anger towards police following the release of a video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in five police districts on the city's South and West sides, predominantly black and poor areas where gangs are most active. The city has scrambled to address the violence, with initiatives including more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems.
