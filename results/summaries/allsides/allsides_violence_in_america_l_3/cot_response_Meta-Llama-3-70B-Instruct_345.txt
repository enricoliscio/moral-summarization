SUMMARY:
The city of Chicago has witnessed one of its most violent years in history, with a staggering 762 homicides and 1,100 more shooting incidents compared to 2015. The surge in violence has been attributed to the flood of illegal guns and a perceived lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lamented that criminals feel "emboldened" to commit violent crimes, and that the court system is seen as a "joke" by gang members. The majority of the deaths and shootings occurred in poor and predominantly black areas on the South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Johnson hopes that initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems will lead to more arrests and drive down the violent crime rate. However, critics argue that police officers have become more cautious and reluctant to do their jobs, creating an environment where criminals can commit "nefarious" activities with little fear of consequences.
