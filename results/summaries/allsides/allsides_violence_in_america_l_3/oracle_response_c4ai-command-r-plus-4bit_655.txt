SUMMARY: Chicago saw a surge in homicides and shootings in 2016, with 762 homicides and 3,550 shooting incidents, marking one of the most violent years in the city's history. The increase in bloodshed has sparked a national dialogue about gun violence and the role of law enforcement in public safety. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the rise in violence to several factors, including the flood of illegal guns into the city, a lack of deterrence for gun crimes, and anger towards police following the release of a video showing an officer shooting a teenager. The bulk of the shootings and homicides occurred in five predominantly black and poor police districts on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Johnson and Mayor Rahm Emanuel have implemented initiatives to curb the violence, including adding more officers and expanding surveillance measures. However, critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to engage in proactive policing due to increased scrutiny and fear of becoming the next "viral video". The decline in arrests and increasing violence have left many questioning the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in addressing these issues.
