SUMMARY: Chicago ended 2016 with a staggering number of homicides: 762, the most in two decades and more than New York and Los Angeles combined. The surge in violence has put Chicago at the center of a national dialogue about gun violence. Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns into the city, with 8,300 recovered in 2016, a 20% increase from the previous year. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson attributed the violence to a lack of deterrence for gun crimes, with criminals emboldened by a perceived weakness in the criminal justice system. The majority of shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black areas where gangs are most active, and police noted that over 80% of the victims had gang ties or prior arrests. The city has pledged to address the violence, including adding 1,000 officers to the police department and implementing new initiatives such as more street cameras. Johnson also cited the release of video footage of a fatal police shooting of a black teenager as a factor in the surge, suggesting that it has led to a weakened perception of the police force. Critics argue that officers have become more reluctant to do their jobs, allowing gangs to operate with impunity. The challenges faced by Chicago underscore the complex nature of urban violence and the need for comprehensive solutions that address both law enforcement and social issues.
