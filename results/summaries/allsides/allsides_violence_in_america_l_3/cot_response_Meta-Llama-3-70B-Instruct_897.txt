SUMMARY:
The city of Chicago has ended 2016 with a staggering 762 homicides, the most in two decades, and a 20% increase in illegal guns recovered by police. The spike in violence has been attributed to the flood of illegal guns and a perceived lack of deterrent in the criminal justice system. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lamented that criminals feel "emboldened" to commit violent crimes, and that the court system is seen as a "joke" by gang members. The majority of the deaths and shooting incidents occurred in poor and predominantly black areas on the city's South and West sides, where gangs are most active. Johnson hopes that initiatives such as more street cameras and gunshot-detection systems will lead to more arrests and drive down the violent crime rate. However, critics argue that officers have become more cautious and reluctant to do their jobs, leading to a "pull back" that allows gangs to "kill each other". END OF SUMMARY.
