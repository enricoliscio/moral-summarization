Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Chicago's record-high homicides and shootings in 2016, the spike in illegal guns, police challenges, and the impact of public trust after the Laquan McDonald shooting. 

I need to identify the key morally charged words: homicides, bloodshed, violence, shootings, crime, attacks, emboldened, deterrent, stealing, pre-trial, deaths, incidents, arrests, shot, fighting, killed, murder, kill, nefarious, activity.

I'll start by noting the main statistics: 762 homicides, highest in 20 years, more than NY and LA combined. Then, the increase in shootings. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson's points about illegal guns, the lack of deterrent, and the impact of the McDonald shooting on police trust and criminal emboldenment.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues: the surge in violence, the lack of deterrent leading to more crimes, the impact of public scrutiny on police actions, and the resulting increase in nefarious activities by criminals.

I'll make sure to include words like homicides, bloodshed, violence, shootings, crime, emboldened, deterrent, killed, nefarious activity. I'll keep the summary under 200 words and use the provided tokens.

Let me draft this, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
In 2016, Chicago experienced its most violent year in two decades, with 762 homicides—more than New York and Los Angeles combined—and 3,550 shooting incidents, a 20% increase from 2015. The surge in bloodshed has sparked national concern over gun violence, with police attributing the rise to a flood of illegal guns. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson highlighted the lack of a deterrent, noting that offenders face minimal consequences, emboldening criminals to commit violent crimes. The majority of deaths and shootings occurred in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, where gang activity is prevalent. Victims were often targeted due to their gang ties or past arrests. Johnson linked the surge to the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video, which eroded public trust in the police and made officers more cautious, fearing scrutiny. Critics argue this reluctance has allowed gangs to operate with impunity, committing nefarious activities. The city has introduced initiatives like street cameras and gunshot-detection systems to curb violence, but the challenge remains daunting. END OF SUMMARY.
