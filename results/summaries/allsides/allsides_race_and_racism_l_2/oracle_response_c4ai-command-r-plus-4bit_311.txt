SUMMARY: A new generation is rising against racial injustice, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. In 1960, the author and their friends were arrested for violating segregation laws by entering a whites-only library in Greenville, South Carolina. Despite the Supreme Court ruling that "separate but equal" was unconstitutional, segregation and racial injustice persisted. Protests spread across the South, facing violent resistance and denunciation. However, the movement persevered and achieved significant victories with the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. The author worked with Dr. King and witnessed the transformation of the South as legal apartheid was dismantled. Yet, racism and biased institutional structures remain. Now, a new generation is challenging these injustices, with widespread protests following George Floyd's murder. This movement has broad support and is driving change, despite resistance from entrenched interests and political figures like Donald Trump. It offers the promise of making America better and breaking the chains of racial injustice. This is a call to action for all with a conscience to join this moral struggle.
