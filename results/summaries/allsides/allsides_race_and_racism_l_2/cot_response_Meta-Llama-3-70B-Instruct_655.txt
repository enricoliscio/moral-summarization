SUMMARY:
The inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice is driving a new era of change in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recounts their personal experience of violating segregation laws in 1960, which sparked a movement that eventually led to the end of legal apartheid in the United States. However, the author notes that racism was not eradicated, and biased institutional structures still enforce racial injustice. A new generation is now emerging to challenge these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history, demanding reform and equality. Despite facing great resistance, the movement holds great promise for America, and it is a time for anyone with a conscience and a pulse to join this extraordinary movement. END OF SUMMARY.
