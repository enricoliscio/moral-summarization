Okay, so the user has given me a task where I need to summarize a news article. They provided the article and an example of how the summary should look. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice in America, comparing it to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author shares personal experiences from the 1960s, like being arrested for entering a whites-only library. They talk about the progress made with laws like the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act but also note that racism hasn't ended. The article then shifts to the current movement, highlighting its scale and the impact it's having, including policy changes and increased white participation.

Now, the user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." The example they provided is concise, capturing the key points: the comparison between past and present movements, the author's personal experience, the laws passed, the ongoing issues, and the current movement's momentum.

I should focus on the main ideas: the historical context, the author's role in the 1960s movement, the progress achieved, the remaining issues, and the current movement's scale and impact. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive.

I'll start by mentioning the comparison between the new generation and the past movement. Then touch on the author's personal experience, the laws passed, and the lingering issues like systemic racism. Finally, I'll highlight the current movement's size, participation, and the changes it's bringing, ending with the potential for a better America.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all these points without getting too detailed. Also, I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY:  
The article reflects on the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting racial injustice in America, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author recounts their personal experience in 1960, being arrested for entering a whites-only library in Greenville, South Carolina, despite the 1954 Brown v. Board decision. Segregation persisted, limiting opportunities for Black Americans. The movement grew, leading to landmark legislation like the Public Accommodations Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965). However, systemic racism remains, with issues like redlining, unequal schools, and a discriminatory criminal justice system persisting. The current movement, sparked by George Floydâ€™s murder, has seen unprecedented participation, with millions joining protests nationwide. This new generation is challenging racial injustice on a scale not seen before, with significant political responses, including police reform and symbolic changes like retiring the Confederate emblem in Mississippi. While resistance from powerful interests is expected, the author believes change is possible, as seen in the 1960s, when a determined generation broke the chains of legal apartheid. This new movement holds the potential to transform America and improve millions of lives. END OF SUMMARY.
