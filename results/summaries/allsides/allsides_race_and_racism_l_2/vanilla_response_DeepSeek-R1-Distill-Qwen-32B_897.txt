Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article talks about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice in America, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author shares personal experiences, like being arrested for integrating a library in 1960. They mention the impact of the Brown v. Board decision and how segregation persisted despite it. 

The author goes on to discuss the progress made, like the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, and their work with Dr. King. However, they point out that racism and institutionalized injustice still exist. The new protests, especially after George Floyd's murder, are the largest in history, with widespread participation, including more white people than the first movement. Politicians are starting to respond with reforms. 

The summary needs to capture the key points: the comparison between past and present movements, the author's personal role in the 1960s, the successes achieved but ongoing issues, and the significance of the current protests. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise yet comprehensive. I'll structure it by highlighting the historical context, the current movement's scale, and the potential for change despite resistance.
