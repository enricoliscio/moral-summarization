SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement and its similarities with the current protests against racial injustice. The author, who participated in a 1960 protest at a segregated library, notes that despite the progress made since then, racial injustices persist. The current generation's protests, sparked by George Floyd's murder, have been the largest in US history, with 15-26 million participants across 2,500 locations. White participation has been higher than in the first civil rights movement, and politicians have begun to respond with reforms. The movement aims to address criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and basic rights, which will face resistance from entrenched interests. However, the author believes that when people move, change is possible, as seen in the past. This new generation has an opportunity to make America better, and millions of lives and options are at stake.
