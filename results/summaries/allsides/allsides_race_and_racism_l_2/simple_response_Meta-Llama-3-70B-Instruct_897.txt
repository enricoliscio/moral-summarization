SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, which they were a part of, and sees parallels with the current protests against racial injustice. Despite the progress made since then, the author notes that systemic racism persists, and a new generation is rising to challenge it. The current movement, sparked by the murder of George Floyd, has seen unprecedented participation, with 15-26 million Americans taking part in demonstrations across 2,500 locations. The author sees promise in this movement, which is focused on reforming areas like criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and basic rights. They acknowledge that the movement will face resistance from entrenched interests, but believes that moral force can overcome even the most powerful obstacles. The author urges anyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement, which has the potential to make America better and improve the lives of millions.
