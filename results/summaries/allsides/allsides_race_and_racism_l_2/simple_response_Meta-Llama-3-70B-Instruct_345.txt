SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, when they, along with seven friends, protested against racial segregation by walking into a whites-only library in Greenville, South Carolina. Despite the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, segregation persisted in the South. The author recounts the fierce resistance they faced, but the movement ultimately led to the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, the author notes that racism was not eradicated, and biased institutional structures remained. The author sees hope in the new generation of protesters, who have organized the largest demonstrations in US history, with 15-26 million participants. White participation has exceeded that of the first civil rights movement, and politicians have begun to respond with reforms. The author believes that this movement has the potential to bring about significant change, just as the previous one did, and urges everyone with a conscience to join the fight against racial injustice.
