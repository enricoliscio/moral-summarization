Okay, so the user has provided a news article and wants a summary. The instructions are clear: I need to summarize the article, making sure it's under 200 words and formatted with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the comparison between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the current protests against racial injustice. The author shares personal experiences from the 60s, like being arrested for integrating a library. They mention the progress made, such as the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, but also highlight that racism still exists in institutions. The article then shifts to the new generation's protests post-George Floyd, noting their scale and impact, including policy changes and increased white participation.

I need to capture the key elements: the historical context, the author's personal involvement, the progress achieved, the remaining issues, the current movement's size and effects, and the hope for change. I'll structure the summary to flow from past achievements to current efforts, emphasizing continuity and new challenges.

I should keep each sentence concise, ensuring the summary is under 200 words. I'll avoid jargon and make it accessible. Also, I'll make sure to mention the significance of the current movement and the potential for future change.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each main point is included without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll format it correctly with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: The article reflects on the enduring fight against racial injustice in America, drawing parallels between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the current protests sparked by George Floydâ€™s murder. The author shares their personal experience of joining a 1960s protest to integrate a segregated library, highlighting the persistence of systemic racism despite legal victories like the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. While progress was made, structural inequalities in housing, education, employment, and criminal justice remain. The new generation of protesters, larger and more diverse than ever, is addressing these issues, with significant white participation and political responses, such as police reform and symbolic changes like retiring the Confederate flag. The author emphasizes that while resistance to change is inevitable, history shows that collective action can lead to transformative progress. The current movement holds the promise of a better America, but success depends on sustained effort and widespread support. END OF SUMMARY.
