SUMMARY: A new generation of protestors against racial injustice is rising in America, inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1960, the author joined a group of friends to protest segregation at a library in Greenville, South Carolina, despite facing resistance and violent opposition. The movement led to significant victories, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act, and opened the way for a more integrated South. However, racism and biased institutional structures enforcing racial injustice persist. Now, a new generation is challenging these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history. Despite facing resistance from entrenched interests, this movement has the power to transform America and create a more just society. It is a moral imperative for those with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement. END OF SUMMARY.
