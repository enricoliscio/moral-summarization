SUMMARY: The article reflects on the similarities between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the current movement against racial injustice.

They highlight how, despite legal victories in the 1960s, racism and institutional structures enforcing racial injustice persist today. The current movement, sparked by George Floyd's murder, has seen the largest protests in US history and significant white participation. Politicians have begun to respond with reforms, and the author encourages everyone to join this extraordinary movement for change. They believe that this new generation has the power to transform America and improve the lives of millions.
