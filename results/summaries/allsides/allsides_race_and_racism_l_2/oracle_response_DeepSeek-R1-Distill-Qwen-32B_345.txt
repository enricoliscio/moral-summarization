Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a detailed article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is reflecting on their experiences during the civil rights movement, comparing it to the current protests against racial injustice. They highlight the impact of past movements and the ongoing struggles, emphasizing the moral imperative for change.

Next, I'll identify the key events and moral terms. The author mentions being arrested, segregation, protests, the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, and the current movement following George Floyd's murder. Important terms include "protesting," "injustice," "change," "arrested," "segregated," "movement," "resistance," "reform," etc.

I need to structure the summary to cover the past and present movements, their impacts, and the moral call to action. I'll start by mentioning the rise of the new generation, then touch on historical events, the victories achieved, the remaining issues, and the current momentum. I'll ensure to include words like "rise," "protesting," "injustice," "change," "emerged," "build," "arrested," "segregated," "protests," "movement," "resistance," "reform," and "join."

I'll also need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but comprehensive. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically, connecting past struggles to the present movement, highlighting the moral stakes and the call for collective action.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved using the specified words. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure clarity and coherence.

SUMMARY: The rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice is driving a wave of change in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author reflects on their own experiences, including being arrested for violating segregation laws at the Greenville Library in 1960, highlighting the persistence of systemic injustice despite legal victories like the Brown v. Board decision. Segregation in schools, public spaces, and even graveyards was widespread, limiting opportunities for Black Americans. The author’s participation in protests and sit-ins, alongside others, marked a turning point, leading to significant reforms like the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. However, racism and biased institutions persist, from redlining to unequal schools and discriminatory criminal justice systems. Dr. King’s vision for economic equality, cut short by his assassination, now inspires a new generation to challenge these injustices. The largest protests in U.S. history, sparked by George Floyd’s murder, have seen unprecedented white participation and political responses, including police reform and symbolic changes like retiring the Confederate flag. Despite resistance from entrenched interests, this movement holds the promise of transforming America, urging anyone with a conscience to join the fight for equality and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
