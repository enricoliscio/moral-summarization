Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I have to write a concise summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to grasp the main points. It's about the author's experience in the civil rights movement, comparing it to the current protests against racial injustice. The author talks about past struggles, achievements, and the ongoing fight against systemic racism.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to extract all the morally framed words. These are words that carry strong ethical or moral connotations. Let me go through the article sentence by sentence.

The first paragraph mentions "inspiring rise," "protesting," "racial injustice," "change," "era," "generation," "civil rights movement," "arrested," "segregation laws." These all have moral implications.

Next, the author talks about the library protest, "segregated," "nothing had changed," "bubble," "limited options," "could not apply," "scholarship," "could not use," "vowed," "protests," "spread," "burst the bubble," "claim their rights." These words convey struggle and moral awakening.

Then, "demonstrations," "fierce resistance," "denounced," "outside agitators," "tarred," "socialists," "communists," "violent opposition," "vigilantes," "police officers." These show the moral conflict and opposition faced.

Moving on, "movement kept building," "Public Accommodations Act," "Voting Rights Act," "Edmund Pettus Bridge," "Selma," "Atlanta Braves," "desegregated," "African Americans," "win elections," "legal apartheid," "transformed the country." These highlight achievements and systemic change.

The article then addresses ongoing issues: "racism," "biased institutional structures," "red-lined neighborhoods," "unequal schools," "wage discrimination," "criminal justice system," "Dr. King’s drive," "economic equality," "assassination," "new generation," "George Floyd’s murder," "largest demonstrations," "Black lives," "protests," "white participation," "Mississippi legislators," "state flag," "Confederate battle emblem," "reforming police practices," "choke holds," "criminal injustice," "economic inequalities," "basic rights," "privileged," "powerful," "moral force," "glaring injustice," "opportunity," "make America better," "lives," "options," "stake," "extraordinary movement."

I think I've covered all the morally framed words. Now, I'll list them as per the instructions.

For the summary, I need to condense the article, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll start by mentioning the comparison between past and present movements. Highlight the author's personal experience, the resistance faced, the successes like the Voting Rights Act, and the ongoing struggles. Conclude with the current movement's potential and the call to action.

I should ensure the summary flows well, includes key morally charged words, and stays within 200 words. Let me draft it, making sure each sentence captures the essence without losing the moral weight.

**SUMMARY:**
The article reflects on the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting racial injustice, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author recounts their personal experience of being arrested for defying segregation laws in Greenville, South Carolina, highlighting the fierce resistance faced by activists. Despite challenges, the movement achieved significant milestones, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act, which transformed the South. However, systemic racism persists, manifesting in red-lined neighborhoods, unequal schools, and a discriminatory criminal justice system. A new generation, galvanized by George Floyd’s murder, has launched the largest demonstrations in U.S. history, with unprecedented white participation. Politicians have begun to respond, reforming police practices and removing symbols of racism, such as Mississippi’s Confederate flag. This movement holds great promise, challenging entrenched interests and striving for criminal justice reform, economic equality, and basic rights. As seen 60 years ago, when people unite against injustice, change becomes possible. The stakes are high, and this generation has the opportunity to make America better, urging all with conscience to join the extraordinary movement for justice. END OF SUMMARY.
