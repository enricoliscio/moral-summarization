Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author shares personal experiences from that era, like being arrested for integrating a library. They also discuss the progress made, such as the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, but note that racism persists in institutions. The current movement, sparked by George Floyd's murder, is larger and more inclusive, with significant political responses. The author emphasizes the potential for change but warns of resistance and the importance of continued action.

I should focus on the key points: the comparison between past and present movements, personal experiences, legislative changes, ongoing issues, the scale of current protests, and the moral imperative to continue the fight. I need to keep it under 200 words and ensure the moral aspect is clear—highlighting justice, equality, and the struggle against systemic racism.

SUMMARY:  
The article highlights the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author recounts their personal experience of being arrested for integrating a whites-only library in 1960, illustrating the persistence of segregation despite legal rulings. The movement faced fierce resistance but ultimately led to significant reforms, including the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. However, systemic racism persists in institutions, such as unequal schools, wage discrimination, and a biased criminal justice system. The current movement, sparked by George Floyd’s murder, is the largest in U.S. history, with unprecedented white participation and political responses, including police reforms and the removal of Confederate symbols. The author emphasizes the moral imperative to continue the fight for justice, equality, and systemic change, urging everyone with a conscience to join this transformative movement. END OF SUMMARY.
