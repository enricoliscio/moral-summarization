Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about the author's experiences during the civil rights movement in the 1960s and how a new generation is continuing the fight against racial injustice today. The author talks about their personal involvement in protests, the resistance they faced, and the eventual successes like the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. But they also point out that racism and institutionalized injustice still exist, leading to the current protests following George Floyd's murder. The author emphasizes the scale of the current movement, the increased white participation, and the potential for change despite resistance.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspects, like the struggle against injustice and the hope for change. I should include key points: the author's past activism, the impact of the civil rights movement, the ongoing issues, the new protests, and the potential for a better future. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main ideas without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with the author's experience, mention the civil rights achievements, then the current state of racial injustice, the new protests, their scale, and the hope for change despite resistance. I should use phrases that highlight the moral drive, like "moral force" and "opportunity to make America better."

I should also make sure to mention the comparison between the past and present generations, showing continuity and the ongoing fight. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and concise. Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary that flows well and stays within the word limit.
