SUMMARY:
The inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice is driving a new era of change in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author reflects on their own experiences with segregation and the fight for rights under the Constitution. Despite the progress made, including the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act, racial injustice persists. A new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history, including white participation. The movement holds great promise for America, but will face great resistance from entrenched interests. The fight is focused on reforming areas like criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and basic rights, which threaten the privileged and powerful. This is a time for anyone with a conscience and a pulse to join this extraordinary movement. END OF SUMMARY.
