SUMMARY: The fight against racial injustice in America has a long history, with parallels between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the current era of protests against racial inequality. In 1960, the author joined a group of friends to challenge segregation by entering a whites-only library in Greenville, South Carolina, an act of defiance against unjust laws. Despite the Supreme Court ruling that "separate but equal" was unconstitutional, segregation remained entrenched in the South. The author and other activists faced violent resistance and were denounced as agitators, but their movement brought about significant change, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. However, racism and institutional structures that enforce racial injustice persist. A new generation is now rising to challenge these injustices, with recent protests against racial inequality being the largest in American history. This movement has the potential to bring about meaningful change, but it will face significant resistance from those who benefit from the status quo. It is a moral imperative for people of conscience to join this struggle and work towards a better, more just America.
END OF SUMMARY.
