Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. The article is about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice in America, drawing parallels with the civil rights movement of the 1960s. 

First, I should identify the key points. The author talks about their personal experience with segregation in the 1960s, the protests, the resistance they faced, and the eventual successes like the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. They also mention that while legal segregation ended, systemic racism persists. Now, a new generation is taking up the cause, leading to large-scale protests and some political responses, like police reforms and changes in symbols.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral aspect, which emphasizes justice, resistance, and the ongoing struggle against systemic racism. The author is highlighting the progress made but also the work that still needs to be done, urging people to join the movement.

I should structure the summary to include the historical context, the current movement, the challenges, and the call to action. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me start by mentioning the new generation's protests, compare them to the 1960s movement, outline the author's personal experience, the successes achieved, the remaining issues, and the current momentum with the new protests. I'll end with the call for continued action.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward, preserving the moral tone. I'll make sure to highlight the moral imperative and the potential for change, as the author does.
