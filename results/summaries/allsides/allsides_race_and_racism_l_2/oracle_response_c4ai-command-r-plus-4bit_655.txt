SUMMARY: A new generation is rising to protest racial injustice and drive change, just as a previous generation did 60 years ago during the civil rights movement. The author, arrested for violating segregation laws in 1960, recounts how protests and demonstrations against racial injustice and segregation led to significant changes in the law and transformed the country. Despite these achievements, racism and biased institutional structures that enforce racial injustice remain prevalent. A new generation is now emerging to challenge these injustices, with recent demonstrations in response to George Floyd's murder being the largest in US history. This movement faces resistance from those who wish to maintain the status quo, but it also holds great promise for further change. It is a time for people of conscience to join this movement and help make America better for all.
END OF SUMMARY.
