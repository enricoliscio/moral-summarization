SUMMARY:

The article reflects on the current protests against racial injustice in America, drawing parallels with the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author, who was part of the 1960s movement, recounts their experiences of segregation and discrimination in Greenville, South Carolina. Despite the progress made since then, including the passage of the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act, racism and biased institutional structures persist. The current protests, sparked by George Floyd's murder, have seen unprecedented participation, with 15-26 million Americans taking part in demonstrations across 2,500 locations. The movement has already led to some reforms, such as changes to police practices and the retirement of Mississippi's Confederate-flagged state flag. The author believes that this new generation of protesters holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. They urge anyone with a conscience to join the movement, which has the potential to make a significant positive impact on the lives of millions.
