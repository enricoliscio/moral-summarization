SUMMARY:
The article recounts the author's experience of racial injustice in the 1960s and draws parallels with the current movement against racial injustice. The author recalls being arrested for violating segregation laws in 1960 and notes that despite the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, segregation persisted in Greenville, South Carolina. The author highlights the importance of the civil rights movement, which led to the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, the author acknowledges that racism was not eradicated and that biased institutional structures still enforce racial injustice. A new generation is now emerging to challenge these injustices, with demonstrations against racial injustice being the largest in history. The movement holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. The author urges anyone with a conscience to join the movement to make America better. END OF SUMMARY.
