Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice in America, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author shares personal experiences from the 1960s, like being arrested for integrating a library, and reflects on the progress made since then, such as the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. However, they also point out that racism and systemic inequalities still exist, which is why a new generation is taking up the cause, especially after George Floyd's murder. The summary needs to capture the inspiration, the historical context, the ongoing issues, and the hope for change, all while keeping the moral tone intact. I should make sure to mention the personal experiences, the victories, the remaining challenges, and the current movement's impact and potential. I'll aim for a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the moral drive and the significance of the new generation's efforts.
