SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recounts their personal experience of violating segregation laws in 1960, which sparked a turning point in their life and fueled the movement. Despite facing fierce resistance, the movement kept building and won significant victories, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. However, the author notes that racism was not eradicated, and biased institutional structures still enforce racial injustice. The assassination of Dr. King cut short his drive for economic equality. Now, a new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history, featuring white participation and prompting politicians to respond with reforms. The movement holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. The author urges anyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement, which has the power to transform the country and make lives better.
