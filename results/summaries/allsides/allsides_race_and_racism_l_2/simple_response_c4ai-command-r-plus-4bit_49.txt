SUMMARY: A new generation of protesters against racial injustice is rising in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. In 1960, the author joined a group of friends to protest segregation at a library in Greenville, South Carolina, despite facing fierce resistance. Their actions contributed to the passage of the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act, breaking legal apartheid in the country. However, racism and biased institutional structures remain entrenched. Now, a new generation is challenging these injustices, with larger and more diverse demonstrations than ever before. This movement has already sparked political change, such as police practice reforms and the retirement of the Mississippi state flag with its Confederate emblem. Despite expected resistance, the author is hopeful that this generation will succeed in making America better and more equitable for millions of people. This is a call to action for all people of conscience to join this moral struggle.
END OF SUMMARY.
