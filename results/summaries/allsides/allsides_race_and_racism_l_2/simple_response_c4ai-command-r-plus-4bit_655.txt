SUMMARY: A new generation of protestors is rising up against racial injustice, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recalls their own experience of being arrested for protesting segregation in 1960, five years after the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision. Despite the legal ruling, segregation still permeated every aspect of life in Greenville, South Carolina. The author and their peers took a stand, sparking a wave of demonstrations across the South. While their efforts led to significant legislative changes, they fell short of eradicating racism and institutional structures that perpetuate racial injustice. Now, a new generation is carrying the torch, fueled by the tragic murder of George Floyd. The protests have been unprecedented in scale and impact, with politicians already taking steps to address police practices and symbols of Confederate legacy. This generation has the power to create meaningful change, but they will face resistance from those who benefit from the status quo. However, as history has taught us, when people unite and take a stand, change becomes inevitable. It is time for all conscientious individuals to join this moral movement and help create a better, more just America.
END OF SUMMARY.
