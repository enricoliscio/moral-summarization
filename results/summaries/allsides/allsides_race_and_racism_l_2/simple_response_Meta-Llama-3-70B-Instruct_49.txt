SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, which they were a part of, and draws parallels with the current generation of protesters fighting against racial injustice. The author recounts their own experiences with segregation in Greenville, South Carolina, and how they joined the movement, getting arrested for violating segregation laws. They highlight the progress made since then, including the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act, but also acknowledge that racism and biased institutional structures persist. The author sees hope in the new generation of protesters, who have organized the largest demonstrations in history, with widespread white participation. They note that politicians have begun to respond, reforming police practices and banning choke holds. The author emphasizes that this movement has the potential to bring about significant change, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. They urge everyone with a conscience to join this movement, which can make America better and improve the lives of millions.
