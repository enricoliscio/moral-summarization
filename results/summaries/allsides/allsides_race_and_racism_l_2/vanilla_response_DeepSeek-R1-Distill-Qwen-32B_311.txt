Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice in America, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. 

The author shares a personal story from 1960 when they were arrested for integrating a library in Greenville, SC. They mention the 1954 Brown v. Board decision but note that segregation persisted. The author couldn't attend local universities and had limited resources, leading to their participation in protests. 

Key points include the success of the civil rights movement with laws like the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, the author acknowledges that racism and institutional structures still exist. They mention Dr. King's focus on economic equality, which was cut short. 

Now, a new generation is protesting, especially after George Floyd's murder, with massive participation and significant political responses. The movement's goals challenge powerful interests but have the potential to bring change, as seen historically.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting the comparison between past and present movements, key events, and the ongoing struggle against systemic racism. I'll focus on the author's experience, the successes of the 60s, the current movement's scale, and the hope for future change.
