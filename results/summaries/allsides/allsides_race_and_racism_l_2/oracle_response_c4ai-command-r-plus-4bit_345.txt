SUMMARY: A new generation of protestors is rising against racial injustice and driving change in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recalls their personal experience with segregation in South Carolina, where public spaces, education, and even the graveyard were segregated. Despite the Supreme Court ruling that "separate but equal" was unconstitutional, nothing had changed in Greenville. The author and their friends were arrested for violating segregation laws by entering the whites-only Greenville Library. Protests and sit-ins began to spread, facing fierce resistance from those opposed to change. However, the movement persisted and won significant victories, such as the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. The author worked with Dr. King to break down legal apartheid in the US and transform the country. While racism and biased institutional structures remain, a new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices. The recent demonstrations following George Floyd's murder have been the largest in US history, with widespread participation and impact. This movement faces resistance but holds great promise for further change. It is a time for all conscientious people to join and support this struggle for a better America.
END OF SUMMARY.
