SUMMARY:
The author reflects on the parallels between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the current era of racial justice protests. The author recounts their personal experience with segregation in South Carolina, where despite the Supreme Court ruling, racial segregation and discrimination persisted. The author participated in a protest at a whites-only library in 1960, which was a turning point in their life and helped spur a broader movement for change. That movement led to significant victories, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act, and paved the way for African Americans to attain positions of power and influence in the South. However, the author acknowledges that racism and institutional biases remain entrenched in American society, perpetuating injustices in criminal justice, education, employment, and housing. A new generation of protesters has emerged in response to the murder of George Floyd, and their demonstrations have been the largest in US history. This movement has already sparked political action and promises to challenge the privileged and powerful in pursuit of equality and justice. The author encourages all people of conscience to join this extraordinary movement and help create a better America.
