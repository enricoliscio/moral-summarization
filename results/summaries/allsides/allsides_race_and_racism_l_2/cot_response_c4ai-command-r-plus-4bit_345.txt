SUMMARY: A new generation is rising against racial injustice and fighting for their rights, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recounts their personal experience with segregation in South Carolina, where despite the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, segregation still prevailed. Protests and sit-ins emerged, challenging the unjustified segregation. The author was arrested for protesting at a whites-only library, sparking a turning point in their life and a wider movement. They faced violent resistance and denunciation but persevered, leading to landmark legislation in 1964 and 1965 that struck down legal segregation. While these victories transformed America, they did not eradicate racism or biased institutional structures that enforce racial injustice. Now, a new generation is challenging these injustices once again, with the largest demonstrations in history. This movement faces resistance from entrenched interests and a morally bankrupt political leadership, but it has the power to create meaningful change, as was proven 60 years ago. This generation has the opportunity to make America better and improve the lives of millions. It is a moral imperative for all with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement. END OF SUMMARY.
