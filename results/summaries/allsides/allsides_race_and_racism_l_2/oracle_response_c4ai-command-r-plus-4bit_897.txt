SUMMARY: A new generation is rising against racial injustice, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author, arrested in 1960 for protesting segregation, recalls the long journey to break down legal apartheid in the US. Despite successes like the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act, racism and biased institutional structures remain. The assassination of Dr. King halted the drive for economic equality. Now, a new wave of protests sparked by George Floyd's murder has brought about the largest demonstrations in US history. This movement faces resistance, but it also holds great promise for challenging criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and discriminatory systems. As seen 60 years ago, change is possible when people unite against injustice. This generation has the power to transform America, and all people of conscience are called to join this moral struggle.
END OF SUMMARY.
