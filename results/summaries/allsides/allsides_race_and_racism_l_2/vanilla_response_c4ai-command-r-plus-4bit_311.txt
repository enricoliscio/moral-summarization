SUMMARY: The author, a civil rights activist, reflects on the parallels between the current protests against racial injustice and the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He recounts his personal experience of being arrested for protesting segregation in 1960, five years after the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision. The author highlights how the civil rights movement of the 1960s led to significant legal victories, such as the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act, and opened the door for a more inclusive and economically vibrant South. However, he acknowledges that racism and institutional biases remain entrenched in America. The author expresses hope in the emerging generation of protesters, who have the power to bring about meaningful change, as evidenced by the widespread demonstrations and political responses following George Floyd's murder. He encourages everyone to join this movement for a better America.
