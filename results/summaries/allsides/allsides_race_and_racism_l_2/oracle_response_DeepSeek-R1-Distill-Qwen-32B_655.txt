Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the emotional tone. The author is reflecting on the civil rights movement, comparing it to the current protests against racial injustice. 

I notice that the article uses strong moral words like "rise," "protesting," "injustice," and "change." These words are crucial for maintaining the moral stance the author is taking. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The article talks about personal experiences, like being arrested for using a whites-only library, which shows the resistance faced. It also mentions significant events like the Brown v. Board decision and the Voting Rights Act. These are important milestones that highlight the progress made and the ongoing struggles.

The user wants the summary to be no longer than 200 words and to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I should structure the summary to flow from past struggles to current movements, emphasizing the continuity and the ongoing fight against racism.

I'll start by introducing the new generation's protests, then reference the author's personal experience and historical context. Next, I'll mention the progress achieved but also the remaining issues like systemic racism. Finally, I'll conclude with the potential impact of the current movement and the call to action.

I need to ensure that the summary is concise but comprehensive, capturing the moral urgency and the historical perspective. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick strictly to the content of the article, making sure the moral framing is preserved through the selected words.

SUMMARY:  
The rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice is driving a transformative era in America, echoing the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author reflects on their own experience, including being arrested for violating segregation laws at the Greenville Library in 1960, highlighting the persistence of systemic racism despite legal victories like the 1954 Brown v. Board decision. Segregation was widespread, limiting opportunities for Black Americans in education, employment, and public spaces. The movement gained momentum through sit-ins, demonstrations, and resistance, eventually leading to landmark legislation like the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. However, racism and biased institutions persist, from redlining to unequal schools and a discriminatory criminal justice system. The author notes that Dr. King’s vision for economic equality was cut short, but a new generation is now emerging to challenge these injustices. The protests following George Floyd’s murder have been the largest in U.S. history, with widespread participation and political responses, including police reform and symbolic gestures like retiring the Confederate flag in Mississippi. This movement holds promise but faces resistance from entrenched interests. The author emphasizes that change is possible when people unite against injustice, urging everyone with a conscience to join the fight for a better America. END OF SUMMARY.
