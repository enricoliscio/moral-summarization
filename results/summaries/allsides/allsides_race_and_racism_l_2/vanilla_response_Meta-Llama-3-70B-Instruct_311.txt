SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, which he was a part of, and draws parallels with the current protests against racial injustice. He recalls his own experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws in a South Carolina library in 1960. Despite the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, segregation persisted, and it took protests and demonstrations to bring about change. The author notes that while the movement achieved significant milestones, such as the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act, it did not eradicate racism. Today, a new generation is emerging to challenge ongoing injustices, with massive protests and demonstrations across the country. The author is hopeful that this movement will bring about meaningful change, despite expected resistance from entrenched interests. He urges everyone with a conscience to join the movement and make America better.
