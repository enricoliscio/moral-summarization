SUMMARY: A new generation is rising against racial injustice and driving change in America, mirroring the civil rights movement of 60 years ago. The author recalls their personal experience with segregation in South Carolina and the limited options for African Americans at the time. Protests began to spread, with students challenging segregation through sit-ins and demonstrations. Despite facing fierce resistance, the movement gained momentum and achieved landmark victories with the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. The author worked with Dr. King and witnessed the transformation of the South as legal apartheid was dismantled. However, racism and biased institutional structures remain entrenched. A new generation is now emerging to challenge these injustices, with the recent protests against racial injustice being the largest in US history. This movement faces resistance from those in power, but it holds great promise for further change. It is a time for all people of conscience to join and support this struggle for a better America.
END OF SUMMARY.
