SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, which they were a part of, and draws parallels with the current generation of protesters fighting against racial injustice. The author recounts their personal experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws in 1960 and the subsequent progress made in the civil rights movement. However, they acknowledge that despite the progress, racism and biased institutional structures persist. The author is heartened by the current wave of protests, which they see as a promising development for America. They note that the movement has already led to some reforms, such as changes to police practices and the retirement of the Mississippi state flag. The author emphasizes that the movement faces resistance from entrenched interests, but believes that moral force can bring about change, just as it did 60 years ago. They urge anyone with a conscience to join the movement, which has the potential to make America better and improve the lives of millions.
