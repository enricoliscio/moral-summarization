Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice in America, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author shares personal experiences from the 1950s and 1960s, like being arrested for entering a whites-only library. They talk about the progress made, such as the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, but also point out that racism and systemic issues still exist. The author mentions the current protests after George Floyd's murder, noting their scale and impact, and expresses hope for future change despite resistance.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include key points: the comparison between past and present movements, the author's personal involvement, the laws passed, remaining issues, the scale of recent protests, and the hope for change. I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, highlighting the main ideas without getting bogged down in details.

Let me structure it: start with the new generation's protests, reference the past movement, mention the author's arrest, the impact of the 1960s legislation, the ongoing issues, the current protests' size, and the hope for change despite challenges. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be brief but comprehensive.

I should also make sure to include the author's involvement with Dr. King and the economic aspects of the movement. The summary should flow logically, showing the progression from past to present and the ongoing struggle for equality.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll write the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and captures all essential points.
