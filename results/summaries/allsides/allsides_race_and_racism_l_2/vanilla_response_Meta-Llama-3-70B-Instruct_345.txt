SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, which he was a part of, and draws parallels with the current protests against racial injustice. He recalls his own experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws in a Greenville, South Carolina library in 1960. Despite the Supreme Court's 1954 decision declaring segregation unconstitutional, little had changed in his hometown. The author credits the protests of the time with bringing about significant change, including the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, he acknowledges that racism persists, and institutional structures continue to enforce racial injustice. The current protests, sparked by George Floyd's murder, have seen unprecedented participation, with 15-26 million Americans taking part. The author believes this new generation of protesters holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. He urges anyone with a conscience to join the movement to make America better.
