SUMMARY: A new generation of protestors against racial injustice is rising in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. In 1960, the author joined a group of friends to protest segregation at a library in Greenville, South Carolina, despite fierce resistance. This act of defiance was part of a broader movement that led to significant legal changes, such as the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. The movement also opened doors for African Americans in education, sports, and politics. However, it did not eradicate racism or institutional biases that perpetuate racial injustice. Now, a new generation is challenging these injustices, with recent demonstrations in response to George Floyd's murder being the largest in US history. This movement faces resistance from those who benefit from the status quo, but it has the potential to bring about meaningful change, as demonstrated by the achievements of the civil rights movement. This is a moral imperative, and all people of conscience are called to join this struggle for a better America.
END OF SUMMARY.
