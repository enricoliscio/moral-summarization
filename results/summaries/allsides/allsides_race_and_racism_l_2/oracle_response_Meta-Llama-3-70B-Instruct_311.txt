SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recounts their personal experience of violating segregation laws in 1960, which sparked a wave of protests and demonstrations that ultimately led to the end of segregated public facilities and the Voting Rights Act. Despite this progress, the author notes that racism and biased institutional structures persist, and a new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices. The recent demonstrations in response to George Floyd's murder have been the largest in history, with 15-26 million Americans participating. The movement holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. The author urges anyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement, which has the power to drive change and make America better.
