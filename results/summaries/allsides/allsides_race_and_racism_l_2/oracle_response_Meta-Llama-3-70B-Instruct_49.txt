SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recounts their own experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws in 1960, despite the Supreme Court's 1954 decision declaring "separate but equal" a lie. The author highlights the limited options and segregated facilities that existed at the time. However, protests began to spread, and students decided to burst the bubble of segregation, claiming their rights under the Constitution. The movement faced fierce resistance, but ultimately won the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. Despite progress, racism and biased institutional structures persisted. Now, a new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history, including white participation. The movement holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. The author urges anyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement, as change is possible when people move.
