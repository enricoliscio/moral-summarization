SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, which he was a part of, and draws parallels with the current protests against racial injustice. He recounts his personal experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws at a whites-only library in Greenville, South Carolina, and how it sparked his involvement in the movement. The author notes that despite the progress made since then, racial injustice persists, and a new generation is emerging to challenge it. He cites the massive protests following George Floyd's murder, with 15-26 million Americans participating, and the subsequent reforms, such as police practice changes and the retirement of Mississippi's Confederate-flag state flag. The author emphasizes that this movement faces great resistance from entrenched interests, but believes that, like 60 years ago, the moral force of a generation demanding change can overcome even the most powerful obstacles. He urges anyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement to make America better.
