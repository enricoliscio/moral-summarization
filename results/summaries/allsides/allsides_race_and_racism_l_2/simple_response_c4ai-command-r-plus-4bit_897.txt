SUMMARY: A new generation of protesters against racial injustice is rising in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. In 1960, the author joined a group of friends to protest segregation at a library in Greenville, South Carolina, despite fierce resistance. The movement led to significant changes, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. However, racism and biased institutional structures remain prevalent in the country. The recent protests following George Floyd's murder have been the largest in US history, with a significant increase in white participation. This new generation of protesters faces resistance from entrenched interests but holds great promise for driving meaningful change. It is a time for all people of conscience to join this movement and make America better for millions of lives.
END OF SUMMARY.
