SUMMARY: The author reflects on the parallels between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the current movement against racial injustice. They recount their personal experience of being arrested for protesting segregation in a South Carolina library in 1960, five years after the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision. Despite the legal ruling, segregation still permeated every aspect of life in Greenville, South Carolina. The author and their peers took action, inspired by similar protests across the South, and faced violent opposition. They detail the legislative victories of the civil rights movement, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act, and their work with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. While legal segregation was dismantled, institutional racism persists, and economic inequality and biased structures remain. The current movement, sparked by George Floyd's murder, has seen the largest protests in US history and significant white participation. Politicians have begun to respond with police reforms and symbolic changes, like Mississippi's retirement of its Confederate flag. The author encourages everyone to join this movement, believing it has the power to transform America and improve the lives of millions.
