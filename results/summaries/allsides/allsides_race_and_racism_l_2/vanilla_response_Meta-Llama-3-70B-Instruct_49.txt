SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the 1960s civil rights movement, which he was a part of, and draws parallels with the current protests against racial injustice. He recounts his experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws in 1960 and how the movement eventually led to the passage of the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, he notes that despite these gains, racism and biased institutional structures persist. The author is heartened by the current wave of protests, which he believes holds great promise for America. He notes that the new generation of protesters is focused on reforming areas such as criminal justice, economic inequalities, and basic rights, and that white participation has far exceeded that of the first civil rights movement. The author urges everyone with a conscience to join this movement, which has the potential to make America better and improve the lives of millions.
