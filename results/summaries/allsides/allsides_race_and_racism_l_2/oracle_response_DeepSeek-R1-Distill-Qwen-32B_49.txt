Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The author used specific morally charged words, and I need to include as many as possible in the summary. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, comparing it to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author shares personal experiences from the 1960s, like being arrested for trying to use a whites-only library. They mention the 1954 Brown v. Board decision but note that segregation continued. The author participated in protests, sit-ins, and worked with Dr. King, leading to significant legislation like the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, racism persists in institutions, and a new generation is now challenging these injustices, with large-scale protests and political responses. The author emphasizes the moral force of the movement and its potential to bring change despite resistance.

Now, I need to create a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes the key morally framed words. I'll start by outlining the main points: the new generation's protests, historical context, personal experiences, achievements, remaining issues, current movement's scale, and the call to join.

I should make sure to include words like "rise," "protesting," "injustice," "change," "emerged," "build," "arrested," "segregation," "violating," etc. I'll structure the summary to flow from past movements to the present, highlighting the moral drive and the ongoing struggle.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes as many moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, drawing parallels to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author recounts their personal experience being arrested for violating segregation laws while attempting to use a whites-only library. Despite the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, segregation persisted, limiting opportunities and enforcing inequality. The movement, marked by sit-ins and demonstrations, faced violent resistance but ultimately led to significant reforms, including the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, racism and institutional bias continue to persist, prompting a new generation to challenge injustices. The current protests, sparked by George Floyd's murder, are the largest in U.S. history, with widespread participation and political responses. The movement aims to reform criminal justice, economic inequalities, and basic rights, threatening the privileged but holding great promise for change. As the author reflects, when people unite morally, change becomes possible, urging everyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement. END OF SUMMARY.
