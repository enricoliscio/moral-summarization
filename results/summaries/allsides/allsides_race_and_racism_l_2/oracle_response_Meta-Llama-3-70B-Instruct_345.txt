SUMMARY: 

The author reflects on the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, driving a new era of change in America. The author recalls their own experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws in 1960, five years after the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision declared "separate but equal" a lie. The author notes that despite the progress made, racism was not eradicated, and biased institutional structures still enforce racial injustice. However, a new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history, including 15-26 million Americans participating in protests for Black lives. The movement has already led to reforms, such as banning choke holds and retiring the Mississippi state flag with its Confederate battle emblem. The author emphasizes that this generation has an opportunity to make America better, but will face great resistance from entrenched interests. The author urges anyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement, as the lives and options of millions are at stake.
