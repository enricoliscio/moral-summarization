Okay, I need to summarize this article while keeping the moral framing intact. The author is talking about the civil rights movement and the new protests against racial injustice. I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me break it down.

First, the author mentions the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice. That's a key point. I need to include "rise" and "protesting." They compare it to the generation from 60 years ago, so I should mention that.

Then, the author gives a personal story about being arrested for violating segregation laws. I should include words like "arrested," "violating," and "segregation." It's important to highlight the unchanged conditions despite the Brown v. Board decision.

The author talks about the impact of the protests, winning the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. Words like "won," "end," and "discrimination" are crucial here. Also, the mention of Dr. King and the economic equality drive adds moral weight.

Now, the author shifts to the present, noting that racism still exists. Words like "racism," "biased," and "injustices" should be included. The new generation's protests are the largest in history, so I'll use "emerging," "challenge," and "protest."

The resistance from powerful interests is another moral point. Words like "resistance," "reform," and "stake" are important. Ending with a call to action using "join" and "conscience" ties it all together.

I need to make sure the summary flows well, covering past movements, current protests, and the ongoing struggle. I'll structure it to show the continuity and the moral imperative for change.

SUMMARY: The article highlights the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, echoing the civil rights movement of 60 years ago. The author recounts their personal experience of being arrested for violating segregation laws in 1960, despite the Brown v. Board decision, which declared "separate but equal" a lie. Segregation persisted in Greenville, South Carolina, limiting opportunities and enforcing inequality. The movement spread, with sit-ins and demonstrations facing violent resistance but ultimately winning landmark reforms like the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, racism and biased institutions remain, from redlining to unequal schools and criminal justice. A new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices, with widespread protests following George Floyd's murder, exceeding previous movements in scale and white participation. Despite resistance from entrenched interests, the moral force of this generation offers hope for change, urging all with conscience to join the fight for a better America. END OF SUMMARY.
