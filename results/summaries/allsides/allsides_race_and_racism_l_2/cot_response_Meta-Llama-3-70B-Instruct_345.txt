SUMMARY:
A new generation of protesters is driving change in America, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author, who was part of the 1960s movement, recalls the injustices of segregation, including being arrested for violating segregation laws at a whites-only library. Despite the progress made, including the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act, racial injustice persists, with biased institutional structures enforcing discrimination. A new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history, including 15 million to 26 million Americans participating in protests for Black lives. The movement holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. It's a time for anyone with a conscience to join the extraordinary movement and make America better.
