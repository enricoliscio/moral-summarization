SUMMARY: A new generation is rising up against racial injustice, evoking the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The author recalls their personal experience of segregation in South Carolina, where public spaces and institutions remained segregated years after the Brown v. Board decision. Despite fierce resistance and opposition, protests and demonstrations led to landmark legislation, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. While legal apartheid was dismantled, racism and biased institutional structures enforcing racial injustice persist. Dr. King's push for economic equality was cut short by his assassination. Today, a new generation is challenging these injustices, with protests against criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and basic political and economic rights. This movement faces resistance from those who feel threatened, but the lessons from the past show that change is possible when people unite against injustice. This generation has the opportunity to make America better and improve the lives of millions. It is a moral imperative for those with a conscience to join this movement. END OF SUMMARY.
