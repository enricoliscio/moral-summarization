SUMMARY:
A new generation is rising against racial injustice, echoing the civil rights movement of 60 years ago. The author recounts their own experience of protesting against segregation in 1960, which led to their arrest. Despite the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, segregation persisted in Greenville, South Carolina. The author joined the movement, which faced fierce resistance, but ultimately led to the Public Accommodations Act and Voting Rights Act. However, racism persisted, and now a new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices. The recent demonstrations, sparked by George Floyd's murder, have been the largest in history, with 15-26 million Americans participating. White participation has far exceeded that of the first civil rights movement. The movement holds great promise for America, but will face resistance from entrenched interests. END OF SUMMARY.
