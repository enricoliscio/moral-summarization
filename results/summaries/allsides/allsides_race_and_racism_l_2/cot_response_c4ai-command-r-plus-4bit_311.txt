SUMMARY:
A new generation is rising against racial injustice and fighting for their rights, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. In 1960, the author and their friends protested segregation at a library in Greenville, South Carolina, despite fierce resistance and violent opposition. Their actions contributed to the passing of the Public Accommodations Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965, breaking some of the legal chains of racial injustice in the United States. However, racism and biased institutional structures remain entrenched. Now, a new wave of protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd has emerged as the largest in US history, with millions participating across the country. This movement faces resistance from those who benefit from the status quo of criminal injustice, economic inequalities, and discriminatory practices. Yet, as history has shown, when people unite and act with moral force, change becomes possible. This generation has the power to transform America and improve the lives of millions. It is a call to action for all those with a conscience to join this movement and create a better future.
