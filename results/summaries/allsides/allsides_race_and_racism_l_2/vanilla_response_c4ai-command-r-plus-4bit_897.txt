SUMMARY: The inspiring rise of a new generation protesting racial injustice mirrors the civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1960, the author was arrested for violating segregation laws by entering a whites-only library in Greenville, South Carolina. Despite legal rulings, segregation remained entrenched in the South. Protests and sit-ins emerged, facing violent resistance. But the movement led to landmark legislation, ending segregation in public facilities and expanding voting rights. The author worked with Dr. King and witnessed the transformation of the South, but acknowledges that racism and institutional biases persist. Today, a new generation challenges these injustices, with protests against racial inequality being the largest in US history. Despite expected resistance, this movement has the potential to bring about significant change, just as the civil rights movement did 60 years ago. This is a call to action for all Americans to join this movement for a better America.
