SUMMARY:

The author reflects on the inspiring rise of a new generation protesting against racial injustice, reminiscent of the civil rights movement 60 years ago. The author recounts their personal experience of violating segregation laws in 1960, which sparked a turning point in their life and fueled the movement. Despite facing fierce resistance, the movement kept building and won significant victories, including the Public Accommodations Act and the Voting Rights Act. However, the author notes that racism was not eradicated, and biased institutional structures still enforce racial injustice. Now, a new generation is emerging to challenge these injustices, with the largest demonstrations in history, including 15-26 million participants. White participation has exceeded that of the first civil rights movement, and politicians have begun to respond with reforms. The author urges anyone with a conscience to join this extraordinary movement, which holds great promise for America and can bring about significant change.
