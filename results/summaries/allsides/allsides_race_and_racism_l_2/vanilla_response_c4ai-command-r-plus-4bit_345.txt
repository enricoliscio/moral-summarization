SUMMARY: In 1960, the author joined a group of friends to protest segregation at a South Carolina library, an act of civil disobedience that led to their arrest. This was part of a broader movement by young people across the South to challenge racial injustice and demand their constitutional rights. Despite facing violent opposition, the movement achieved significant victories, including the desegregation of public facilities and the passage of the Voting Rights Act. However, institutional racism and economic inequality persist, and a new generation is now rising up to continue the fight for racial justice. The recent protests following the murder of George Floyd have been the largest in US history, and politicians have begun to respond with reforms. The author encourages everyone to join this movement to create a better America.
