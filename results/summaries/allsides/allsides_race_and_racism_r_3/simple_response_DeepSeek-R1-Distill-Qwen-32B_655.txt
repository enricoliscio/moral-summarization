Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article discusses the debate over Confederate statues, arguing that they shouldn't be honored. It mentions President Trump's support for keeping them, conservatives' fear of losing tradition, and the context of why these statues were erected, often to glorify the Confederacy falsely.

I should highlight the main points: the statues are offensive, especially to African Americans, and they were created to promote a false narrative. The article also suggests moving them to museums rather than destroying them, and mentions the importance of recognizing the human cost of the Civil War.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the moral arguments, like the statues affronting black citizens and the flawed cause they represent. Also, note that while preserving history is important, it should be done respectfully, not through mob action.

Let me structure the summary: start with the debate, mention the arguments against the statues, the context of their erection, the suggestion to move them, and the conclusion about honoring a flawed cause.

Make sure to include key names like Robert E. Lee and Frederick Douglass, and the point about the Confederacy's true motives, like slavery and secession being traitorous.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all these elements within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article argues against the preservation of Confederate statues, framing them as symbols of a flawed and harmful history. It highlights that these statues, such as the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Virginia, are an affront to Black citizens, as they celebrate individuals who defended slavery and a cause that sought to destroy the Union. The author criticizes the idea that Confederate statues should remain as part of tradition, arguing that they were erected to promote a false narrative of the Confederacy as a noble cause, rather than one rooted in slavery and secession. The article suggests that while history should be acknowledged, Confederate symbols like statues and the Confederate flag should be removed or recontextualized, particularly from prominent public spaces. Instead, they could be moved to museums or battlefields. The author also cautions against mob action, advocating for lawful removal. The piece emphasizes that the Confederacyâ€™s leaders, including Robert E. Lee, do not deserve honor, as their actions were traitorous and destructive to the nation. The article concludes that Confederate statues should not be vandalized but should be removed, as they symbolize a cause that was deeply flawed and incompatible with American values. END OF SUMMARY.
