SUMMARY:

The Confederate statues and symbols deserve to be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens who shouldn't have to see defenders of chattel slavery put on a pedestal. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and the South's leaders don't deserve to be given a place of honor. The statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy, and their preservation is a mistake. Instead, they should be transferred to museums or battlefields, and the Confederate flag should be shunned as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved, but the names of military bases should be reevaluated. The Richmond statue of Lee, a symbol of the Lost Cause mythology, should be removed, as it was built on the "great truth" of slavery. Secession was an act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders don't deserve to be honored.

END OF SUMMARY.
