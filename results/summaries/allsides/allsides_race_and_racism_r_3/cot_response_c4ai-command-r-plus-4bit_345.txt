SUMMARY:
There is a wave of cancellations sweeping America, and Confederate statues have become a particular target. While President Trump and conservatives have defended these statues as part of our heritage, the author argues that they deserve to be reevaluated and often removed. The context in which they were created—as part of a push to enshrine a prettified version of the Confederacy—and the affront they pose to black citizens are reasons enough to reconsider their place in our public spaces. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of the Civil War, but the statues themselves, particularly those in prominent public spaces, should be transferred to museums or battlefields. The removal of these statues should be done lawfully, not through mob action. The Confederate flag, as a symbol of a flawed and traitorous cause, should be shunned. The apotheosis of Robert E. Lee and the Lost Cause mythology are further examples of the South's attempt to rewrite history and deny the central role of slavery in the Civil War. The theory of states' rights used to justify secession was a tool to protect slavery, and secession itself was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation. The leaders of the Confederacy do not deserve the honor of having their names on our military bases or their statues in our public spaces. While these statues should not be vandalized, they should be removed to make way for a more accurate and inclusive understanding of our history. END OF SUMMARY.
