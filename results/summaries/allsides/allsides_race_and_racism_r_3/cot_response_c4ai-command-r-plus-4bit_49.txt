SUMMARY:
The removal of Confederate statues and symbols has sparked debate in the United States. While some, including President Trump, argue for preserving these monuments as part of our heritage, others view them as an unnecessary *affront* to Black citizens. The context of their creation, often as part of a push to enshrine a *dishonest* and *prettied-up* version of the Confederacy, is important to consider. Many argue that these statues *deserve* to be reevaluated and, in some cases, removed or transferred to museums or less prominent locations. While direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of the conflict, the Confederate flag should be *shunned* as a symbol of a *viciously flawed* cause. The removal of these statues is not about erasing history but about recognizing the *traitorous* nature of the Confederacy and the fact that its leaders do not represent *worthy* role models. While vandalism is not the answer, it is clear that Confederate statues *go*.
