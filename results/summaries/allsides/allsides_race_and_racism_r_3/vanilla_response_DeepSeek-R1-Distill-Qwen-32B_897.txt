Okay, I need to summarize the given article. The article discusses the debate over Confederate statues, particularly focusing on the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Virginia. It argues against the glorification of Confederate leaders, pointing out that their statues are offensive and should be removed or relocated.

First, I should identify the main points. The article mentions that Confederate statues are being targeted because they represent a problematic history, including slavery and secession. The author argues that these statues should not be in prominent public spaces and suggests moving them to museums or battlefields. They also mention the context in which these statues were erected, often to promote a distorted view of the Confederacy.

The article contrasts the conservative view, which supports preserving these symbols as part of heritage, with the argument that they are an affront to African Americans. It also touches on the role of the Confederate flag and the importance of preserving historical context without glorifying the Confederacy.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the main arguments, the context of the statues' creation, the opposition from conservatives, the impact on African Americans, and the suggestion to relocate statues rather than destroy them.

I should start by stating the debate over Confederate statues, mention the reasons for their removal, the conservative perspective, and the proposed solutions. I need to keep it concise, ensuring all key points are covered without going into too much detail.

Let me structure it: introduce the debate, explain the reasons for removal, mention the conservative viewpoint, discuss the impact on African Americans, suggest relocation, and conclude with the historical context and the need to preserve without glorifying.

I should make sure the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." as specified.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure each sentence covers a key point without exceeding the word limit.
