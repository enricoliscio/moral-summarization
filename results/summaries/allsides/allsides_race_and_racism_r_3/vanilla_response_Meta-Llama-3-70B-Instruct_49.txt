SUMMARY:

The article argues that Confederate statues and symbols should be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and glorify a flawed cause. The statues were often erected to promote a dishonest version of the Confederacy, and their removal is not about erasing history, but about acknowledging the harm they cause. The article suggests that statues in prominent public spaces should be transferred to museums or battlefields, while direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks and cemeteries, should be preserved. The Confederate flag should be shunned, and military bases named after Confederate generals should be reconsidered. The article concludes that secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders do not deserve a place of honor in our landscape.
