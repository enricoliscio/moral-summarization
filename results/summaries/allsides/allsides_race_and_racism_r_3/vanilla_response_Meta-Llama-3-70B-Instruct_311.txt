SUMMARY:

The article argues that Confederate statues and symbols should be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and glorify a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation. The statues were often erected to promote a dishonest, romanticized version of the Confederacy. While learning about historical figures like Robert E. Lee doesn't require grand statues, direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of the conflict. The article also suggests that military bases named after Confederate generals should be renamed, as it's hard to ask African-American soldiers to serve at bases named after those who fought to keep their ancestors enslaved. The Richmond statue of Lee, set to be removed, is a prime example of the problematic glorification of Confederate leaders.

END OF SUMMARY.
