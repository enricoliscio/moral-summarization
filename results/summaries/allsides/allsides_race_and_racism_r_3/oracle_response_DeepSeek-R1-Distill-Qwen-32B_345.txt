Alright, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the controversy around Confederate statues, arguing that they shouldn't be honored because they represent a flawed cause. It mentions secession as a traitorous act, which is a key moral point. The author criticizes President Trump and conservatives for defending these statues, using words like "defender" and "preserve." 

I notice that the article emphasizes how these statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest version of the Confederacy, using terms like "enshrine" and "erected." It also points out that the statues are an affront to black citizens, using "affront" and "offense." The author argues that these symbols should be moved to museums rather than vandalized, using "vandalized" and "action."

I should include the moral implications, such as the statues representing slavery and the Confederacy's flawed cause. The article also mentions the human cost of the Civil War and preserving memorials for the dead, using "dead" and "conflict." 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll structure it by first stating the main argument against the statues, then mention the opposition, the context of their erection, and the proposed solution of moving them to museums. I'll also touch on the moral issues like secession and the impact on African Americans.

Let me draft this, ensuring each sentence incorporates the moral framing words where appropriate. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary flows logically from one point to the next.

SUMMARY: The article argues against the honoring of Confederate statues, calling secession a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation. President Trump and conservatives defend these symbols, fearing a slippery slope of iconoclasm, but the author contends that Confederate statues and symbols deserve reevaluation and often should be mothballed. These monuments are an affront to black citizens, as they celebrate defenders of chattel slavery. Many were erected to enshrine a dishonest version of the Confederacy, and their context must be considered. While learning about figures like Robert E. Lee doesn’t require prominent statues, big statues in public spaces should be moved to museums or battlefields, not via mob action. The Confederate flag should be shunned, as it represents a flawed cause, while direct commemorations of the war dead, like obelisks and cemeteries, should be preserved to mark the conflict’s human cost. Confederate military bases pose a harder case, as their names may alienate African-American soldiers. The Richmond Lee statue, unveiled in 1890, symbolizes the Lost Cause mythology, which falsely claims the Civil War wasn’t about slavery. Alexander Stephens, the Confederacy’s vice president, openly tied it to slavery, refuting the idea that secession preserved constitutional rights. The author concludes that Confederate leaders don’t deserve honor, and while statues shouldn’t be vandalized, they should be removed. END OF SUMMARY.
