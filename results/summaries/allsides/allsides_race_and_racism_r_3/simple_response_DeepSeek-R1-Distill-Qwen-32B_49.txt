Okay, I need to summarize this article about Confederate statues. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the main points and the author's stance.

First, the article talks about how Confederate statues are being targeted because they represent a problematic history. The author argues that these statues are offensive to African Americans because they honor those who defended slavery. The context of when these statues were built is importantâ€”they were part of promoting a false, glorified version of the Confederacy.

The author also mentions that while some symbols like the Confederate flag should be avoided, other memorials like cemeteries could be kept to remember the human cost. They suggest moving statues to museums instead of destroying them. The article criticizes President Trump and conservatives for defending these statues, saying their approach is misguided.

I should highlight the moral argument against these statues, the historical context, and the proposed solutions. Also, I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise but covers all key points. I'll structure it by addressing the problem, the author's arguments against the statues, the proposed solutions, and the criticism of the conservative stance. That should capture the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: The article argues against the preservation of Confederate statues, framing them as symbols of a dishonorable past that glorifies slavery and disrespects African Americans. The author criticizes the statues as unnecessary affronts, erected to promote a false narrative of the Confederacy's "Lost Cause" mythology, which downplays slavery's central role in the Civil War. President Trump and conservatives defend these symbols, fearing a "slippery slope" of iconoclasm, but the author counters that Confederate statues and symbols deserve reevaluation and often removal. They propose moving statues to museums or battlefields, preserving historical context while avoiding public spaces that honor traitorous acts. The article also condemns the Confederate flag as a symbol of a flawed cause, while suggesting some memorials, like cemeteries, could remain to acknowledge the war's human cost. The author emphasizes that Confederate leaders, including Robert E. Lee, do not deserve honor, as their legacy is rooted in a nation built on slavery and secession, which threatened the American union. END OF SUMMARY.
