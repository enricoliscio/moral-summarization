SUMMARY:
The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating the country's heritage. These monuments were erected to enshrine a dishonest and prettied-up version of the Confederacy, and their presence is an unnecessary affront to black citizens. The Confederate flag is a symbol of a viciously flawed cause and should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved, but big statues in prominent public spaces should be transferred to museums or battlefields. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders don't deserve a place of honor. Confederate statues shouldn't be vandalized, but they should be removed and reevaluated. It's time to make distinctions and acknowledge the human cost of a terrible conflict. END OF SUMMARY.
