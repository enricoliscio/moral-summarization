SUMMARY:

The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating the country's history and values. These monuments were often erected to promote a distorted, glorified version of the Confederacy and slavery. They are an affront to black citizens, who should not have to see defenders of chattel slavery honored. While some conservatives argue that removing these statues is an attack on tradition and heritage, this perspective is misguided. It is essential to distinguish between monuments that promote a flawed cause and those that commemorate the human cost of the Civil War. The Confederate flag, in particular, should be shunned as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. Ultimately, Confederate statues and symbols do not deserve a place of honor in the American landscape, and their removal is a necessary step towards a more honest and inclusive understanding of the country's history.
