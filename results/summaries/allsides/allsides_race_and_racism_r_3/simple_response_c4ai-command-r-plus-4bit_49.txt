SUMMARY: The debate over Confederate statues and symbols has sparked controversy, with some defending their preservation while others advocate for their removal. The statues, erected to glorify the Confederacy, are an affront to Black citizens and a reminder of the defense of chattel slavery. The context of their creation and the dishonest narrative they promote cannot be ignored. While learning about Confederate history is important, the statues are unnecessary and should be relocated to museums or battlefields, preserving the memory of the human cost of the Civil War. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved, but the names of military bases honoring Confederate generals should be reconsidered, recognizing the trauma they inflict on African-American soldiers. The removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, Virginia, exemplifies this contentious issue, reflecting a Lost Cause mythology that downplays the centrality of slavery in the Civil War. The Confederacy's ideology of states' rights was a guise to protect slavery and justify treasonous secession. Preserving Confederate statues is a mistake that perpetuates a flawed and harmful narrative. These statues should be removed lawfully to rectify our moral landscape.
