SUMMARY:

The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step towards reckoning with America's past. These monuments were erected to glorify the Confederacy and whitewash its true purpose: defending chattel slavery. They are an affront to black citizens and perpetuate a dishonest narrative about the Civil War. While learning about historical figures like Robert E. Lee doesn't require grand statues, commemorations of the war dead should be preserved to acknowledge the human cost of the conflict. However, direct symbols of the Confederacy, like the Confederate flag, should be shunned. The names of military bases honoring Confederate generals will become increasingly problematic as the true nature of their actions becomes more widely known. Ultimately, secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders do not deserve a place of honor in our landscape.

END OF SUMMARY.
