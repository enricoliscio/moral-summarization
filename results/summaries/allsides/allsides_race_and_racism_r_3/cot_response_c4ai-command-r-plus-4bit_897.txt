SUMMARY:
The removal of Confederate statues and symbols has sparked debate, with many arguing that they are a despicable affront to Black citizens and a dishonest glorification of the Confederacy. While some, including President Trump, defend these monuments as part of our heritage, others argue they should be reevaluated and removed lawfully. The context of their creation matters: many were erected to promote a prettied-up, erroneous Lost Cause mythology, scoffed at by Confederate VP Alexander Stephens in his notorious Cornerstone Speech. The Confederacy's traitorous act of secession threatened to demolish the American nation, and its leaders don't deserve honor. Direct commemorations of the war dead should be preserved, but the statues, flags, and base names are an unnecessary desecration that should go. Frederick Douglass scorned the apotheosis of Robert E. Lee, a key figure in this mythology. The removal of the Lee statue in Richmond, VA, is symbolic of this reevaluation. These statues shouldn't be vandalized, but they should go.
END OF SUMMARY.
