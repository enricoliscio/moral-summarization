SUMMARY:

The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating America's history and values. These monuments were often erected to promote a distorted, glorified version of the Confederacy and its defense of chattel slavery. They are an affront to black citizens and should be transferred to museums or battlefields, rather than being prominently displayed in public spaces. The Confederate flag, a symbol of a flawed and vicious cause, should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks and cemeteries, should be preserved to acknowledge the human cost of the conflict. The names of military bases named after Confederate generals should be reconsidered, as they may become increasingly offensive to African-American soldiers. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders do not deserve a place of honor in our landscape.

END OF SUMMARY.
