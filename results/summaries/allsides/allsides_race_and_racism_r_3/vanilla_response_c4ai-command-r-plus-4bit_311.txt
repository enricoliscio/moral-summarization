SUMMARY: There has been a wave of cancellations targeting Confederate statues across America, with many being graffitied, torn down, or removed by authorities. While President Trump and conservatives have defended these statues as part of our heritage, others argue that they are an affront to black citizens and a reminder of the South's traitorous act of secession. The context of their creation and their role in promoting a dishonest version of the Confederacy should be considered. While direct commemorations of Confederate war dead should be preserved, statues of Confederate leaders and the Confederate flag should be removed from public spaces and transferred to museums or battlefields. The removal of these statues, such as the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, is part of dismantling the Lost Cause mythology that downplays the role of slavery in the Civil War. Secession was a threat to the American nation, and the South's leaders do not deserve places of honor.

END OF SUMMARY.
