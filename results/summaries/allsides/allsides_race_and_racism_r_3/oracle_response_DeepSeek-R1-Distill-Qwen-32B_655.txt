Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally framed words that I should include as much as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Confederate statues, arguing that they shouldn't be honored because they represent a flawed cause tied to slavery and secession. The author mentions the context in which these statues were erected, often to promote a dishonest view of the Confederacy. They also discuss the impact on African Americans and the need to preserve history but in a more appropriate way, like museums.

I need to make sure to include words like "secession," "traitorous," "offense," "affront," "enshrine," "flawed," "sacrifice," and others from the list. I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues with the statues, the context of their erection, and the call for their removal while respecting the process.

I'll start by stating that Confederate statues represent a flawed cause tied to secession and slavery. Then mention the context of their erection to promote a dishonest view. Next, address the affront to African Americans and the need to remove them lawfully. Also, include the point about preserving history in museums rather than public spaces. Finally, note the opposition from some, like Trump and conservatives, who want to preserve heritage but argue against erasing history.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically while incorporating the moral language.

SUMMARY:  
The article argues that Confederate statues and symbols represent a flawed cause tied to secession, slavery, and a dishonest view of history. Erected to enshrine a mythologized Confederacy, these statues affront African Americans by honoring those who defended chattel slavery. The author criticizes the tradition of preserving Confederate heritage, noting that while some may oppose removing these symbols, they should be reevaluated and often mothballed. Confederate statues in prominent public spaces should be transferred to museums or battlefields, not vandalized. The Confederate flag, a symbol of a viciously flawed cause, should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, like obelisks and cemeteries, should be preserved to mark the human cost of the conflict. However, military bases named after Confederate generals pose a harder case, as they reflect a problematic legacy that African-American soldiers may find offensive. The Richmond Robert E. Lee statue, for example, was unveiled in 1890 as part of a movement to create a cult of Lee as a moral hero, a narrative Frederick Douglass sarcastically criticized. The article emphasizes that secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders do not deserve honor. Confederate statues should not be vandalized but should be removed to reflect a more truthful understanding of history.  
END OF SUMMARY.
