SUMMARY:

The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating our nation's history and values. These monuments were often erected to promote a sanitized version of the Confederacy and slavery, and their presence is an affront to black citizens. While preserving our history is important, it's equally important to consider the context and purpose behind these monuments. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks and cemeteries, should be preserved to acknowledge the human cost of the conflict. However, big statues in prominent public spaces and symbols like the Confederate flag should be removed or transferred to museums or battlefields. This should be done lawfully, not through mob action. The leaders of the Confederacy, who committed treason and sought to destroy the American nation, do not deserve a place of honor in our landscape.
