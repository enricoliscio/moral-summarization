SUMMARY: The recent wave of cancellations in America has seen Confederate statues particularly targeted, with many being graffitied, assaulted, and torn down. While President Trump and conservatives have defended these statues as part of our heritage, the argument against them is that they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and a reminder of a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation. The context in which these statues were created and the dishonest, prettified version of the Confederacy they promote are also important considerations. While direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of the conflict, the statues of Confederate leaders and the Confederate flag should be removed as they do not deserve a place of honor in our landscape. The removal of these statues should be done lawfully and with consideration for the complexities of our history, but it is important to recognize that they are a reminder of a viciously flawed cause. END OF SUMMARY.
