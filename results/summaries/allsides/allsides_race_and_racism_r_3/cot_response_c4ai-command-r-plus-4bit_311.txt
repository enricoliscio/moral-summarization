SUMMARY:
The debate over Confederate statues and symbols in the United States has sparked strong moral opinions. Many argue that Confederate statues are an unnecessary offense to black citizens, glorifying defenders of the immoral practice of chattel slavery. The context of their creation, often promoting a dishonest version of the Confederacy, further taints their legacy. While learning about Confederate history is important, the massive statues in prominent public spaces can be relocated to museums or battlefields, lawfully and without mob action. The Confederate flag, a symbol of a flawed and immoral cause, should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead deserve preservation to mark the human cost of the Civil War. The removal of Confederate statues, such as the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Virginia, is justified as these leaders committed traitorous acts, threatening to destroy the American nation and uphold a republic built on slavery. While vandalism is not the solution, these statues should be removed from their places of honor, reserved for worthier individuals.
