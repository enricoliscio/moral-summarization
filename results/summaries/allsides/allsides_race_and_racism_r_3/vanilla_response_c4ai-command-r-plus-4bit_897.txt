SUMMARY: There has been a wave of cancellations sweeping America, with Confederate statues being particularly targeted. While President Trump and conservatives have defended the statues as preserving heritage, others argue that they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and should be reevaluated and sometimes removed. The context of their creation and their role in perpetuating a dishonest narrative about the Confederacy are important considerations. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved, but large statues in prominent public spaces should be transferred to museums or battlefields. The removal of statues should be done lawfully, not through mob action. The Confederate flag and the names of military bases named after Confederate generals are also controversial issues. The article concludes that Confederate statues are a mistake and should be removed, as the leaders of the Confederacy committed treason and do not deserve places of honor.

END OF SUMMARY.
