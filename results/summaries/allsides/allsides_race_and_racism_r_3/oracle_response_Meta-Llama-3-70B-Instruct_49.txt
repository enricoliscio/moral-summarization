SUMMARY:

The Confederate statues and symbols deserve to be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens who shouldn't have to see defenders of chattel slavery put on a pedestal. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and the South's leaders don't deserve to be given a place of honor. The statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy, and their preservation is a mistake. President Trump and conservatives oppose the removal of these statues, fearing a slippery slope of woke iconoclasm, but this impulse is misguided. Instead, we should make distinctions between symbols of the Confederacy, transferring some to museums or battlefields, while preserving others, like obelisks and cemeteries, to mark the human cost of the conflict. The Confederate flag should be shunned as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. It's time to stop defending the indefensible and acknowledge the harm these symbols have caused.

END OF SUMMARY.
