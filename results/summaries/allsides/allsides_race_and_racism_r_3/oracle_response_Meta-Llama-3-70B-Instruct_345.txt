SUMMARY:

The Confederate statues and symbols deserve to be reevaluated and often mothballed as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens, who shouldn't have to see defenders of chattel slavery put on a pedestal. The statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy, and their preservation is a mistake. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and the South's leaders don't deserve to be given a place of honor. The Confederate flag should be shunned as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of a terrible conflict. However, the names of military bases should be reevaluated, as it's hard to ask African-American soldiers to look past them. The Richmond statue of Lee, a symbol of the Lost Cause mythology, should be removed, as it was built on the "great truth" of slavery. Confederate statues shouldn't be vandalized, but they should go.

END OF SUMMARY.
