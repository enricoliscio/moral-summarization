SUMMARY:
The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating America's heritage. These monuments were erected to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy, and their presence is an unnecessary affront to black citizens. The Confederate flag is a symbol of a viciously flawed cause and should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks with lists of names, should be preserved to mark the human cost of a terrible conflict. However, big statues in prominent public spaces, like the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Va., should be transferred to museums or battlefields. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders don't deserve a place of honor. Confederate statues shouldn't be vandalized, but they should go. END OF SUMMARY.
