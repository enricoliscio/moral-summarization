Alright, I need to summarize this article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is arguing against Confederate statues, stating that they represent a flawed cause and are an affront to African Americans. They mention secession as a traitorous act, which is a strong moral statement. The statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest version of history, so I should include words like 'erected' and 'enshrine.'

The article also talks about how these statues were part of a movement to create a cult around figures like Robert E. Lee, using words like'movement' and 'creation.' The author references Frederick Douglass's scorn, so I'll include'scorned' or'scoffed' if possible.

I need to mention that while some symbols like the Confederate flag should be shunned, other memorials for the dead should be preserved to mark the human cost. The author also brings up military bases named after Confederates, highlighting the conflict for African American soldiers.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically. I'll start by stating the main argument against the statues, then touch on the historical context, the moral implications, and the distinctions the author makes about different types of memorials.

I also need to include the moral words like 'traitorous,' 'offense,' 'affront,' 'flawed,''sacrifice,' 'preserve,' etc. I'll make sure the summary reflects the author's stance that while some memorials should be moved, others should be preserved respectfully.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to first address the issue of the statues, then the historical context, the moral implications, and the distinctions the author makes, ending with the conclusion that the statues should be removed but respectfully, not through vandalism.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without making it too verbose. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and ensure clarity.

SUMMARY: The article argues against Confederate statues, framing them as symbols of a flawed and traitorous cause. The author condemns secession as an act that threatened to destroy the American nation, with statues erected to enshrine a dishonest version of history. Confederate symbols, including statues and the flag, are seen as an affront to African Americans, celebrating those who defended chattel slavery. The author distinguishes between direct commemorations of the war dead, which should be preserved to mark the human cost, and statues meant to glorify the Confederacy, which should be moved to museums or battlefields. The Richmond statue of Robert E. Lee, for example, has long been contentious, symbolizing a Lost Cause mythology that denies the central role of slavery in the Civil War. The author warns against a slippery slope where honoring Confederate leaders could lead to questioning figures like George Washington. While the author opposes vandalism, they argue that Confederate statues should be reevaluated and often removed, as they dishonor worthier individuals and perpetuate a legacy of racism. END OF SUMMARY.
