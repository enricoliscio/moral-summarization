SUMMARY:
The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating the country's history. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders don't deserve a place of honor. The statues are an unnecessary affront to black citizens, who shouldn't have to see defenders of chattel slavery put on a pedestal. Many of these monuments were erected to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy. The Confederate flag should be shunned as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. While direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved, big statues in prominent public spaces should be transferred to museums or battlefields. This should be done lawfully, not via mob action. END OF SUMMARY.
