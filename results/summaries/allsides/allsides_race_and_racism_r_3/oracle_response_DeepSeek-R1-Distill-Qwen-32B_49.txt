Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want a concise summary that retains the author's ethical perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the removal of Confederate statues, arguing against their glorification. It mentions the context of the statues, their erection as part of a movement to whitewash the Confederacy, and the moral issues they represent.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. These include words like "secession," "traitorous," "offense," "affront," "vandalized," etc. I should make sure these words are included in the summary to maintain the moral tone.

Next, I'll structure the summary. It should start by addressing the issue of Confederate statues, then touch on the arguments for their removal, the context of their erection, and the moral implications. I'll also mention the alternatives like moving statues to museums and preserving some symbols for historical context.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but comprehensive. I'll ensure that each key point from the article is covered without getting too detailed.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the problem, the arguments against the statues, the historical context, and the proposed solutions. I'll end by highlighting the importance of recognizing the Confederacy's true nature and the need for lawful removal.

Now, putting it all together, I'll craft a summary that includes the morally charged words and covers all the essential points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The article argues against the glorification of Confederate statues, calling secession a traitorous act that threatened the American nation. Confederate symbols, including statues and the Confederate flag, are seen as an affront to black citizens, as they honor defenders of slavery. Many statues were erected to enshrine a whitewashed version of the Confederacy, ignoring its foundation in slavery and states' rights as a tool to protect it. The author criticizes President Trump and conservatives for opposing the removal of these symbols, warning that preserving them risks erasing the Confederacy's true legacy. Confederate statues should be reevaluated and often removed, ideally to museums, while direct commemorations of the war dead, like cemeteries, should remain to mark the conflict's human cost. The Richmond Robert E. Lee statue, for example, symbolizes the "Lost Cause" mythology, which falsely claims the Civil War wasn't about slavery. The article concludes that Confederate statues should not be vandalized but should be removed, as their presence denies honor to worthier individuals and perpetuates a flawed historical narrative. END OF SUMMARY.
