SUMMARY:

The article argues that Confederate statues and symbols should be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and glorify a flawed cause. The context of their creation, often to promote a dishonest version of the Confederacy, should be considered. While learning about historical figures like Robert E. Lee doesn't require giant statues, direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved. The Confederate flag should be shunned, and military bases named after Confederate generals should be renamed. The article disagrees with President Trump and conservatives who want to preserve these symbols, fearing a slippery slope of "woke iconoclasm." Instead, it suggests a nuanced approach, transferring statues to museums or battlefields, and making distinctions between different types of commemorations.
