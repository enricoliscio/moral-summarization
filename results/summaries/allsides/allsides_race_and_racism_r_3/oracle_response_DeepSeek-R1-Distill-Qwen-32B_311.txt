Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about Confederate statues and the debate around them. The author is critical of these statues, arguing they represent a flawed history.

I notice the user provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included. I should make sure to use as many as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise.

First, I'll identify the key arguments. The author says secession was traitorous, threatening the nation. Confederate statues are an affront to African Americans because they celebrate slavery. The statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest version of history. They should be moved to museums, not vandalized. The Confederate flag should be shunned. The article also mentions the context of why the statues were built, like the Richmond Lee statue, and the myth that the Civil War wasn't about slavery.

I'll start the summary by stating the main point: Confederate statues are an affront. Then mention the reasonsâ€”secession as traitorous, the context of their erection, and the flawed history. I'll include that they should be moved lawfully, not vandalized, and the flag should be shunned. Also, note the human cost of the conflict and the difficulty for African-American soldiers.

I need to make sure to include words like secession, traitorous, affront, erected, enshrine, shunned, flawed, conflict, sacrifice, etc. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, covering each point succinctly.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to stay under 200 words, so each sentence should be impactful but brief. I'll avoid unnecessary details and focus on the moral arguments.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also make sure the summary starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: The article argues that Confederate statues are an affront to African Americans, as they celebrate a flawed history rooted in secession, a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation. These statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest version of the Confederacy, often to justify its defense of slavery. The author criticizes the idea of preserving Confederate symbols, such as military bases named after Confederate generals, as they symbolize a legacy of oppression. Instead, these statues should be moved to museums or battlefields, not vandalized, to preserve history while removing them from public spaces. The Confederate flag, a symbol of a viciously flawed cause, should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, like obelisks and cemeteries, should remain to mark the human cost of the conflict. However, the Richmond statue of Robert E. Lee, which has been a contentious symbol of the "Lost Cause," should be removed. This movement reflects the need to confront the truth about the Confederacy, which was built on slavery and sought to demolish the constitutional framework of the United States. The author warns against preserving symbols that deny the sacrifices of African Americans and uphold a legacy of racism. END OF SUMMARY.
