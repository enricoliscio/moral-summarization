Okay, so I need to summarize this article about the Confederate statues. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by talking about the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Va., and mentions that secession was traitorous. It then discusses how Confederate statues have been targeted, being defaced or removed. President Trump supports keeping them, and conservatives agree, fearing a slippery slope where more historical figures might be targeted. The author argues that Confederate statues should be reevaluated and often removed because they offend African Americans and represent a flawed history. They suggest moving statues to museums or battlefields instead of destroying them. The Confederate flag should be avoided, but memorials for the dead should stay. The article also mentions the history of the Lee statue in Richmond, which was part of a cult of personality, and references Frederick Douglass's criticism. It explains that the Confederacy's cause wasn't states' rights but slavery, citing Alexander Stephens and John C. Calhoun. The conclusion is that Confederate leaders don't deserve honor, and statues should be removed respectfully.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, making sure to include key points: the debate over Confederate statues, the author's stance on removing them, the historical context, and the impact on African Americans. Also, mention the alternatives like museums and preserving some memorials. Keep it concise and clear.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the debate over Confederate statues, arguing that they should be reevaluated and often removed due to their offensive nature and ties to slavery. Confederate statues, such as the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Va., have been targeted for removal as symbols of a flawed history. While some, like President Trump, advocate for preserving them, the author contends they offend African Americans and glorify a dishonest version of the Confederacy. Statues should be moved to museums or battlefields, and the Confederate flag should be avoided. Memorials for Confederate soldiers, however, should remain to honor the human cost of the Civil War. The article highlights the Confederacy's true purpose as upholding slavery, not states' rights, citing figures like Alexander Stephens and John C. Calhoun. The author concludes that Confederate leaders do not deserve honor, and statues should be removed respectfully rather than destroyed. END OF SUMMARY.
