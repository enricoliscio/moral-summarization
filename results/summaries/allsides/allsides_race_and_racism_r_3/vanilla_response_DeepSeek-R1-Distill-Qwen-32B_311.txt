Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Confederate statues. The user is asking for a news summary, so I should focus on the main points without getting too detailed. The article talks about why these statues are controversial and argues for their removal. 

First, the article mentions that Robert E. Lee's monument in Richmond is a focal point. It's important to note that the author sees the statues as symbols of a flawed history, particularly slavery. The author criticizes the idea that these statues are just part of heritage, pointing out that they were erected to glorify the Confederacy falsely.

I should also include the political aspect: President Trump and conservatives defending the statues, fearing a slippery slope where other historical figures might be targeted. But the author disagrees, saying the statues are offensive and should be moved to museums or battlefields instead of being destroyed by mobs.

Another key point is the context of why the statues were built, often during the Jim Crow era to reinforce white supremacy. The article also differentiates between different types of memorials, like the Confederate flag versus cemeteries, which should be preserved for historical remembrance but not celebrated.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements. I'll start by stating the main argument, then touch on the political debate, the context of the statues, and the differentiation between symbols and memorials. Ending with the conclusion that the statues should be moved, not vandalized.

SUMMARY: The article argues against the preservation of Confederate statues, viewing them as symbols of a flawed history rooted in slavery and secession. It highlights the controversy surrounding statues like Robert E. Lee's in Richmond, Virginia, which have been targeted for removal. Conservatives, including President Trump, defend these statues as part of American heritage, fearing a "slippery slope" where other historical figures might be discredited. However, the author contends that Confederate statues are an affront to Black Americans and should be reevaluated, with many moved to museums or battlefields rather than destroyed by mobs. The article emphasizes the context of these monuments, often erected to glorify a dishonest version of the Confederacy, particularly during the Jim Crow era. While direct commemorations of the Confederate dead, like cemeteries, should be preserved to acknowledge the human cost of the Civil War, symbols like the Confederate flag should be shunned. The article concludes that Confederate statues, while part of history, do not deserve prominent public spaces, as they celebrate a cause built on slavery and disunion. END OF SUMMARY.
