SUMMARY:
The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating our nation's history. These monuments, often erected to promote a dishonest and prettied-up version of the Confederacy, are an unnecessary affront to black citizens. They should be transferred to museums or battlefields, rather than being vandalized or destroyed. The Confederate flag, a symbol of a viciously flawed cause, should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks and cemeteries, should be preserved to mark the human cost of a terrible conflict. Secession, a traitorous act, threatened to destroy the American nation and its leaders don't deserve a place of honor. It's time to make distinctions and preserve our history in a way that is respectful to all citizens. END OF SUMMARY.
