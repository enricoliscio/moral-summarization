Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to identify all the morally charged words. Words like "traitorous," "dishonest," "viciously," "glories," "affront," "sacrifice," "apostrophes," "mythology," "legitimate," "prerogatives," "cornerstone," "slavery," "traitorous," "honor," "vandalized," and "glory" stand out as they carry strong moral connotations.

Next, I'll craft a concise summary that includes these words. I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and maintains the original's moral perspective. I'll focus on the main arguments: the Confederacy's role in slavery, the inappropriate glorification through statues, and the need for respectful removal rather than vandalism. I'll also touch on the historical context and the impact on African Americans. 

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, ensuring that each key point is addressed succinctly. This way, the summary will reflect the author's stance against Confederate symbols while respecting the need for lawful removal and preserving historical context in museums or battlefields.

**SUMMARY:**

The article argues against the glorification of Confederate statues, calling them an affront to Black citizens and a symbol of a dishonest, slavery-based Confederacy. The author condemns the traitorous act of secession, which sought to dismantle the American nation, and criticizes the mythology that downplays slavery's role. Confederate symbols, including statues and flags, should be reevaluated and removed from prominent public spaces, as they celebrate a flawed cause. While direct commemorations of the war dead, like cemeteries, should be preserved, military bases named after Confederate generals pose a harder dilemma, as they dishonor African-American soldiers. The Richmond Robert E. Lee statue, for instance, symbolizes the Lost Cause myth, which Alexander Stephens, the Confederacy's vice president, dismissed as false. The article advocates for lawful removal of such statues to museums or battlefields, rejecting both vandalism and the continued glorification of a treasonous, slavery-driven Confederacy. END OF SUMMARY.
