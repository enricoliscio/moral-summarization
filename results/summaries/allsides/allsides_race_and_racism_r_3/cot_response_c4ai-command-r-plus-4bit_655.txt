SUMMARY:
There is a wave of cancellations sweeping America, and Confederate statues have been a particular target. While President Trump and conservatives have defended these statues and other forms of recognition of the Confederacy, the author argues that they deserve to be reevaluated and often removed. The statues are an unnecessary *affront* to Black citizens and were often erected to promote a *dishonest*, *prettied-up* version of the Confederacy. Learning about Confederate history does not require massive statues in prominent public spaces. Instead, the author suggests that large statues in public spaces should be transferred to museums or battlefields, while direct *commemorations* of Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of the conflict. The removal of these statues is not about *vandalism*, but about recognizing that the Confederacy was a *traitorous* cause that does not *deserve* to be honored above *worthier* men. The Confederate flag should be *shunned* as a symbol of a *viciously flawed* cause. 

END OF SUMMARY.
