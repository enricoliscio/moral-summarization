Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Confederate statues. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." They also provided an example, so I should follow that structure.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the removal of Confederate statues, President Trump's support for them, the conservative perspective on preserving history, and the argument against these statues as symbols of slavery and white supremacy. It also mentions the context in which these statues were erected, often during the Jim Crow era to promote a false narrative about the Confederacy.

I need to make sure the summary captures the key arguments: the statues are offensive, they were erected to glorify the Confederacy's false history, the impact on African Americans, and the suggestion that they should be moved to museums rather than destroyed. Also, the article mentions the importance of preserving the memory of the war's human cost but not the glorification.

I should keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown. The example provided is well-structured, so I'll aim for something similar, making sure each sentence conveys a main point without getting bogged down in details.

Let me outline the main points:
1. Confederate statues are being removed, with some support from Trump and conservatives.
2. The statues are offensive to African Americans as they represent slavery.
3. The statues were erected to promote a false history of the Confederacy.
4. They should be moved to museums, not destroyed.
5. The Confederacy's true purpose was to maintain slavery, not states' rights.
6. Secession was traitorous and aimed at preserving slavery, so the leaders don't deserve honor.

Now, I'll condense these points into a coherent summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the controversy surrounding Confederate statues, arguing that they should be reevaluated and often removed due to their association with slavery and white supremacy. Many statues were erected during the Jim Crow era to promote a false narrative of the Confederacy as a noble cause, rather than acknowledging its true purpose of maintaining slavery. The article suggests that these statues, which are offensive to African Americans, should be moved to museums or battlefields rather than destroyed. It also highlights the Confederacy's use of states' rights rhetoric to justify secession, which was aimed at preserving slavery, not constitutional principles. The article concludes that the leaders of the Confederacy, who sought to create a slave-based nation, do not deserve places of honor, and that while the memory of the Civil War's human cost should be preserved, the glorification of the Confederacy should not. END OF SUMMARY.
