SUMMARY:

The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating our nation's history. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders don't deserve a place of honor. The statues are an unnecessary affront to black citizens, who shouldn't have to see defenders of chattel slavery put on a pedestal. Many of these monuments were erected to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy. It's impossible to evaluate these monuments without considering their context. The Confederate flag should be shunned as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of a terrible conflict. The Richmond statue of Lee, a key moment in the creation of a cult of Lee as a man of "moral strength and moral beauty," is coming down, and rightfully so. Secession was an act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders don't deserve to be given a place of honor. Confederate statues shouldn't be vandalized, but they should go.

END OF SUMMARY.
