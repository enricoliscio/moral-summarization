SUMMARY:

The article argues that Confederate statues and symbols should be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and glorify a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation. While conservatives defend these symbols, citing tradition and the fear of a slippery slope, the article contends that many of these monuments were erected to promote a dishonest, romanticized version of the Confederacy. Instead, direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks and cemeteries, should be preserved to mark the human cost of the conflict. The article also suggests that military bases named after Confederate generals should be renamed, as it will become increasingly difficult to ask African-American soldiers to serve at bases named after those who fought to keep them enslaved. Ultimately, the article concludes that Confederate statues should be removed, but lawfully, not through mob action.
