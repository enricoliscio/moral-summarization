Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about Confederate statues and the debate around their removal. The author is clearly against the statues, arguing they represent a flawed history and are offensive to African Americans.

First, I should identify the main points. The author mentions that Confederate statues are being targeted, with some being defaced or removed. President Trump and conservatives support keeping them, valuing tradition. The author argues that these statues should be reevaluated and often removed because they symbolize a dishonest view of the Confederacy, which was based on slavery.

I need to capture the moral argument here: the statues are offensive and don't represent the true history, especially since the Confederacy was about slavery. The author also distinguishes between different types of memorials, like military bases and cemeteries, suggesting some should stay but others should be moved to museums.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it reflects the author's stance against the statues while acknowledging the need for lawful removal and preserving some historical contexts.

Let me structure it: start with the debate, mention the author's position against the statues, explain why (slavery, offensive), note the conservative viewpoint, then the author's nuanced approach about where they should go, and conclude with the moral stance.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

Wait, the user provided an example response. Let me check that to make sure I'm on the right track. The example is a good summary, so I can follow that structure but make sure it's in my own words and captures all necessary points without exceeding 200 words.

I think I have a clear plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
