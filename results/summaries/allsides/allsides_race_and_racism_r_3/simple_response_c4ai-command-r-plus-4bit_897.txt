SUMMARY: Confederate statues and symbols are facing increased scrutiny and calls for removal as part of a broader movement to address racial injustice in the United States. While some, including President Donald Trump, argue in favor of preserving these monuments as part of our heritage, others view them as an unnecessary affront to Black citizens. The context in which many of these statues were erected, as part of an effort to promote a sanitized version of the Confederacy, cannot be ignored.

Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to recognize the human cost of the Civil War. However, statues of Confederate leaders, such as the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Virginia, serve only to glorify individuals who committed treason and sought to destroy the American nation. The removal of these statues does not entail destroying our history but rather reevaluating and reconsidering the values we choose to honor and preserve. It is important that the removal of these statues be done lawfully and not through acts of vandalism or mob action. By removing these statues, we send a clear message that we reject the viciously flawed cause of the Confederacy and its defense of chattel slavery. END OF SUMMARY.
