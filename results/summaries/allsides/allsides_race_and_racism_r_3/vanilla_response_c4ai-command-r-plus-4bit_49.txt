SUMMARY: The removal of Confederate statues and symbols has sparked debate, with some defending their preservation while others advocate for their removal or relocation. The statues are seen by many as a painful reminder of the defense of chattel slavery and the Confederacy's traitorous act of secession. The context of their creation and their role in perpetuating a glorified image of the Confederacy are important considerations. While direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved, large statues in prominent public spaces that glorify the Confederacy should be relocated to museums or battlefields. The names of military bases honoring Confederate generals are particularly contentious, given the increasing awareness of their historical context. The removal of these statues and symbols should be done lawfully, with distinctions made between different types of monuments. The preservation of Confederate statues is a mistake, as they represent a flawed and traitorous cause that should not be celebrated. 

END OF SUMMARY.
