SUMMARY:

The Confederate statues and symbols deserve to be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens who shouldn't have to see defenders of chattel slavery put on a pedestal. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and the South's leaders don't deserve to be given a place of honor. Many of the statues were erected to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy. The Confederate flag should be shunned as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of a terrible conflict. However, big statues in prominent public spaces erected to make a point about the supposed glories of the Confederacy should be transferred elsewhere, ideally to museums or battlefields, in a lawful manner, not via mob action. The Richmond statue of Lee, a symbol of the Lost Cause mythology, has long been a point of contention and should be removed.

END OF SUMMARY.
