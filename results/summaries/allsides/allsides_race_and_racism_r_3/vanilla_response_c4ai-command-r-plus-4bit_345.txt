SUMMARY: In the wake of recent events, there has been a wave of cancellations across America, with Confederate statues being particularly targeted. While President Trump and conservatives have defended the statues as part of our heritage, others argue that they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and should be reevaluated and removed. The context of their creation and the dishonest narrative they promote about the Confederacy are important considerations. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to mark the human cost of the conflict, but large statues in prominent public spaces should be transferred to museums or battlefields through lawful means. The removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, Virginia, is symbolic of this movement, as it was part of a cult that glorified the Confederacy and ignored the true cause of the Civil War: slavery. Secession was a traitorous act, and the leaders of the Confederacy do not deserve places of honor in our landscape. While vandalism is not the answer, Confederate statues should be removed and their legacy reexamined.
END OF SUMMARY.
