SUMMARY:

The article argues that Confederate statues and symbols should be reevaluated and often removed, as they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens and glorify a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation. The statues were often erected to promote a dishonest, romanticized version of the Confederacy. While learning about historical figures like Robert E. Lee doesn't require giant statues, direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved. The Confederate flag should be shunned, and military bases named after Confederate generals should be reconsidered. The article criticizes President Trump and conservatives who defend these symbols, fearing that removing them will lead to a slippery slope of "woke iconoclasm." Instead, the article advocates for a nuanced approach, distinguishing between symbols that promote a flawed cause and those that mark the human cost of a terrible conflict.
