SUMMARY:

The removal of Confederate statues and symbols is a necessary step in reevaluating our nation's history. These monuments were often erected to promote a distorted, glorified version of the Confederacy and slavery. They are an affront to black citizens, who should not have to see defenders of chattel slavery honored. While learning about historical figures like Robert E. Lee doesn't require giant statues, direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead should be preserved to acknowledge the human cost of the conflict. However, symbols like the Confederate flag, which represent a viciously flawed cause, should be shunned. The names of military bases named after Confederate generals should also be reexamined, as they may become increasingly offensive to African-American soldiers. Ultimately, secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, and its leaders do not deserve a place of honor in our landscape.

END OF SUMMARY.
