Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Va. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about how Confederate statues are being targeted, with some being vandalized or removed. President Trump supports keeping them, and conservatives are against removing them, fearing it's the start of a slippery slope where other historical figures might be targeted. The author argues that Confederate statues should be reevaluated and often removed because they represent a flawed cause, especially since they were erected to glorify the Confederacy in a dishonest way.

I should make sure the summary captures the moral argument against these statues. The author mentions that they offend black citizens and that the context of their creation is importantâ€”they were part of a movement to beautify the Confederacy. Also, the article differentiates between different types of memorials, like flags versus cemeteries, and mentions military bases named after Confederates, which are harder to address.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and include the key points: the removal of Confederate statues, the moral argument against them, the context of their creation, and the distinction between different types of memorials. I should also mention the opposition from Trump and conservatives, their fear of a slippery slope, and the author's stance that these statues should be moved to museums or battlefields rather than left in public spaces.

Wait, the user also specified that I should return the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I need to structure it accordingly. Let me make sure I include all these elements concisely without exceeding the word limit.

I think I have all the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and captures the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY: The article argues against the preservation of Confederate statues, asserting that they symbolize a flawed and dishonest version of history. These monuments, including the Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, Va., were erected to glorify the Confederacy and its defenders of slavery, causing unnecessary offense to Black citizens. The author criticizes the conservative defense of such symbols, warning that they perpetuate a false narrative about the Civil War and its causes. Confederate statues should be reevaluated and often removed, as their presence in prominent public spaces undermines the dignity of those who suffered under slavery. While some memorials, like Confederate cemeteries, should be preserved to honor the human cost of the war, symbols like the Confederate flag and statues should be retired to museums. The article also questions the naming of military bases after Confederate generals, noting the discomfort this may cause for African-American soldiers. The author emphasizes that the Confederacy's legacy, rooted in treason and slavery, does not deserve a place of honor in American society. END OF SUMMARY.
