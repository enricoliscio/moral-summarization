Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Alabama's abortion ban, but I also have to identify all the morally framed words first. Let me start by reading through the article carefully.

The article talks about the Alabama Senate passing a strict abortion ban. They mention that the bill was passed by a 25-6 margin, which is a significant majority. The bill would ban almost all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, except when the mother's life is at risk. The punishment for performing an abortion is 10 to 99 years in prison, which seems really harsh. They also note that the bill was tabled earlier due to a shouting match, which shows some tension in the Senate.

The supporters of the bill, like State Rep. Terri Collins, are hoping this will lead to a Supreme Court challenge to overturn Roe v. Wade. They removed exceptions for rape and incest to make the law strong enough for a court battle. Other states have similar laws, but Alabama's is the most restrictive.

Pro-choice groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, are condemning the bill. They argue that it criminalizes women and doctors, and they're worried about the current Supreme Court's stance on Roe v. Wade, especially with Justice Kavanaugh on the bench. They mention that women were dismissed as hysterical when fighting Kavanaugh's nomination, but now they're facing real threats to abortion rights.

So, for the first step, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. Let me go through the article again and pick out those words.

- Bans: Imposes restrictions, limiting freedom.
- Criminalizing: Turning a legal act into a crime.
- Punishing: Imposing penalties, which is a moral judgment.
- Opposing: Expressing disapproval.
- Restrictive: Limiting options, seen as controlling.
- Empathizing: Showing concern for others' feelings.
- Demeaning: Belittling or degrading.
- Dismissing: Undermining others' concerns.
- Propelling: Encouraging or driving towards a goal, which can be seen as pushing an agenda.
- Upholding: Supporting a principle, which can be moral.
- Protecting: Safeguarding, a positive moral action.
- Outlawing: Making something illegal, a strong moral stance.

Now, for the summary, I need to include as many of these words as possible while keeping it concise. I'll make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like the punishment, criminalizing, restrictive nature, and the opposing views from pro-choice groups. I'll also mention the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade and the reactions from both sides.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include the key points: the bill's passage, its strictness, the supporters' intentions, the opposition's concerns, and the implications for women and doctors.

Let me structure it: Start with the bill passing, its provisions, the punishment, the Senate's previous action, the supporters' goal, the state's restrictive law compared to others, the pro-choice group's condemnation, their concerns about the Supreme Court, and the impact on women and doctors.

I think that covers all the main points with the moral framing intact.

**Summary:**

The Alabama Senate passed a stringent abortion ban, criminalizing nearly all procedures, including those resulting from rape and incest, with severe penalties for providers. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court, while opponents, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, condemn the law as punitive and restrictive, fearing it endangers women's rights. The bill's harshness and the political climate highlight a moral conflict over reproductive rights.
