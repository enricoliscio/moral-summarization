Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The Alabama Senate passed a bill that bans nearly all abortions, sending it to the governor. The bill doesn't allow exceptions for rape or incest, only for saving the mother's life. The punishment for performing an abortion is 10 to 99 years in prison. The bill was previously tabled due to a heated argument when the rape and incest exceptions were removed. Proponents want this to challenge Roe v. Wade. Sixteen states have similar restrictions, but Alabama's is the most restrictive. Pro-choice groups are upset, fearing the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade. They're critical of Republicans not respecting the law or women. The article also mentions Brett Kavanaugh and the impact of Trump's nominees on the Supreme Court.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral perspective. The article presents the pro-choice side's perspective, so the summary should reflect that. I should mention the bill's strictness, the lack of exceptions, the punishment, the intention to challenge Roe v. Wade, the pro-choice criticism, and the political implications with Kavanaugh.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes all these elements. I should start by stating the bill's passage, its strictness, the exceptions, the punishment, the political intent, the criticism from pro-choice groups, and the reference to Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court.

Let me structure it: first, the bill's passage and details. Then, the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade. Next, the criticism from NARAL and their concerns about the Supreme Court. Finally, the political context with Kavanaugh.

I should avoid any personal opinions, just present the facts with the moral framing as given. Make sure it's clear that the pro-choice side is upset about the restrictions and the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Alright, putting it all together, keeping it within the word limit and the required structure.
