Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Alabama's abortion ban. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying the Alabama Senate passed a bill that almost completely bans abortions. It went to Governor Kay Ivey, who hasn't said if she'll sign it. The bill passed 25-6. It bans abortions in almost all cases, including rape and incest, only allowing it to save a mother's life. Doctors could face 10-99 years in prison, but the woman won't be charged.

There was a shouting match last week when an exception for rape and incest was removed. Proponents want this to challenge Roe v. Wade. The sponsor, Terri Collins, says she empathizes but wants a strong law to force a Supreme Court battle. Sixteen states have similar heartbeat laws, but Alabama's is the most restrictive.

A Democratic senator, Vivian Figures, urged people to leave Alabama. NARAL Pro-Choice America condemned the bill, saying it's a total ban and criminalizes women and doctors. They're worried about the Supreme Court's current makeup, especially after Kavanaugh's nomination, which was opposed by many women.

So, the summary needs to include the key points: the bill's passage, its strictness, the exceptions removed, the potential Supreme Court challenge, reactions from both sides, and the comparison to other states.

I should make sure it's under 200 words and starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll need to condense each point without losing the main ideas.

SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a near-total abortion ban, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey for approval. The bill, passed 25-6, prohibits abortions in nearly all cases, including rape and incest, with exceptions only to save a mother’s life. Doctors performing abortions could face 10-99 years in prison, while patients would not be charged. The bill was briefly tabled due to a floor dispute over removing rape and incest exceptions. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade, with sponsor Terri Collins stating the strict law could force a Supreme Court battle. Alabama’s law is the most restrictive in the U.S., with 16 states considering similar heartbeat bans. State Sen. Vivian Figures urged residents to leave Alabama, while NARAL Pro-Choice America condemned the bill, warning it criminalizes abortion and risks Roe v. Wade under the current Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
