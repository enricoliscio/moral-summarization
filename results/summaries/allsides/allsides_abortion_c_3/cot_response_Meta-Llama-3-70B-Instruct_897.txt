SUMMARY:
The Alabama Senate has passed a "dangerous" and "demeaning" legislation that bans nearly all abortions in the state, including for victims of rape and incest. The bill, which is the most restrictive abortion law in the country, would punish anyone performing an abortion with 10 to 99 years in prison. The legislation's proponents hope to set up a Supreme Court battle to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, have condemned the vote, expressing concern that the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk. The group's president, Ilyse Hogue, described the law as a "total ban on abortion, criminalizing the act and punishing women and doctors." The law's passage has sparked outrage, with some calling it an "alarming" attack on women's rights. END OF SUMMARY.
