SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed extreme legislation that *bans* abortion in almost all cases, including for *victims* of rape and incest. The bill's *proponents* hope it will spark a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. This is part of a wider trend of *restrictions* on abortion rights, with sixteen states having passed or considering so-called "heartbeat bills." Alabama's law is the most *restrictive* in the country, and criminalizes doctors who perform abortions. *Pro-abortion* rights groups have *condemned* the bill, calling out the *anti-choice* agenda of Republicans and the risk it poses to women's rights. The current makeup of the Supreme Court, with Trump's *alarming* nominees, heightens concerns about the potential for *criminalizing* abortion and *demeaning* women. Women's rights activists were previously dismissed as *hysterical* for warning about these dangers during the Kavanaugh nomination process. END OF SUMMARY.
