SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill that would ban abortions in nearly all instances, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a motherâ€™s life. The bill's proponents hope to force a federal court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion. State Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, empathized with survivors of rape and incest but intentionally left out exceptions to strengthen the law for a court battle. The bill would punish those performing abortions with 10 to 99 years in prison, while those undergoing the procedure would not face criminal charges. The bill passed by a margin of 25-6 and is now on Gov. Kay Ivey's desk for signature. Pro-abortion rights groups have condemned the bill, expressing concern that the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk. They argue that the bill criminalizes abortion and punishes women, while Republicans applaud and show no respect for the law or the women it protects.
