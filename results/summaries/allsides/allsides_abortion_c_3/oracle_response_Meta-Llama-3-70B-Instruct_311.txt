SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a highly restrictive abortion ban, sending it to Governor Kay Ivey's desk to be signed into law. The legislation, which passed with a 25-6 margin, would criminalize nearly all abortions in the state, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother's life. Anyone performing an abortion could be punished by 10 to 99 years in prison. The bill's proponents aim to force a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. State Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, empathized with survivors of rape and incest but intentionally left out exceptions to ensure a federal court battle. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, condemn the law as "dangerous and demeaning," accusing anti-choice Republicans of no longer respecting the law or the women it protects. The law's passage has sparked outrage, with some warning that it will lead to women being punished and doctors being criminalized.
