SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a highly controversial bill that bans abortions in nearly all cases, including for victims of rape and incest. The bill, which now heads to Gov. Kay Ivey's desk for approval, has sparked outrage and concern among pro-abortion rights groups and Democrats. The bill's proponents argue that it is designed to force a federal court battle and challenge the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. With no exceptions for rape or incest, the bill criminalizes abortion and punishes doctors, while those undergoing the procedure would face no charges. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, expressed empathy for survivors of sexual assault but maintained that the exceptions were intentionally omitted to strengthen the law for a federal challenge. Sixteen states have passed or are considering similar abortion bans, but Alabama's is by far the most restrictive. Pro-abortion rights advocates worry that the current makeup of the Supreme Court, following the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, puts Roe v. Wade at significant risk. The bill has been criticized for punishing women and doctors, with opponents arguing that it criminalizes abortion and demeans women.
