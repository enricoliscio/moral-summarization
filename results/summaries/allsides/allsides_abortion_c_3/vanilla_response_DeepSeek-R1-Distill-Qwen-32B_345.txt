Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Alabama's Senate passing a bill that bans nearly all abortions. The bill went to the governor, Kay Ivey, who hasn't said if she'll sign it yet. The bill passed 25-6, which is a significant majority.

The key points are that the bill would ban abortions in almost all cases, including for rape and incest victims. The only exception is if the mother's life is in danger. The penalties for performing an abortion are severe—10 to 99 years in prison. But the person getting the abortion isn't charged.

The bill was tabled last week because of a shouting match when the rape and incest exceptions were removed. The supporters want this to challenge Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court. State Rep. Terri Collins sponsored it and said she removed exceptions to make the law strong enough for a court battle.

Alabama's law is the most restrictive in the country. Other states have passed heartbeat laws, but Alabama's is more extreme. Some senators and pro-choice groups are criticizing the law, saying it's demeaning and puts Roe v. Wade at risk, especially with the current Supreme Court composition.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the Senate passing the bill, the vote margin, and the主要内容—banning almost all abortions, exceptions, penalties. Then, the context about the Supreme Court challenge and reactions from both sides. Make sure to include the most restrictive aspect and the criticism from pro-choice groups.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce the bill, its provisions, the context of the vote, the supporters' intentions, the law's restrictiveness, and the reactions. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
