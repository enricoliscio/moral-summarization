SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed legislation that would ban abortions in nearly all cases, including for victims of rape and incest, and only allow it to save a mother's life. The bill's proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, empathized with survivors but deliberately excluded exceptions to force a federal court battle. Sixteen states are pushing for similar abortion bans, but Alabama's is the most restrictive, with penalties of up to 99 years in prison for providers. Pro-choice advocates are concerned that the current Supreme Court makeup endangers Roe v. Wade, as predicted during the Kavanaugh nomination process. They condemn the Alabama bill as criminalizing abortion, punishing women, and demeaning those who stood against it.
END OF SUMMARY.
