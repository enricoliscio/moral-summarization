Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Alabama passing a restrictive abortion bill. Let me read through the article first.

The article says the Alabama Senate passed legislation banning nearly all abortions, sending it to the governor. It's a 25-6 vote. The bill would make abortion illegal in almost all cases, including rape and incest, except to save the mother's life. Penalties for performing abortions are 10 to 99 years in prison, but no charges against the woman. They had to table it last week because of a shouting match after removing the rape and incest exception. The sponsors want to challenge Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court. Sixteen states are considering similar bans, and Alabama's is the most restrictive. Pro-choice groups are worried, especially about the Supreme Court's current makeup. NARAL Pro-Choice America condemned the bill, saying it criminalizes abortion and punishes women and doctors.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the main points: Alabama Senate passes near-total abortion ban, sent to the governor, exceptions only for life-saving. Penalties for providers. The bill was controversial, leading to a shouting match when exceptions were removed. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade. Alabama's law is the most restrictive. Pro-choice groups criticize, worried about Supreme Court overturning Roe. 

I should make sure to include the key elements: who, what, when, where, why, and the reactions. Also, mention the implications for the Supreme Court and the comparison to other states. Keep it concise and clear.
