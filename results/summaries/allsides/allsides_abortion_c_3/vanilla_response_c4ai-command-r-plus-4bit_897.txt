SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill banning almost all abortions in the state, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey to sign into law. The bill, which passed by a 25-6 margin, includes no exceptions for rape and incest and would punish providers with up to 99 years in prison. Proponents hope the bill will lead to a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, said she empathized with survivors of rape and incest but intentionally left out exceptions to strengthen the law for a federal court battle. Alabama's bill is the most restrictive abortion law in the country, and pro-abortion rights groups have strongly condemned it, expressing concern about the current makeup of the Supreme Court and the potential risk to Roe v. Wade. The bill's passage reflects a broader trend of states passing abortion restrictions, with sixteen states having passed or considering similar bans.
