SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a despicable and abhorrent piece of legislation that bans abortions in nearly all cases, even for victims of rape and incest. This draconian measure, which rightfully faces strong opposition from pro-choice advocates, would punish doctors who perform abortions with up to 99 years in prison. The bill's sponsors intentionally omitted exceptions for rape and incest to force a federal court battle, aiming to challenge the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Sixteen states have passed or are considering similar abortion bans, but Alabama's is the most restrictive. Pro-choice advocates are rightly concerned that the current conservative-leaning Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade, endangering women's reproductive rights and bodily autonomy. This is a shameful and regressive move by the Alabama Senate, and a blatant attack on women's fundamental rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
