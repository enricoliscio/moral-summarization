Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Alabama's abortion ban. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The Alabama Senate passed a bill that almost completely bans abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. It only allows abortions to save a mother's life. The penalties for performing an abortion are severeâ€”10 to 99 years in prison. The bill was debated, and there was a shouting match when exceptions for rape and incest were removed. Proponents want this to challenge Roe v. Wade. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Terri Collins, said they removed exceptions to make the law strong enough for a Supreme Court battle. Alabama's law is the most restrictive in the country. Some senators, like Sen. Vivian Figures, are worried about the impact on women. Pro-abortion rights groups like NARAL are condemning the law, saying it's a total ban and criminalizes women. They're concerned about the Supreme Court's current makeup, especially after Trump's nominees, like Brett Kavanaugh, who they see as a threat to Roe v. Wade.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral framing. The article presents the issue from a pro-choice perspective, highlighting the restrictive nature of the law and its impact on women. I should include the main points: the bill's passage, its restrictions, the removal of exceptions, the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade, the penalties, reactions from both sides, and the context of other states' laws.

I should structure the summary to first state what happened, then the specifics of the bill, the intent behind it, the reactions from supporters and opponents, and the broader implications. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all key elements.

Let me draft it step by step:

1. Start with the Alabama Senate passing the bill, sent to the governor.
2. Describe the bill's restrictions: bans almost all abortions, including rape and incest, only allows to save mother's life.
3. Penalties for providers: 10-99 years in prison.
4. The bill was tabled earlier due to a shouting match when exceptions were removed.
5. Proponents' goal: challenge Roe v. Wade.
6. Sponsor's statement: removed exceptions to strengthen the law for court battle.
7. Context: 16 states considering similar laws, Alabama's is most restrictive.
8. Opposing views: Sen. Figures and NARAL's condemnation.
9. Concerns about Supreme Court and Kavanaugh's influence.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and captures the moral perspectives presented, especially the opposition's viewpoint that the law is harsh and targets women. I should avoid any bias beyond what's in the article but present both sides as they're presented.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's under 200. Also, I need to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and make sure the summary is after the "SUMMARY:" token.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a near-total abortion ban, excluding cases of rape, incest, and life-saving procedures, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey for approval. The bill, which would impose 10-99 year prison sentences on providers, was contentious due to the removal of exceptions for rape and incest. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade, with sponsor Rep. Terri Collins stating the law's strictness is intentional to provoke a Supreme Court battle. Critics, including state Sen. Vivian Figures and NARAL Pro-Choice America, condemn the law as punitive and harmful, fearing it could set a precedent under the current Supreme Court's conservative lean, especially with Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The law, the most restrictive in the U.S., sparks fears of a rollback on abortion rights. END OF SUMMARY.
