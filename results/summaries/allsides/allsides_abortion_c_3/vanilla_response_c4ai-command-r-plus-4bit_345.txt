SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill that bans nearly all abortions in the state, with only a mother's life being an exception. The bill passed with a 25-6 margin and will be sent to Gov. Kay Ivey to be signed into law. The bill's proponents aim to challenge the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, said that the exceptions for rape and incest were left out to ensure the law would be strong enough to force a federal court battle. Alabama's abortion law is the most restrictive in the country, and pro-abortion rights groups have condemned the vote, expressing concern about the risk to Roe v. Wade with the current makeup of the Supreme Court. The bill would punish those performing abortions with 10 to 99 years in prison but would not charge the person undergoing the procedure. Critics argue that the bill is dangerous and demeaning, criminalizing abortion and punishing women.
