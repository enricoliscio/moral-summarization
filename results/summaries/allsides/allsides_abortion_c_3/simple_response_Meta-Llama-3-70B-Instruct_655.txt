SUMMARY:

In a disturbing display of disregard for women's rights and bodily autonomy, the Alabama Senate has passed a draconian law that bans nearly all abortions in the state, with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest. The legislation, which would punish doctors who perform abortions with up to 99 years in prison, is a blatant attempt to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The bill's proponents have openly admitted that their goal is to spark a Supreme Court battle, revealing a callous disregard for the well-being of women and girls who would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. The law is a cruel and dangerous attack on women's fundamental human rights, and its passage is a stark reminder of the erosion of reproductive freedom in the United States.

END OF SUMMARY.
