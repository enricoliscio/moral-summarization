Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned they are a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical aspects presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Alabama Senate passed a strict abortion ban, which is almost a complete prohibition except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. They removed exceptions for rape and incest, which is a significant moral point because it affects vulnerable individuals.

The bill's supporters want to challenge Roe v. Wade, which is a major ethical and legal issue. They believe this law will lead to a Supreme Court case that could overturn the landmark decision. This shows their stance on the morality of abortion and their strategy to influence national law.

Opponents, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, are concerned about the impact on women's rights and the potential for punishing women and doctors. They see this as a demeaning law and a threat to Roe v. Wade, highlighting the moral conflict between states' rights and federal protections.

I need to capture both sides: the pro-life perspective aiming for a legal battle and the pro-choice perspective worrying about women's rights and the consequences of such a restrictive law. I should also mention the potential for prison sentences for providers and the political implications with the Supreme Court's current composition.

I'll structure the summary to include the passage of the bill, its restrictions, the supporters' intentions, the opposition's concerns, and the broader implications for abortion rights in the U.S. Keeping it under 200 words while conveying the moral dimensions is key.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sides and the potential legal and societal impacts. I'll avoid taking sides but present the ethical perspectives clearly.

SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a near-total abortion ban, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey for approval. The bill prohibits abortions in nearly all cases, including for rape and incest survivors, allowing exceptions only to save a mother’s life. Providers could face 10 to 99 years in prison, while patients would not be penalized. Proponents, including sponsor Rep. Terri Collins, aim to challenge Roe v. Wade by creating a Supreme Court case. Opponents, like Sen. Vivian Figures and NARAL Pro-Choice America, criticize the law as punitive and demeaning to women, warning it risks Roe v. Wade’s future. The bill reflects a broader national trend of restrictive abortion laws, with Alabama’s being the most extreme. END OF SUMMARY.
