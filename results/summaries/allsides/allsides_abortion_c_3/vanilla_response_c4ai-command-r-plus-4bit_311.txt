SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill banning nearly all abortions in the state, sending it to Governor Ivey's desk for approval. The bill would prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest, with exceptions only to save the mother's life. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, acknowledged the impact on survivors of sexual assault but argued that exceptions were excluded to strengthen the law for a federal court battle. Sixteen states have or are considering similar abortion bans, but Alabama's is the most restrictive. Pro-abortion rights groups have criticized the bill, expressing concern about the risk to Roe v. Wade with the current Supreme Court makeup. They argue that the bill criminalizes abortion and punishes women and doctors, highlighting the contrast with the stated respect for settled law during the Kavanaugh nomination.
