SUMMARY:
The Alabama Senate has passed a highly restrictive abortion law, banning nearly all abortions in the state, including for victims of rape and incest. The law, which would punish anyone performing an abortion with 10 to 99 years in prison, is considered "dangerous" and "demeaning" by pro-abortion rights groups. The legislation's proponents hope to spark a Supreme Court battle that would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Critics argue that the law is a "total ban on abortion" that "criminalizes" and "punishes" women and doctors. The law's passage has sparked outrage, with opponents calling it an "alarming" attack on women's rights. The move is seen as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, which is now at risk due to the current makeup of the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
