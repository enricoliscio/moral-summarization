Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Alabama passing a strict abortion ban. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The Alabama Senate passed a bill that almost completely bans abortions, except to save a mother's life. It includes cases of rape and incest, which is pretty restrictive. The bill passed 25-6, and it's now with the governor, Kay Ivey, who hasn't said if she'll sign it yet. The penalties for performing an abortion are 10 to 99 years in prison, but the person getting the abortion isn't charged. There was a shouting match last week when the rape and incest exceptions were removed, causing a delay. The supporters want this to challenge Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court. Sixteen states are considering similar laws, but Alabama's is the most restrictive. Pro-choice groups are upset, saying it's a dangerous law and that women are being punished. They also mention the recent Supreme Court changes making Roe v. Wade at risk.

So, the main points are:
- Alabama Senate passed a near-total abortion ban.
- Exceptions only for saving the mother's life, no exceptions for rape/incest.
- Severe penalties for providers, none for patients.
- Bill was delayed due to a shouting match when exceptions were removed.
- Supporters aim to challenge Roe v. Wade.
- Alabama's law is the most restrictive, part of a trend in 16 states.
- Pro-choice groups condemn the law, worried about Supreme Court impact.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should make sure to include all key points without getting too detailed.
