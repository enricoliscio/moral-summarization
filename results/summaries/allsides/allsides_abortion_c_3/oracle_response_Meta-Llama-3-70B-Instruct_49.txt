SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a legislation that bans nearly all abortions in the state, including for victims of rape and incest, with the sole exception being when the mother's life is at risk. This restrictive law, which would punish anyone performing an abortion with 10 to 99 years in prison, aims to set up a Supreme Court battle to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The bill's proponents, like State Rep. Terri Collins, claim to empathize with survivors of rape and incest but deliberately left out exceptions to force a federal court battle. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, condemn the law as "criminalizing" and "punishing" women and doctors, and accuse anti-choice Republicans of no longer respecting the law or the women it protects. The law's passage has sparked outrage, with some calling it "dangerous" and "demeaning".
