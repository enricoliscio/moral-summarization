SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a bill banning nearly all abortions in the state, with a 25-6 margin. The bill would only allow abortions to save a mother's life and would punish anyone performing an abortion with 10-99 years in prison. The legislation does not include exceptions for rape and incest, and its proponents hope it will lead to a Supreme Court battle to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The bill is considered the most restrictive abortion law in the country, and critics argue it will force women to leave the state. The pro-abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America has condemned the vote, expressing concern that the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk. The bill now heads to Governor Kay Ivey's desk for signature.
