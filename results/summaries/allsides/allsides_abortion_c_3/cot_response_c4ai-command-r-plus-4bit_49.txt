SUMMARY: 
The Alabama Senate passed legislation that would ban abortions in nearly all instances, including for victims of rape and incest. The bill, which now heads to Gov. Ivey's desk for approval, would impose harsh punishments on those performing abortions, with proponents hoping to spark a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. This bill is part of a wider trend of abortion restrictions and so-called "heartbeat laws" in several states. Sixteen states have passed or are considering similar bans. The bill has been criticized by pro-abortion rights groups, who argue that it criminalizes abortion, demeans women, and punishes doctors. They fear that with the current makeup of the Supreme Court, Roe v. Wade is at risk of being overturned. This legislation represents a worrying trend of anti-choice measures that seek to outlaw abortion, with potentially devastating consequences for women's rights and reproductive freedom.
