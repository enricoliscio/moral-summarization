SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill that would ban almost all abortions in the state, with only an exception to save the mother's life. This legislation criminalizes abortion, punishing doctors with up to 99 years in prison while not charging the person undergoing the procedure. The bill's proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion, by setting up a Supreme Court battle. State Representative Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, empathized with victims of rape and incest but intentionally left out exceptions to strengthen the law for a federal court fight. Sixteen states are pushing similar abortion restrictions, with Alabama's being the most restrictive. Pro-abortion rights groups condemned the bill, expressing concern about the risk to Roe v. Wade with the current Supreme Court makeup. They criticized Republicans for applauding the bill, which punishes women and doctors, and for their promise to nominate justices committed to outlawing abortion.
