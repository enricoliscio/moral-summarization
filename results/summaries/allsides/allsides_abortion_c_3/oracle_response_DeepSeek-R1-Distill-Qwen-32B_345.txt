Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The Alabama Senate passed a strict abortion ban, almost criminalizing all abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. The bill only allows abortions to save the mother's life. The supporters hope this will challenge Roe v. Wade. The author used words like "victims," "rape," "empathized," "criminalizing," etc., which I need to include in the summary.

I should start by identifying the key elements: the bill's passage, its restrictions, the supporters' intentions, the reactions from both sides, and the moral implications. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the specified moral words as possible.

I'll structure the summary to mention the bill passing, the strictness, the lack of exceptions, the punishment for providers, the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade, the emotional reactions, and the criticism from pro-choice groups. I'll use the moral words where appropriate, like "victims," "rape," "empathized," "criminalizing," "punishing," "stood," "applauded," "wept," "outlawing."

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear, ensuring the moral framing is evident. Let me draft this step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary elements and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The Alabama Senate passed legislation banning nearly all abortions, including for victims of rape and incest, with only exceptions to save a mother’s life. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade, with sponsor Rep. Terri Collins empathizing with survivors but prioritizing a strong law to provoke a federal court battle. The bill, which would criminalize abortion providers with 10-99 years in prison, faced backlash as state Sen. Vivian Figures urged women to leave Alabama. Pro-abortion rights groups condemned the measure, calling it demeaning and a threat to Roe v. Wade. NARAL Pro-Choice America criticized the law, noting Republicans applauded while women wept, highlighting the promise to outlaw abortion and punish women. The bill reflects a broader trend of restrictive abortion laws, with Alabama’s being the most extreme. END OF SUMMARY.
