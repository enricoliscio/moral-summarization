Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Alabama Senate passed a strict abortion ban, removing exceptions for rape and incest. The bill now goes to the governor. Proponents want to challenge Roe v. Wade, while opponents are concerned about the implications. The article mentions the moral implications, like criminalizing abortion and the emotional reactions from both sides.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key points: the passage of the bill, the removal of exceptions for rape and incest, the potential for a Supreme Court battle, and the reactions from both supporters and opponents. Using words like "victims," "criminalizing," "punishing," "empathized," "passed," "stood," "applauded," "wept," etc., will help maintain the moral tone.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the bill's passage, then mention the exceptions removed, the penalties, and the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade. Then, I'll include the reactions from both sides, using the moral language to convey their stances. Finally, I'll note the concerns about the Supreme Court and the impact on women's rights.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral terms without making it too wordy. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Also, I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting from the bill's passage, its provisions, the intent, and then the reactions and implications.

After drafting, I'll review to make sure all key points are covered and that the moral framing is preserved. I'll also ensure that the summary doesn't include any unnecessary details and sticks to the main points of the article.

SUMMARY:  
The Alabama Senate passed a near-total abortion ban, removing exceptions for rape and incest, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey for signature. The bill criminalizes abortion in nearly all cases, allowing it only to save a mother’s life, with penalties of 10 to 99 years for providers. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade, while critics condemn the law as punitive and demeaning. State Rep. Terri Collins empathized with victims of rape and incest but removed exceptions to strengthen the law for a federal court battle. Pro-abortion rights groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, warned the law risks Roe v. Wade, with women weeping as Republicans applauded its passage. The bill reflects a broader trend of restrictive abortion laws, with Alabama’s being the most extreme. Opponents fear it sets a dangerous precedent, criminalizing abortion and punishing women, while supporters see it as a step toward overturning Roe v. Wade. END OF SUMMARY.
