SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill that would ban abortions in nearly all cases, including for victims of rape and incest. The bill, which passed by a 25-6 margin, would only permit abortions if necessary to save the mother's life. The bill's proponents aim to challenge the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, said that the exceptions for rape and incest were left out to ensure the law would be strong enough to force a federal court battle. Alabama's abortion law is the most restrictive in the country, and pro-abortion rights groups have condemned the bill. The bill now heads to Gov. Kay Ivey's desk for approval.

END OF SUMMARY.
