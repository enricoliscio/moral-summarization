SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill that would ban abortions in almost all cases, including for victims of rape and incest, with the intention of challenging Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court level. The bill, which now goes to the Governor's desk for approval, would impose harsh criminal penalties on abortion providers while exempting women who undergo the procedure. Supporters of the bill, such as State Rep. Terri Collins, argue that it is necessary to remove exceptions for rape and incest in order to create a strong legal challenge that could potentially overturn Roe v. Wade. Critics, including state Sen. Vivian Figures and NARAL Pro-Choice America, argue that the bill is a draconian measure that would force women to leave the state and that it represents a disturbing trend of anti-abortion legislation across the country, threatening women's rights and endangering their lives. The bill's passage highlights the ongoing moral and legal debate surrounding abortion and the potential consequences of a post-Roe v. Wade world.
