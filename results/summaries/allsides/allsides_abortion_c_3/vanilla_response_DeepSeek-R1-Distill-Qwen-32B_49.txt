Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Alabama's Senate passing a strict abortion ban. The bill would almost completely ban abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, with exceptions only to save a mother's life. The punishment for performing an abortion is 10 to 99 years in prison. 

The bill was tabled earlier due to a heated debate when exceptions for rape and incest were removed. Proponents want this to challenge Roe v. Wade. The sponsor, Terri Collins, mentioned leaving out exceptions to make the law strong enough for a court battle. 

Alabama's law is the most restrictive, with other states having heartbeat laws but not as strict. Pro-choice groups are worried about the Supreme Court's current makeup, especially with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. They're concerned about the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start with the main points: Alabama Senate passes near-total abortion ban, sends to governor, includes no exceptions except life-saving, severe penalties for providers, tabled earlier due to debate, purpose to challenge Roe v. Wade, most restrictive law, reactions from pro-choice groups, and the political implications with the Supreme Court.

I should make sure to include key details like the vote margin, the specific exceptions, the penalties, the tabled bill situation, the sponsor's reasoning, the comparison with other states, and the criticism from NARAL. Also, mention the concern about the Supreme Court and Kavanaugh.

Let me structure it: start with the bill passing, its provisions, the prior tabled situation, the intent to challenge Roe, comparison to other states, reactions from both sides, and the implications for the Supreme Court.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine related points. For example, mention the vote result and the provisions together. Then explain why the bill was tabled and the sponsor's reasoning. Then compare to other states' laws. Then the reactions, focusing on NARAL's concerns and the political angle with the Supreme Court.

I should avoid going into too much detail on each point, just hit the main highlights. Also, make sure to include the names of key people and organizations, like Terri Collins, NARAL, and Brett Kavanaugh.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and covers all the essential elements without getting too wordy.
