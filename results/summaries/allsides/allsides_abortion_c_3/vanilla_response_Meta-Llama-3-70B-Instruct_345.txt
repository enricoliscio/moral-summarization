SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that bans nearly all abortions in the state, with the exception of saving a mother's life. The bill, which passed with a 25-6 margin, would criminalize abortions and punish doctors who perform them with 10 to 99 years in prison. The legislation does not include exceptions for rape and incest, and its proponents hope it will lead to a Supreme Court battle that could overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The bill has been condemned by pro-abortion rights groups, who argue that it puts women's lives at risk and ignores the rights of survivors of rape and incest. The bill now heads to Governor Kay Ivey's desk, where it awaits her signature. If signed into law, Alabama's would be the most restrictive abortion law in the country.
