SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed legislation that would ban abortions in nearly all cases, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother’s life. The bill’s proponents say they hope the legislation will set up a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. State Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, said she empathized with survivors of rape and incest but that exceptions were left out to ensure the law would be strong enough to force a federal court battle. The bill would punish anyone performing an abortion with 10 to 99 years in prison, while no criminal charges would be filed against the person undergoing the procedure. Sixteen states have passed or are considering similar abortion bans, but Alabama’s is the most restrictive. Pro-abortion rights groups have condemned the bill, expressing concern that the current makeup of the Supreme Court puts Roe v. Wade at risk. They argue that the bill criminalizes abortion and punishes women, and that Republicans are not respecting the law or the women it protects.
