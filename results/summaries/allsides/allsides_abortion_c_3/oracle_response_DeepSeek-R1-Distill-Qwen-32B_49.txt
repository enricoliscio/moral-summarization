Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Alabama Senate passed a strict abortion ban, which is the most restrictive in the country. It removes exceptions for rape and incest, aiming to challenge Roe v. Wade. The article mentions the moral implications, like criminalizing abortion and the emotional reactions from both supporters and opponents.

I should identify the morally framed words used: victims, rape, incest, empathized, passed, criminalizing, punishing, pretend, stood, applauded, wept, promise, told, outlawing. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the bill's passage and its strictness. Then mention the exceptions removed, the punishment for providers, and the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade. Include Rep. Collins' empathy but focus on the law's strength. Note the 16 states with heartbeat laws and Alabama's uniqueness. Highlight the emotional reactions: senators applauding, women weeping. Conclude with NARAL's condemnation and the threat to Roe v. Wade.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, using the moral terms appropriately. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each point is covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a near-total abortion ban, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey for approval. The bill criminalizes nearly all abortions, including for victims of rape and incest, with only a life-saving exception. Proponents, like Rep. Terri Collins, aim to challenge Roe v. Wade by creating a strict law for a potential Supreme Court battle. The measure passed after a heated debate, with opponents like Sen. Vivian Figures urging residents to leave Alabama. Pro-abortion rights groups condemned the law, calling it demeaning and a threat to Roe v. Wade. The bill, which could punish providers with 10-99 years in prison, has sparked strong reactions: some stood and applauded, while others wept. This move follows a national trend of restrictive abortion laws, with Alabamaâ€™s being the most extreme. END OF SUMMARY.
