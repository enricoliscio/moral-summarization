SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that bans almost all abortions in the state, with the only exception being when the mother's life is at risk. This extreme measure, which even excludes cases of rape and incest, carries a harsh punishment of up to 99 years in prison for those who perform the procedure. The bill's proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion, by intentionally omitting exceptions for rape and incest in order to force a federal court battle. Sixteen states have passed or are considering similar abortion bans, but Alabama's is by far the most restrictive. This draconian law has sparked outrage and concern from pro-abortion rights groups, who fear that the current makeup of the Supreme Court, following the appointment of Trump's nominees, puts Roe v. Wade and women's reproductive rights at grave risk. The bill now awaits the signature of Governor Kay Ivey, who has not yet indicated whether she will sign it into law.

END OF SUMMARY.
