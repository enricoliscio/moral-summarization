SUMMARY: 
The Alabama Senate passed a bill that would ban abortions in almost all cases, including for victims of rape and incest, with the only exception being to save the mother's life. The bill's proponents are hoping that this legislation, along with similar abortion restrictions in other states, will lead to a Supreme Court battle that could overturn Roe v. Wade. The bill has been condemned by pro-abortion rights groups, who see it as a dangerous and demeaning attempt to criminalize abortion and punish women. They argue that this bill, and others like it, are part of a larger effort to roll back reproductive rights, especially in light of the appointment of conservative justices to the Supreme Court. With this new bill, Alabama has passed the most restrictive abortion law in the country, sparking concerns about the future of Roe v. Wade and the impact on women's rights.
