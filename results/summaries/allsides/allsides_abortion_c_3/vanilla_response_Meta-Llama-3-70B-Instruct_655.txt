SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that bans nearly all abortions in the state, with a 25-6 margin. The bill would only allow abortions if necessary to save a mother's life, and would punish anyone performing an abortion with 10 to 99 years in prison. The bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest victims. The legislation is seen as a challenge to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion. Proponents of the bill hope it will lead to a Supreme Court battle, while critics argue it will harm women's rights. The bill has been condemned by pro-abortion rights groups, who fear the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk. The bill now heads to Governor Kay Ivey's desk for signature.
