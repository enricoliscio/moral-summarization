SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a highly restrictive abortion ban, sending it to Governor Kay Ivey's desk to be signed into law. The legislation, which passed with a 25-6 margin, would criminalize nearly all abortions, including for victims of rape and incest, and punish those performing the procedure with up to 99 years in prison. The bill's proponents aim to force a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade, while opponents condemn the law as "dangerous and demeaning" to women. State Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, claims to empathize with survivors of rape and incest, but intentionally left out exceptions to make the law strong enough to spark a federal court battle. Critics argue that the law is a "total ban on abortion" that would punish women and doctors, and that the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk. The law has sparked outrage, with NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue stating that Republicans "no longer even pretend to respect the law or the women that it protects."
