SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a legislation that bans nearly all abortions in the state, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother's life. This restrictive law would criminalize abortions, punishing anyone performing the procedure with 10 to 99 years in prison. The bill's proponents aim to spark a Supreme Court battle to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, claims to empathize with survivors of rape and incest, but deliberately left out exceptions to force a federal court battle. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, condemn the law as "dangerous and demeaning," arguing it would punish women and doctors. The law's passage has sparked outrage, with some calling it a "total ban on abortion" that would force women to leave the state. The morally charged debate surrounding this law has sparked concerns about the erosion of women's rights and the rule of law.
