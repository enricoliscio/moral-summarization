Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and follow specific tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Alabama Senate passed a strict abortion ban, which would criminalize nearly all abortions, including those for rape and incest survivors. The bill is heading to the governor. Proponents want it to challenge Roe v. Wade. The article also mentions reactions from Democrats and pro-choice groups, who are concerned about the impact on women and the potential for Supreme Court changes.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided: victims, rape, incest, empathized, passed, criminalizing, punishing, pretend, stood, applauded, wept, promise, told, outlawing. I should use as many of these as possible without making the summary too wordy.

I'll start by mentioning the Alabama Senate passing the legislation, using "passed." Highlight that it bans nearly all abortions, including for rape and incest victims. Note that performing abortions could be punished with prison time, using "criminalizing" and "punishing." Mention that the bill was tabled due to a shouting match after removing exceptions, showing the controversy.

Include Rep. Terri Collins' statement about empathizing with victims but removing exceptions for a strong law to challenge the Supreme Court. Then, mention the 16 states with similar laws, emphasizing Alabama's strictness. Add state Sen. Vivian Figures' warning about leaving Alabama, showing opposition.

Include NARAL Pro-Choice America's condemnation, using "criminalizing" and "punishing," and their concern about the Supreme Court's stance on Roe v. Wade. Highlight their statement about Republicans applauding while women wept, using "applauded" and "wept." Finally, reference Brett Kavanaugh and the promise to nominate justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade, using "promise" and "outlawing."

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes all the key points with the moral framing words. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. Let me piece this together step by step, ensuring each moral word is appropriately placed without forcing them in awkwardly.

SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed legislation banning nearly all abortions, including for victims of rape and incest, with no exceptions except to save a mother’s life. Proponents aim to challenge Roe v. Wade, while opponents condemn the law as criminalizing and punishing women and doctors. The bill, which would impose 10-99 years in prison for performing abortions, was tabled last week amid controversy over removing rape and incest exceptions. State Rep. Terri Collins empathized with survivors but argued the law’s strength could force a Supreme Court battle. Sixteen states are considering similar bans, with Alabama’s being the most restrictive. Pro-abortion rights groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, condemned the vote, stating it disrespects women and the law. They warned that Republicans’ actions, including applauding the bill, ignore the emotional toll on women, who wept as the law passed. The current Supreme Court makeup, following Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation, raises concerns about outlawing abortion nationwide. END OF SUMMARY.
