SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that bans nearly all abortions in the state, sending it to Governor Kay Ivey's desk to be signed into law. The bill, which passed with a 25-6 margin, would ban abortions in almost all instances, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother's life. Those who perform an abortion could face 10 to 99 years in prison, while those who undergo the procedure would not face criminal charges. The bill's proponents hope it will lead to a Supreme Court battle that will overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The law is the most restrictive abortion law in the country, and pro-abortion rights groups have condemned the vote, expressing concern that the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk.
