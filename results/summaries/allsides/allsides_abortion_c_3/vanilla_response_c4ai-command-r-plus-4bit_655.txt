SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a bill that would ban abortions in nearly all cases, including for victims of rape and incest. The bill, which passed by a 25-6 margin, would only permit abortions if necessary to save the mother's life. The bill's proponents hope to set up a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. State Rep. Terri Collins, the bill's sponsor, said that she empathized with survivors of rape and incest but that exceptions were left out to ensure the law would be strong enough for a federal court battle. Sixteen states have passed or are considering similar abortion bans, but Alabama's is the most restrictive. Pro-abortion rights groups have condemned the bill, expressing concern that the current makeup of the Supreme Court puts Roe v. Wade at risk.
