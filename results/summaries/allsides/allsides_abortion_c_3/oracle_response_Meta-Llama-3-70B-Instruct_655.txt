SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a legislation that bans nearly all abortions in the state, criminalizing the act and punishing women and doctors. The bill, which passed with a 25-6 margin, would only permit abortions if necessary to save a mother's life, leaving out exceptions for victims of rape and incest. Anyone performing an abortion could face 10 to 99 years in prison. The bill's proponents hope to set up a Supreme Court battle to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. State Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, empathized with survivors of rape and incest but deliberately left out exceptions to force a federal court battle. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, have condemned the vote, expressing concern that the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk. The law has been called "dangerous and demeaning" and its passage has been met with tears and applause from opposing sides.

END OF SUMMARY.
