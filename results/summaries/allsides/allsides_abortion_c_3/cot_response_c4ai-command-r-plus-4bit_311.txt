SUMMARY: 
The Alabama Senate passed legislation that would ban abortions in almost all cases, including for victims of rape and incest, with the exception of saving the mother's life. The bill's proponents hope that it will set up a legal battle to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion. This bill is part of a wider trend in states to restrict abortion access, with 16 states passing or considering "heartbeat" abortion bans. Alabama's bill is particularly demeaning as it would criminalize abortion providers and punish them with prison time. The bill's sponsors intentionally left out exceptions for rape and incest to strengthen their case for a federal court battle. Anti-choice advocates are applauded for this alarming development, while pro-abortion rights groups express concern that the current Supreme Court makeup puts Roe v. Wade at risk, with the potential for criminalizing and punishing women seeking abortions.
