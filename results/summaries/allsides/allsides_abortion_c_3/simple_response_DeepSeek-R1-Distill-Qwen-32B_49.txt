Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Alabama passing a strict abortion ban. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, okay, first I should read through the article to get the main points.

The Alabama Senate passed a bill that almost completely bans abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. It only allows abortions to save the mother's life. The punishment for performing an abortion is 10-99 years in prison. They removed exceptions for rape and incest to make the law strong enough to challenge Roe v. Wade. Supporters hope this leads to a Supreme Court case overturning Roe. Sixteen states have similar laws, but Alabama's is the most restrictive. Pro-choice groups are upset, saying it's demeaning and targets women and doctors. They also mention the recent Supreme Court changes making Roe v. Wade at risk.

I need to make sure the summary includes the moral aspects, like the removal of exceptions for rape and incest, the intention to challenge Roe v. Wade, and the pro-choice groups' reactions. Also, the impact on women and doctors should be highlighted.

Let me structure this: start with the bill passing, its restrictions, the intent to challenge Roe v. Wade, the removal of exceptions, the penalties, the state's position, and the reactions from pro-choice groups and the political implications.

I should keep it under 200 words. Let me check each point and condense them without losing the moral framing. Make sure to mention the consequences for women and the political strategy behind the bill.

SUMMARY: The Alabama Senate passed a near-total abortion ban, excluding cases of rape, incest, and life-threatening situations, sending it to Gov. Kay Ivey for approval. The bill, which could lead to 10-99 years in prison for providers, aims to challenge the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Proponents removed exceptions for rape and incest to strengthen the law for a potential Supreme Court battle. Alabama's law is the most restrictive in the U.S., with 16 states considering similar measures. Pro-choice advocates condemned the bill, calling it demeaning and targeting women and doctors, while emphasizing the threat to Roe v. Wade under the current Supreme Court composition. END OF SUMMARY.
