SUMMARY:

The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that bans nearly all abortions in the state, with a 25-6 margin. The bill would only permit abortions if necessary to save a mother's life, and would punish anyone performing an abortion with 10 to 99 years in prison. The legislation does not include exceptions for rape and incest, and was intentionally written to be restrictive in order to challenge the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The bill's proponents hope it will lead to a Supreme Court battle and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The bill has been condemned by pro-abortion rights groups, who argue that it is a total ban on abortion and would criminalize women and doctors. The bill now heads to Governor Kay Ivey's desk, where it awaits her signature.
