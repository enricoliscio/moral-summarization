SUMMARY: 
The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that would ban abortions in almost all cases, including for victims of rape and incest, with the only exception being when the mother's life is at risk. The bill, which is now on Governor Ivey's desk, has sparked moral outrage from pro-abortion rights advocates. State Representative Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, hopes it will lead to a Supreme Court battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. With no exceptions for rape and incest, the bill has been criticized as demeaning to women and as a criminalization of abortion. Pro-choice advocates are concerned that the current Supreme Court makeup, following the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, puts Roe v. Wade at risk. They argue that the Alabama bill is part of a wider trend of "alarming" abortion restrictions and an attempt to "outlaw" abortion, "punishing" women and doctors. The bill's passage has been met with strong opposition, with state Senator Vivian Figures questioning who would want to remain in a state with such restrictive laws.
