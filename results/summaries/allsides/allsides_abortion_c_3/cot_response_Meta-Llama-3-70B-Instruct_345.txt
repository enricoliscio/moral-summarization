SUMMARY:
The Alabama Senate has passed a highly restrictive abortion law, banning nearly all abortions in the state, including for victims of rape and incest. The law, which would punish doctors with up to 99 years in prison, is considered the most restrictive in the country. Proponents of the law hope it will lead to a Supreme Court battle and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, have condemned the law as "dangerous" and "demeaning", arguing that it criminalizes women and doctors. The law's passage has sparked outrage, with one state senator warning that it will drive people out of the state. The move is seen as a threat to women's rights, particularly given the current makeup of the Supreme Court. END OF SUMMARY.
