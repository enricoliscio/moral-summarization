SUMMARY:
The Alabama Senate has passed a bill that bans nearly all abortions in the state, with a 25-6 margin. The legislation, which is the most restrictive abortion law in the country, would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother's life. Anyone performing an abortion could be punished by 10 to 99 years in prison. The bill's proponents hope to set up a Supreme Court battle that will see the overturning of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, have condemned the vote, calling the law "dangerous" and "demeaning". The organization's president, Ilyse Hogue, expressed concern that the current makeup of the Supreme Court puts Roe v. Wade at risk. The bill's passage has sparked outrage, with many calling it a "total ban on abortion" that "criminalizes the act and punishes women and doctors". END OF SUMMARY.
