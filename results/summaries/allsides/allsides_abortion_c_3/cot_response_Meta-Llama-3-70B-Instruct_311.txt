SUMMARY:
The Alabama Senate has passed a highly restrictive abortion law, banning the procedure in nearly all instances, including cases of rape and incest. The law, which would punish doctors who perform abortions with up to 99 years in prison, is considered the most restrictive in the country. Proponents of the law hope it will lead to a Supreme Court battle and the eventual overturning of Roe v. Wade. Critics, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, have condemned the law as "dangerous" and "demeaning", arguing that it criminalizes women and doctors. The law's passage has sparked outrage, with some lawmakers warning that it will drive people out of the state. The move is seen as part of a broader effort to restrict abortion rights, with 16 states considering or having passed similar laws. END OF SUMMARY.
