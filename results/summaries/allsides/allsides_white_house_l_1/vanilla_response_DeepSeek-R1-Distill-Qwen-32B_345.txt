Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John F. Kelly's tenure as White House Chief of Staff. The user has provided the article, and they want a concise summary, no more than 200 words. They also specified that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Kelly's role under Trump, his departure, and his alignment with Trump's policies despite being seen as more disciplined. It mentions specific incidents like the spat with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War, defending Rob Porter, and his role in the family separation policy. The conclusion is that Kelly's presence didn't change the administration's ethos, which is tied to Trump's ideology.

I need to condense these points. I should mention Kelly's tenure, his departure, his alignment with Trump's ideology despite being more temperate, specific examples of his actions, and the conclusion about the administration's ethos.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce Kelly's role and departure, then highlight key incidents, and conclude with the overall assessment of his impact. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all essential elements.

Let me draft the summary:

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, who served as White House Chief of Staff under President Donald Trump, announced his departure by year-end. While seen as more disciplined than Trump, Kelly aligned with Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance of bigotry. Examples include his dispute with Rep. Frederica Wilson, his controversial comments on the Civil War, defending aide Rob Porter amid domestic abuse allegations, and his role in the "zero tolerance" immigration policy leading to family separations. Despite efforts to bring normalcy, Kelly's actions reflected Trump's worldview, highlighting that the administration's ethos flows from Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.

I'll check the word count. It's concise, covers all main points, and fits the structure. Looks good.
