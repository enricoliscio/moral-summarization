Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this article about John Kelly's tenure as Trump's chief of staff. Let me read through the article first to get a good grasp of the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Kelly visiting a cemetery in France, but quickly moves on to his role in the Trump administration. It highlights that he's been serving for nearly two years and is stepping down by the end of the year. The key point is that the article isn't just about his performance, but what he represents in the broader Trump era.

The article compares Kelly to Trump, noting that while Kelly lacks Trump's impulsive behavior, he shares the same ideological foundation. Examples given include his clash with Rep. Wilson over false credit claims, his comments on the Civil War, and his defense of the "zero tolerance" immigration policy which led to child separations.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main themes: Kelly's tenure, his alignment with Trump's ideology despite his demeanor, specific incidents that illustrate this, and the conclusion that the administration's ethos comes from Trump himself.

I'll start by stating Kelly's role and tenure, then move into his ideological alignment, using the Wilson incident and Civil War comments as examples. Next, I'll address the immigration policy and child separation, highlighting Kelly's defense of it. Finally, I'll conclude that despite his image as a moderate, the administration's core issues stem from Trump.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically and covers all key points without getting bogged down in details. Keeping it concise and within the word limit is crucial. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each paragraph in the summary addresses a main point from the article.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, President Trump's chief of staff, announced his departure from the White House by the end of 2018. While his tenure was marked by an attempt to bring order, Kelly embodied Trumpism, sharing the president's ideological foundations despite lacking Trump's impulsiveness. This was evident in his clash with Rep. Frederica Wilson over false credit claims, his controversial remarks on the Civil War, and his defense of the administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separations. Kelly's actions, including his support for aide Rob Porter amid domestic abuse allegations, highlighted his alignment with Trump's casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. The article concludes that Kelly's supposed moderation was an illusion, as the administration's ethos ultimately flowed from Trump, making Kelly's tenure a reflection of the president's core values. END OF SUMMARY.
