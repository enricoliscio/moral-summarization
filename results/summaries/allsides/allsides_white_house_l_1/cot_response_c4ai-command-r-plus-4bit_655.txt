SUMMARY:
John Kelly's tenure as President Trump's chief of staff reveals a commitment to the president's ideology, marked by casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and indifference to moral decency. Kelly's spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, defense of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and support for domestic abuser Rob Porter reflect his disregard for critics and minorities. Most consequentially, Kelly defended and shaped the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, resulting in child separation and detention. Despite his temperate demeanor, Kelly shares Trump's worldview, prioritizing ethnonationalist instincts over common decency. Kelly's failure to control Trump highlights that moderation in appearance does not equate to true moderation. The ethos of the administration stems from the president himself, and Kelly's tenure underscores the importance of moral leadership over superficial appearances of moderation. END OF SUMMARY.
