SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has been a representative of "Trumpism" in the White House. Despite his more temperate demeanor, Kelly shares the president's basic worldview, including a tolerance for bigotry and a commitment to casual cruelty. This was evident in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he displayed open disrespect for black female critics of the administration. Kelly also blamed the Civil War on a "lack of ability to compromise" and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Furthermore, he backed senior aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse, calling him a "man of true integrity and honor." Kelly was also an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to child separation, and showed a heartless attitude towards the families affected. His tenure has shown that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the president's rotten ideology. END OF SUMMARY.
