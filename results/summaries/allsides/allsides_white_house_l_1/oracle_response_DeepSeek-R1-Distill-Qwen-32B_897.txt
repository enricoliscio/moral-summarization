Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided and keep the summary under 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about John Kelly's tenure as Trump's Chief of Staff, highlighting his role in Trump's administration and the moral issues he was associated with. The author uses specific words to convey disapproval, so I need to make sure those are included.

I'll start by noting the key events: Kelly's visit to the cemetery, his departure, and his role in the administration. Then, I'll identify the moral aspects, like his behavior towards Rep. Wilson, the Confederate praise, and the immigration policies. Each of these points uses the specified moral words.

I need to ensure that the summary flows logically, covering each incident and the moral implications. I'll also make sure to include the words like "chaotic," "cruelty," "bigotry," "disdain," "abuse," and "dehumanization." 

I'll structure the summary to highlight how Kelly's actions reflect the administration's ethos, emphasizing that his presence didn't change the core issues. The conclusion should tie back to the main point that moderation in appearance isn't enough if the underlying ethos is flawed.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key moral points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, leaves the White House amid chaos and disorder, embodying the "Trumpism" ideology. Despite his temperance, Kelly shared Trump's casual cruelty, bigotry, and tolerance for bad behavior. During a spat with Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, Kelly disrespected her, signaling disdain for black female critics. He also praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, ignoring the Civil War's roots in slavery, and defended Trump's "both sides" rhetoric after the Charlottesville violence. Kelly backed Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, showing indifference to the allegations. He was also a key architect of the "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separations, shrugging off the cruelty of the policy. Kelly's tenure highlights that the appearance of moderation is not moderation; the administration's ethos flows from Trump's core worldview, emphasizing chaos, impulse, and contempt for decency. END OF SUMMARY.
