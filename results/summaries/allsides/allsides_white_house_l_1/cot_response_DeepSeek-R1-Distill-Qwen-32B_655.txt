Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article about John F. Kelly. They also want me to identify morally framed words and then write a summary preserving those frames. 

First, I need to understand the article. It's about Kelly's tenure as Trump's chief of staff, highlighting his role in promoting Trump's policies and the moral issues involved. The user provided a detailed response with STEP 1 listing moral words and a concise summary. 

I think the user is probably a student or researcher analyzing media bias or political ethics. They might be looking to understand how the article portrays Kelly's actions morally. 

In the summary, I should focus on the key points: Kelly's support for Trump's policies, his actions that show cruelty, disrespect, and his failure to moderate Trump. I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the morally charged words from the article.

I should also ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's critical tone towards Kelly, emphasizing his alignment with Trump's ideology despite his image as a stabilizing figure. 

I need to structure the summary to flow logically, starting with his role, then specific incidents, and ending with the conclusion about the administration's ethos. 

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to include the key moral terms and keep it concise.

**SUMMARY:**  
John F. Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, left the White House as chaotic as it was when he arrived. While he lacked Trump's intemperate attitude, Kelly embodied Trumpism through his casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and undisciplined behavior. Examples include his disrespectful treatment of Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, his controversial praise of Robert E. Lee after Charlottesville, and his indifferent defense of Rob Porter amid domestic abuse allegations. Kelly also played a key role in implementing Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separations, calling it a "cruel and heartless" but necessary action. Despite his image as an "adult in the room," Kelly shared Trump's worldview, prioritizing normalcy over decency. His tenure highlights that moderation is overrated and that the administration's ethos flows from Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.
