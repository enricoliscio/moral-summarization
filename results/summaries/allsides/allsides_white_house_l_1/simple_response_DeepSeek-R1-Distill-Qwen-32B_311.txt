Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John F. Kelly's tenure as Chief of Staff under Trump, focusing on the moral framing the author presented. The user wants the summary to capture the moral aspects, so I should highlight Kelly's role in Trumpism, his actions, and the implications.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The article talks about Kelly's departure, his role in Trump's administration, his traits like casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry, the spat with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War, the Porter scandal, and the zero-tolerance immigration policy leading to child separations.

I need to condense these into a summary under 200 words. I should mention that Kelly represented Trumpism, even if he lacked Trump's impulsiveness. Highlight his actions showing cruelty and bigotry, like the Wilson incident, the Civil War comments post-Charlottesville, supporting Porter despite abuse allegations, and the immigration policy where he defended child separations.

I should also note the author's point that Kelly's supposed moderation didn't change the administration's ethos, which flows from Trump. So the summary should convey that Kelly's tenure didn't improve the administration morally but rather showed its core issues.

I need to structure it clearly, starting with his role, then his actions, and the conclusion about the administration's ethos. Make sure to include the key moral failings and the implications of his tenure.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all these elements within the word limit.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, who served as President Donald Trump's chief of staff, embodies the core principles of "Trumpism," despite lacking Trump's impulsiveness. Kelly's tenure highlighted his commitment to Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. This was evident in his confrontation with Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he falsely accused her of taking credit for an FBI field office, and his defense of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in the wake of the Charlottesville white nationalist rally. Kelly also defended Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, despite knowing about a protective order against him. Perhaps most notably, Kelly was a key architect of the administration's "zero-tolerance" immigration policy, which led to the separation of children from their parents at the border. When questioned about the policy's cruelty, Kelly dismissed it as a necessary measure, aligning himself with Trump's dehumanizing approach. While Kelly presented as a moderating influence, his actions revealed that the administration's ethos—rooted in cruelty and contempt for decency—remained unchanged. His tenure underscores that the appearance of moderation is not the same as moderation, and the administration's moral failings flow directly from Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
