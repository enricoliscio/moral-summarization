SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, White House chief of staff, has announced his departure by the end of the year. Despite being seen as a voice of reason, Kelly shares President Trump's ideology, including tolerance for bigotry and cruelty. He demonstrated this in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he accused her of taking false credit for an FBI field office, and in an interview where he blamed the Civil War on a "lack of compromise" and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Kelly also backed senior aide Rob Porter despite allegations of domestic abuse and was a key architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, which led to child separation. His tenure shows that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the president. Kelly's departure may be a blessing in disguise, as a more disciplined Trump administration could be more effective in implementing its harmful policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
