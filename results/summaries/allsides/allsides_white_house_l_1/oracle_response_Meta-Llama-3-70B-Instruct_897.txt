SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has served for nearly two years, leaving the White House as chaotic and disordered as when he took the job. Kelly's commitment to Trump's ideology, including his casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry and bad behavior, is more concerning than his performance. He demonstrated disdain for black female critics, blamed the Civil War on a "lack of ability to compromise," and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly also backed senior aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse, calling him a "man of true integrity and honor." Moreover, Kelly was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to child separation, and showed indifference to the charges. His tenure reveals that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the president's rotten ideology, marked by casual cruelty, bigotry, and contempt for common decency. 

END OF SUMMARY.
