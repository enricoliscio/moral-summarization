SUMMARY: In the wake of his resignation, John Kelly's tenure as President Trump's chief of staff is assessed for its impact on the administration's ethos. Despite valuing normalcy and order, Kelly shared Trump's worldview, including a tolerance for bigotry and cruelty. Kelly's indifference to allegations of domestic abuse by a senior aide and his defense of the administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which separated children from their parents, exemplified this. Kelly's performance demonstrates that the appearance of moderation should not be confused with actual moderation. The ethos of the Trump administration flows from the president himself, and a more disciplined Trump might have been even more effective in enacting his ethnonationalist agenda. Kelly's failure to control the president may have inadvertently prevented a more insidious manifestation of Trumpism.

END OF SUMMARY.
