SUMMARY:
The article discusses the tenure of John Kelly, former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, and his role in shaping the Trump administration's ethos. Despite Kelly's reputation for moderation and temperance, he shared the president's enthusiasm for cruelty and contempt for common decency. This was evident in his defense of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, which resulted in child separation and detention camps. Kelly also displayed a pattern of disrespect towards black female critics of the administration and indifference to allegations of domestic abuse by a senior aide, Rob Porter. In addition, Kelly made controversial remarks about the Civil War, praising Confederate General Robert E. Lee and blaming the conflict on a "lack of ability to compromise." The author argues that Kelly's failure to control the president may have been a blessing in disguise, as a more disciplined Trump could have been even more effective in implementing his ethnonationalist instincts. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation should not be confused with actual moderation and that the ethos of an administration is shaped by the person at the top.
