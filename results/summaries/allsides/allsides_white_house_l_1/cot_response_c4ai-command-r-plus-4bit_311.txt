SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, President Donald Trump's chief of staff, has announced his resignation by the end of the year. Kelly's tenure has been marked by his commitment to Trump's ideology, including its casual *cruelty*, *bigotry*, and tolerance for bad behavior. Notably, Kelly was involved in a spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, showing *disrespect* for a black female critic of the administration. He also made controversial remarks about the Civil War, blaming it on a "lack of ability to compromise" and praising Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. In the case of domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter, Kelly showed *indifference* to the charges and defended the accused. However, Kelly's most consequential moment was his defense and involvement in the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, resulting in child separation and placing children in detention camps. Despite being seen as the "adult in the room," Kelly's failure to control Trump's worst impulses reveals a shared *contempt* for *decency* and a commitment to ethnonationalist instincts. Kelly's tenure teaches us that moderation is not just about appearance but ethos, flowing from the leader.
