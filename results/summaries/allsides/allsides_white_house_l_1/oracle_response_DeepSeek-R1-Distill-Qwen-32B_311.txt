Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John F. Kelly's tenure as Chief of Staff under Trump, preserving the moral framing used by the author. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that I should include as much as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should highlight Kelly's role in the Trump administration's problematic policies and behaviors.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The article talks about Kelly's tenure, his role in the administration, and how he embodies Trumpism despite his more tempered demeanor. It mentions several incidents: the spat with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War and Robert E. Lee, defending Rob Porter despite abuse allegations, and his role in the family separation policy. Each of these incidents reflects Kelly's alignment with Trump's ideology, emphasizing cruelty, bigotry, and a lack of respect for decency.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list that are present in the article. Words like chaotic, disordered, cruelty, bigotry, refusal, signaling, disdain, disrespect, blamed, praised, conflict, expansion, slavery, violence, tragedy, defend, chaos, impulse, shares, abuse, defiant, backed, indifferent, scandal, separation, placing, shrug, care, dehumanization, impulses, display, contempt, worse, effective, translate.

I'll structure the summary to cover each main point, using these words where appropriate. I'll start by stating that Kelly's tenure ended with the White House as chaotic and disordered as when he began. Then, I'll mention his role as an embodiment of Trumpism, focusing on his commitment to Trump's ideology despite lacking Trump's intemperate behavior.

Next, I'll touch on the specific incidents: the spat with Wilson, his Civil War comments, defending Porter, and the family separation policy. Each of these should highlight the moral issues, using terms like cruelty, bigotry, disregard, etc.

I'll conclude by emphasizing that Kelly's supposed moderation didn't change the administration's ethos, which flows from Trump. The key takeaway is that the appearance of moderation doesn't equate to actual moderation.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, each sentence connecting the points without being too verbose. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, making sure to include as many of the specified moral terms as possible without forcing them.

Let me draft the summary:

John F. Kelly's tenure as Chief of Staff ended with the White House as chaotic and disordered as when he began. His role embodied Trumpism, focusing on Trump's ideology despite lacking his intemperate behavior. Kelly's actions, like the spat with Rep. Wilson, his Civil War comments praising Robert E. Lee, and defending Rob Porter despite abuse allegations, showed a tolerance for cruelty and bigotry. His role in the family separation policy, where he dismissed the impact on children, highlighted his casual cruelty and dehumanization. Despite his supposed normalcy, Kelly shared Trump's worldview, emphasizing that the administration's ethos comes from Trump. The summary should reflect that moderation in appearance doesn't mean moderation in substance.

Now, I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll also make sure all the key moral terms are included where appropriate without making the summary feel forced or unnatural.
