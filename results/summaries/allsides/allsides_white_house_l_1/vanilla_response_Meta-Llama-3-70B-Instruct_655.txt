SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, White House Chief of Staff, has announced his departure by the end of the year. Despite his attempts to bring normalcy to the Trump administration, Kelly shares the president's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Examples of this include his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he accused her of taking false credit for an FBI field office, and his comments on the Civil War, where he blamed the lack of compromise and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Kelly also defended senior aide Rob Porter against domestic abuse allegations and was a key architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, which led to child separation. His tenure shows that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the president. Kelly's departure will not change the administration's ideology.

END OF SUMMARY.
