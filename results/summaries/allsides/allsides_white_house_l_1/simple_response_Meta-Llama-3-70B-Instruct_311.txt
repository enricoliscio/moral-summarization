SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodies the ideology of "Trumpism" with his commitment to casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disdain for critics, particularly black women. Kelly's tenure has been marked by incidents showcasing his problematic worldview, including his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he accused her of taking false credit for an FBI field office, and his praise for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." He also backed senior aide Rob Porter despite allegations of domestic abuse and was a key architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, which led to child separation. Kelly's actions demonstrate that even a more disciplined and temperate individual cannot change the administration's ethos, which is rooted in cruelty and contempt for common decency. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the administration's underlying ethos.

END OF SUMMARY.
