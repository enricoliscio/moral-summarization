SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly has announced that he will be stepping down as Chief of Staff to President Donald Trump by the end of the year. Despite being known as the "adult in the room," tasked with taming Trump's impulsive behavior, Kelly shares the president's basic worldview and has been complicit in many of the administration's most controversial moments. Kelly has displayed a pattern of disrespect towards black female critics of the administration and has made controversial statements praising Confederate figures and blaming the Civil War on a lack of compromise. He also backed Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, and defended the administration's "zero-tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents at the border. Kelly's tenure highlights that the appearance of moderation does not equate to actual moderation, and that the ethos of the Trump administration is driven by the president himself.
END OF SUMMARY.
