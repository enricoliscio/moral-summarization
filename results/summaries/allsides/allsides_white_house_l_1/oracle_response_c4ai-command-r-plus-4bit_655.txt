SUMMARY: John Kelly, former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodies the ideology of "Trumpism" and shares the president's basic worldview, marked by chaos, impulse, cruelty, and contempt for common decency. Kelly's tenure was marked by his disdain for black female critics, tolerance for bigotry, and indifference to allegations of domestic abuse against a senior aide. He defended and helped craft the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, resulting in child separation and detention camps. Despite his reputation as the "adult in the room," Kelly's moderation was superficial, and his failure to control the president may have prevented a more effective and disciplined Trump from enacting ethnonationalist policies. Kelly's tenure teaches that moderation is superficial and that the ethos of an administration is shaped by its leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
