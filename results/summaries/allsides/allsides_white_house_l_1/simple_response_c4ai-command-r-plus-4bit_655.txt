SUMMARY: John Kelly, former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodies the ideological core of Trumpism, marked by a casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Kelly's disregard for black female critics, insensitive remarks on the Civil War, and indifference to domestic abuse allegations against a senior aide reflect his alignment with Trump's worldview. Despite his preference for order, Kelly's tenure demonstrates that moderation is superficial when the underlying ethos promotes cruelty and bigotry. Kelly's failure to control Trump's impulses may have inadvertently prevented a more disciplined and effective ethnonationalist presidency. The lesson from Kelly's experience is that appearances of moderation are deceptive, and the ethos of an administration is shaped by the values of its leader. 

END OF SUMMARY.
