SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who served as chief of staff to President Donald Trump, will leave the White House by the end of the year. Despite his commitment to basic elements of Trump's ideology, Kelly's tenure has been marked by casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disrespect for black female critics. He blamed the Civil War on "the lack of the ability to compromise" and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly also backed a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, calling him a "man of true integrity and honor." Moreover, he was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to the separation of immigrant children from their parents. Kelly's indifference to the charges and his shrugging off the cruelty of the policy encapsulate the rotten ideology of the Trump administration. END OF SUMMARY.
