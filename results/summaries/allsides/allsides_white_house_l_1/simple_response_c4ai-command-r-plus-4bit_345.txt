SUMMARY: For almost two years, John Kelly served as Donald Trump's chief of staff, yet he failed to bring order to the chaotic White House. Kelly embodied "Trumpism," marked by casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and indifference to allegations of abuse. Kelly's disdain for black female critics was evident in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, and he defended Confederate General Robert E. Lee, blaming the Civil War on a lack of compromise. He supported aide Rob Porter despite abuse allegations and was an architect of the child separation policy at the border, shrugging off concerns about its cruelty. Despite valuing normalcy and temperance, Kelly shared Trump's worldview. His failure to control the president may have inadvertently prevented a more disciplined and effective Trump, translating ethnonationalist instincts into policy. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that appearances of moderation are deceptive, and the ethos of an administration is shaped by its leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
