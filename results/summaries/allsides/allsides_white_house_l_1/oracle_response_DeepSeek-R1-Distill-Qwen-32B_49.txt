Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about John F. Kelly's tenure as Trump's chief of staff, highlighting his role in Trumpism. They also listed specific morally charged words that I need to include.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about Kelly's time in the White House, his behavior, and how he embodies Trump's ideology despite being seen as more tempered. Key events include his spat with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War, his support for Rob Porter, and his role in the child separation policy.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the listed moral words as possible. Words like "chaotic," "cruelty," "bigotry," "disdain," "abuse," "dehumanization," etc., should be incorporated.

I'll start by outlining the main events and then weave in the moral terms. I'll make sure the summary stays under 200 words and captures the essence of Kelly's actions and their moral implications.

I should also ensure that the summary reflects the author's framing, which is critical of Kelly's actions and their alignment with Trump's policies. Highlighting the negative impacts and the moral failings is crucial.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to cover each key event, using the moral terms to emphasize the negative aspects of Kelly's behavior and policies. This should effectively convey the author's perspective while staying concise.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, Donald Trump's chief of staff, is departing the White House amid chaos and disorder, embodying the "Trumpism" ideology. Despite his reputation for normalcy and temperance, Kelly shared Trump's casual cruelty, tolerance of bigotry, and disregard for decency. This was evident in his spat with Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he disrespected her and displayed disdain for her criticism of Trump's insensitivity. Kelly also praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and blamed the Civil War on a lack of compromise, ignoring its roots in slavery expansion. His refusal to apologize for these actions highlighted his open disrespect for black female critics. Kelly defended Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, calling him a man of integrity despite knowing about a protective order against him. His indifference to the allegations made it a significant scandal. Most notably, Kelly played a key role in the administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separation. When asked if it was cruel to take children from their mothers, Kelly shrugged, saying they would be cared for in foster homes. This encapsulated Trump's ideology of dehumanization and casual cruelty. Kelly's tenure revealed that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and the administration's ethos flows from Trump's ethnonationalist worldview. END OF SUMMARY.
