SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has been a representative of "Trumpism" in the White House. Despite his commitment to normalcy and temperance, Kelly shares the president's ideology, including casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disrespect for black female critics. He demonstrated these traits in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, his praise for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and his defense of senior aide Rob Porter amidst domestic abuse allegations. Kelly was also an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to child separation at the border. His indifference to the suffering of others embodies the rotten ideology of the Trump administration. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the top. Kelly's failure to control Trump may be a blessing in disguise, as a more disciplined Trump would be a more effective one in implementing his harmful policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
