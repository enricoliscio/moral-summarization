Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about John Kelly's tenure as Chief of Staff under Trump. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article starts by mentioning Kelly's visit to a cemetery in France. Then it talks about his two years as Chief of Staff and his departure. The key point is that while Kelly lacks Trump's impulsiveness, he shares Trump's ideology. The author uses examples like his interaction with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War, his support for Rob Porter despite domestic abuse allegations, and his role in the child separation policy.

I need to highlight these examples to show how Kelly embodies Trumpism. The summary should show that Kelly's actions reflect the administration's values of cruelty, bigotry, and disregard for decency. Also, the article concludes that Kelly's supposed moderation didn't change the administration's ethos, which is tied to Trump.

I should structure the summary to include Kelly's key actions and their implications, emphasizing the moral issues. Keeping it under 200 words and using clear, concise language is important. I'll make sure to mention each example briefly but clearly, linking them back to the overall critique of Trumpism.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, Trump's Chief of Staff, embodies "Trumpism" despite lacking Trump's impulsiveness. Kelly's tenure saw him defend the administration's controversial policies, including the "zero tolerance" immigration policy that separated children from their parents, which he dismissed as "cruel and heartless" but deemed acceptable. He also clashed with Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, falsely accusing her of taking credit for an FBI building, and defended Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, despite knowing about a restraining order. Kelly's actions reflect Trump's worldview of casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry, despite his reputation as a "moderate" voice. His tenure highlights that the administration's ethos flows from Trump, not Kelly, and that the appearance of moderation does not equate to actual moderation. END OF SUMMARY.
