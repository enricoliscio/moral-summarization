SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodies the Trump era's ideology, including casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and bad behavior. Despite his commitment to normalcy and temperance, Kelly shares Trump's worldview, as seen in his handling of controversies, such as his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he displayed open disrespect for black female critics. He also blamed the Civil War on a "lack of ability to compromise" and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Kelly's indifference to domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter and his role in architecting the child separation policy demonstrate his alignment with Trump's rotten ideology. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the top. Kelly's failure to control Trump may be a blessing in disguise, as a more disciplined Trump would be a more effective one.

END OF SUMMARY.
