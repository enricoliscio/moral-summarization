Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without making it too longâ€”no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. John Kelly served as Trump's chief of staff, and the article talks about his tenure being chaotic and disordered. It mentions his commitment to Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. There are specific incidents like the spat with Rep. Wilson, where he disrespected her, and his praise for Robert E. Lee, which ties into the Civil War context. 

Then, there's the part about Kelly defending Rob Porter despite the abuse allegations, showing his indifference. The most significant point is his role in the child separation policy, which the author describes as dehumanizing. The article concludes that Kelly's presence didn't change the administration's ethos, which is tied to Trump's worldview.

I need to structure the summary to include these key events and the moral terms. I'll start by stating Kelly's tenure and the chaos, then mention his ideological alignment with Trump. I'll include the Wilson incident, the Civil War remarks, the Porter scandal, and the child separation policy. I'll end with the conclusion about the administration's ethos.

I have to make sure to use as many of the provided moral words as possible without forcing them. I'll check each sentence to see if I can incorporate words like "chaotic," "disorder," "cruelty," "bigotry," "disdain," "disrespect," "scandal," "separation," "dehumanization," etc.

I'll also keep the summary concise, ensuring it flows well and covers all the main moral points without exceeding 200 words. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each event is briefly mentioned with the appropriate moral framing.

SUMMARY: John F. Kelly's tenure as President Trump's chief of staff was marked by chaos and disorder, reflecting the administration's broader ethos. Despite his reputation as a "moderate," Kelly embodied Trumpism, sharing its casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disdain for critics. His confrontation with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he disrespected her over false accusations, highlighted his disrespect for black female critics. Kelly also praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, downplaying the Civil War's roots in slavery, just months after the Charlottesville violence. He defended Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, showing indifference to the allegations. Most notably, Kelly played a key role in the "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separation, shrugging off the cruelty of separating families. His actions revealed a commitment to Trump's worldview, emphasizing that normalcy and temperance could not mask the administration's contempt for decency. Kelly's tenure underscores that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and the administration's ethos flows from Trump's ethnonationalist impulses. END OF SUMMARY.
