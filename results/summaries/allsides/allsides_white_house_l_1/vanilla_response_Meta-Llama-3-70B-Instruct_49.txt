SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, Chief of Staff to President Donald Trump, has announced his departure from the White House by the end of the year. Despite being seen as a voice of reason, Kelly shares Trump's ideology, including a tolerance for bigotry and cruelty. He demonstrated this during a spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he accused her of taking false credit for an FBI field office, and in an interview where he blamed the Civil War on a "lack of ability to compromise" and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Kelly also backed a senior aide accused of domestic abuse and was a key architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, which led to child separation. His tenure shows that even a more disciplined Trump administration would likely still display enthusiasm for cruelty and contempt for common decency. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the president.

END OF SUMMARY.
