Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this article while keeping the moral framing intact. The user provided the article and a list of morally charged words. My goal is to create a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. John Kelly was Trump's chief of staff, and the article discusses his tenure, highlighting his behavior and the moral issues surrounding his actions. The key events mentioned are his spat with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War, his support for Rob Porter, and his role in the child separation policy.

I need to make sure I include the morally framed words from the list. Words like "chaotic," "disordered," "cruelty," "bigotry," "disdain," "disrespect," "abuse," "indifferent," "scandal," "separation," "dehumanization," etc., should be included where appropriate.

I'll start by outlining the main events and then incorporate the moral language. For example, when discussing Kelly's spat with Wilson, I can use "disdain" and "disrespect." His comments on the Civil War can tie into "expansion of slavery." The Porter scandal involves "abuse" and "indifferent." The child separation policy highlights "cruelty" and "dehumanization."

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with his role, then moving through each event, and ending with the conclusion about the administration's ethos. I need to ensure that each point is concise and that the moral framing is preserved without making the summary too long.

I also need to make sure that the summary doesn't exceed 200 words. I'll draft each section, count the words, and adjust as necessary. It's important to capture the essence of each event and the moral implications without going into too much detail.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and that the morally framed words are appropriately included. This should result in a clear, concise summary that reflects the original article's moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, left the White House as chaotic and disordered as it was when he arrived. Kelly embodied Trumpism, sharing the president's casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and contempt for decency. During a spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, Kelly displayed disdain and disrespect, falsely accusing her of taking credit for an FBI building. His refusal to apologize highlighted his disregard for black female critics. Kelly also praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, blaming the Civil War on a lack of compromise, despite its roots in slavery's expansion. This came after the Charlottesville tragedy, where Trump defended white nationalists. Kelly defended Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, calling him a man of integrity despite knowing about a protective order. Kelly's indifference to the charges made it a scandal. He was also a key architect of the "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separation. When asked if it was cruel, Kelly shrugged, showing the administration's dehumanization of immigrants. Despite Kelly's supposed normalcy, he shared Trump's worldview, proving that the administration's ethos flows from the top. END OF SUMMARY.
