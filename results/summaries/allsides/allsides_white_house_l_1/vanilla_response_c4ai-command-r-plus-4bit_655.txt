SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who served as President Donald Trump's chief of staff for nearly two years, has announced his resignation by the end of 2018. Despite his departure, the White House remains chaotic and disordered. Kelly's performance is overshadowed by his alignment with Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Incidents such as his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, his comments on the Civil War, and his defense of Rob Porter against domestic abuse allegations showcase Kelly's indifference to ethical concerns. Most notably, Kelly was an architect of the "zero tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents at the border, displaying a callous attitude towards human suffering. While Kelly values normalcy and discipline, he shares Trump's problematic worldview. His failure to control the president may have inadvertently prevented a more disciplined and effective Trump, whose ethnonationalist instincts could have been translated into concrete policy. Kelly's tenure teaches that appearances of moderation are misleading, and the ethos of an administration is shaped by its leader. 

END OF SUMMARY.
