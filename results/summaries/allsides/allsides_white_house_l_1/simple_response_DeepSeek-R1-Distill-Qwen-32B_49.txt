Okay, I need to summarize this news article about John F. Kelly's tenure as Chief of Staff under Trump, focusing on the moral framing. The user wants the summary to preserve the author's moral perspective. Let me read through the article to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning Kelly's visit to a cemetery, then moves into his role under Trump. It highlights that while Kelly lacks Trump's impulsiveness, he shares Trump's core beliefs, like casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. 

There are specific examples: the spat with Rep. Wilson, where Kelly accused her falsely. Then, his comments on the Civil War, praising Robert E. Lee, which came after the Charlottesville rally. Also, his defense of Rob Porter despite domestic abuse allegations. Lastly, Kelly's role in the "zero tolerance" immigration policy, separating children from parents, which the article deems cruel and heartless.

The author's moral stance is clear: Kelly, despite seeming more tempered, embodies Trump's ideology. The summary should reflect that Kelly's actions and statements support the administration's problematic policies and attitudes, showing that the administration's ethos is rooted in Trump's values.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary, highlighting Kelly's role as a representative of Trumpism, his specific actions that reflect this, and the conclusion that the administration's issues stem from Trump's leadership. I'll make sure to mention the key examples and the moral judgment that Kelly didn't improve the administration but upheld its problematic ethos.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, Trump's Chief of Staff, embodies "Trumpism" despite lacking Trump's impulsiveness. Kelly's tenure revealed his alignment with Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Examples include his false accusation against Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, his problematic comments on the Civil War and Robert E. Lee after the Charlottesville rally, and his defense of Rob Porter despite domestic abuse allegations. Kelly also played a key role in the "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which separated children from parents, shrugging off the cruelty as "taken care of." The article criticizes Kelly for failing to temper Trump's worst impulses, arguing that his supposed moderation was an illusion. The administration's ethos, rooted in Trump's leadership, remains unchanged. Kelly's tenure highlights that the appearance of moderation is not the same as moderation, and the administration's problems stem from its core values. END OF SUMMARY.
