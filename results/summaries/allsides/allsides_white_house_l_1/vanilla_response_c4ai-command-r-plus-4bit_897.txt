SUMMARY: For nearly two years, John Kelly served as White House Chief of Staff to President Donald Trump. Despite being known as the "adult in the room," Kelly's tenure was marked by a commitment to Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Kelly displayed open disrespect towards black female critics of the administration and made controversial remarks about the Civil War, blaming it on a "lack of ability to compromise" and praising Confederate figures. He also backed senior aide Rob Porter amid domestic abuse allegations and was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, defending the practice of separating children from their parents. Kelly's failure to control Trump's impulses highlights that the appearance of moderation is not true moderation. The ethos of the administration is shaped by the man at the top, and even a more disciplined Trump guided by Kelly would likely have resulted in a more effective enactment of ethnonationalist instincts.
END OF SUMMARY.
