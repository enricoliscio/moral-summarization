SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly has announced he will step down as White House Chief of Staff by the end of the year, leaving behind a tenure marked by chaos and disorder. While Kelly may have valued normalcy and temperance, he shared President Trump's basic worldview, including a commitment to casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Kelly's disdain for black female critics of the administration was evident in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, and his defense of Confederate General Robert E. Lee showed a disregard for historical context and the recent tragedy in Charlottesville. Kelly also backed a senior aide facing domestic abuse allegations and played a key role in the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, separating children from their parents. Kelly's failure to control the president may have inadvertently prevented a more disciplined and effective Trump, translating his ethnonationalist instincts into policy. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not true moderation, and the ethos of the administration is shaped by the person at the top.
END OF SUMMARY.
