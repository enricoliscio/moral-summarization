SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, President Donald Trump's chief of staff, announced his departure from the White House by the end of the year. Despite his reputation for being a stabilizing force, Kelly's tenure has been marked by his commitment to Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. He demonstrated this in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he accused her of taking false credit for an FBI field office, and in his praise of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly also backed a senior aide accused of domestic abuse and was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, which led to child separation. His performance shows that even if he could have controlled Trump's impulses, the administration would still have displayed enthusiasm for cruelty and contempt for decency. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the top.

END OF SUMMARY.
