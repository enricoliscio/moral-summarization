SUMMARY: John Kelly, President Trump's chief of staff, has announced his departure from the White House, leaving behind a tenure marked by chaos and disorder. Kelly's performance is less notable than his embodiment of Trumpism, marked by casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Kelly's disdain for black female critics, such as Rep. Frederica Wilson, and his defense of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee showcase his indifference to racial issues. His support for aide Rob Porter amid domestic abuse allegations and his role in the child separation policy at the border further highlight his callousness. Despite valuing order over chaos, Kelly shares Trump's harmful worldview. His failure to control the president may have inadvertently prevented a more disciplined and effective Trump, translating ethnonationalist instincts into policy. Kelly's tenure teaches that moderation is more than appearance, and the ethos of an administration reflects the character of its leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
