Okay, I need to summarize this article about John Kelly's tenure as Trump's chief of staff. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning Kelly's visit to a cemetery in France. That's probably just a background detail. The main point is that Kelly is leaving his position, and the White House is as chaotic as before. It then talks about how Kelly represents Trumpism, even though he's more disciplined than Trump.

I should note the key points: Kelly's role in Trump's administration, his handling of specific incidents like the spat with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War and Robert E. Lee, his support for Rob Porter despite domestic abuse allegations, and his role in the family separation policy.

The article also critiques the idea that Kelly was a moderating influence, arguing that he shared Trump's worldview, making the administration's policies even worse if he had more control.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, highlighting Kelly's role, key incidents, and the critique of his supposed moderating influence.

Let me structure it: Start with Kelly's departure and the chaos, mention his representation of Trumpism, then outline the specific incidents showing his alignment with Trump's ideology, and conclude with the critique of his supposed role as a stabilizing force.

I should ensure it's concise, capturing each main point without getting bogged down in details. Also, make sure to end with the summary token as instructed.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, President Trump's chief of staff, is stepping down as the White House remains chaotic. Kelly, seen as a representative of "Trumpism," lacked Trump's impulsiveness but shared his ideological stance, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Examples include his confrontation with Rep. Frederica Wilson over false credit claims, his controversial Civil War comments, and his support for aide Rob Porter despite domestic abuse allegations. Kelly also defended the administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to family separations. While Kelly was seen as a moderating influence, the article argues that his worldview aligned with Trump's, suggesting that even a more disciplined Trump administration would have been worse. Kelly's tenure highlights that the appearance of moderation doesn't equate to true moderation, and the administration's ethos flows from Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.
