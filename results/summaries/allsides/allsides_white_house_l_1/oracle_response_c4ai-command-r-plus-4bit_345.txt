SUMMARY: John Kelly's tenure as White House Chief of Staff under President Donald Trump has come to an end, and his legacy is marred by his indifference to the administration's cruelty and bigotry. Kelly, who was expected to bring order to the chaotic and disordered White House, instead mirrored Trump's worldview, tolerating and even defending the president's impulsive behavior. He showed disdain and disrespect towards critics, including black female Representative Frederica Wilson, and defended the administration's "zero tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents, placing them in detention camps. He also blamed the Civil War on a "lack of compromise," praising Confederate figures and downplaying the conflict's roots in slavery expansion. Kelly's indifference to domestic abuse allegations against a senior aide and his defense of their integrity reflect a pattern of indifference to cruelty and contempt for common decency. His failure to control Trump's impulses may have inadvertently prevented a more disciplined and effective ethnonationalist administration. Kelly's tenure teaches that moderation in appearance is not true moderation, and that the ethos of an administration stems from its leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
