SUMMARY: In the wake of his resignation, former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly's tenure is being scrutinized. Kelly was known for his commitment to basic elements of President Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry and bad behavior. He displayed open disrespect for black female critics of the administration and made controversial remarks about the Civil War, praising Confederate figures. Kelly also backed a senior aide facing domestic abuse allegations and defended the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, demonstrating his indifference to cruelty and bigotry. Despite valuing normalcy and temperance, Kelly shared Trump's worldview, and a more disciplined Trump might have been more effective in enacting ethnonationalist policies. Kelly's failure to control the president benefited the country, as a disciplined Trump could have been more dangerous. The key takeaway from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not true moderation, and the ethos of an administration flows from its leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
