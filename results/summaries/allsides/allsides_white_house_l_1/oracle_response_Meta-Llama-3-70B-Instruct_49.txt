SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has been a representative of "Trumpism" in the White House. Despite his commitment to basic elements of the president's ideology, Kelly's tenure has been marked by chaotic and disordered behavior, casual cruelty, and tolerance for bigotry and bad behavior. He has shown disdain for black female critics, blamed the Civil War on "the lack of ability to compromise," and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly has also been indifferent to allegations of domestic abuse against Rob Porter, calling him a "man of true integrity and honor." Furthermore, he was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy toward immigrants, which led to child separation and dehumanization. Kelly's morally reprehensible actions and words have shown that he shares the president's rotten ideology, which is characterized by contempt for common decency. His failure to control the president has been a blessing in disguise, as a more disciplined Trump would have been more effective in translating his ethnonationalist instincts into policy.

END OF SUMMARY.
