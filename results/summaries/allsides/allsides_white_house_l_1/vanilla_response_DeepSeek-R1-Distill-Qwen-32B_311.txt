Okay, I need to summarize this article about John F. Kelly's tenure as Chief of Staff under Trump. The user provided the full text, so I'll start by reading through it to understand the main points.

The article discusses Kelly's role and how he embodies Trumpism. It mentions his interactions with Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, his comments on the Civil War, his support for Rob Porter despite abuse allegations, and his involvement in the "zero tolerance" immigration policy leading to child separations. It also critiques the idea that Kelly was a moderating influence, arguing he shared Trump's worldview.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key events and the overall argument that Kelly represented Trump's values despite seeming more temperate.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Kelly's actions, his alignment with Trump's policies, and the critique of his supposed moderating role. I'll make sure to mention the main incidents and conclude with the article's stance on his tenure.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping it concise and within the word limit. I'll ensure it flows logically, covering each main point without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, who served as President Donald Trump's chief of staff for nearly two years, is stepping down by the end of 2018. The article argues that Kelly, while lacking Trump's impulsiveness, embodies "Trumpism" through his support for the president's ideology, including casual cruelty and tolerance of bigotry. Key examples include his clash with Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson over false accusations, his controversial comments on the Civil War and Robert E. Lee, and his defense of Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse. Kelly also played a central role in implementing Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separations at the border. The article criticizes Kelly for failing to moderate Trump's worst impulses, as he shares the president's worldview. It concludes that the appearance of moderation is not enough, and the administration's ethos ultimately flows from Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.
