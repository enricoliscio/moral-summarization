SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, President Donald Trump's chief of staff, has announced his departure from the White House by the end of the year. While Kelly may have brought a sense of normalcy and temperance to the administration, he shares Trump's ideology, including a tolerance for bigotry and casual cruelty. Examples of Kelly's behavior include his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he accused her of taking false credit for an FBI field office, and his praise for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly also backed senior aide Rob Porter despite allegations of domestic abuse and was a key architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, which led to child separation. The article argues that Kelly's departure will not change the administration's ethos, which flows from Trump's ideology, and that the appearance of moderation is not moderation.
