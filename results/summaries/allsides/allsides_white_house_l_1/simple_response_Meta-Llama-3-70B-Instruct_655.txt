SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodies the president's ideology, including casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disdain for critics. Kelly's tenure was marked by controversies, including a spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he falsely accused her of taking credit for an FBI field office construction. He also blamed the Civil War on a "lack of ability to compromise" and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Furthermore, Kelly backed senior aide Rob Porter despite allegations of domestic abuse and was a key architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to child separation at the border. Kelly's commitment to Trump's ideology is evident in his words and actions, which demonstrate a disregard for human decency and a willingness to justify cruelty. His tenure serves as a reminder that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and that the ethos of the administration flows from the top.

END OF SUMMARY.
