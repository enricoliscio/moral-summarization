SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has been a representative of "Trumpism" in the White House. Despite lacking Trump's intemperate attitude, Kelly shares the president's ideology, including casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and bad behavior. He demonstrated disdain for black female critics, blamed the Civil War on "the lack of ability to compromise," and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly also backed senior aide Rob Porter, accused of domestic abuse, calling him a "man of true integrity and honor." Furthermore, Kelly was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to child separation, and showed indifference to the charges. The author argues that Kelly's tenure reveals that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the ethos of the administration, which flows from the president's ideology of cruelty, bigotry, and contempt for common decency.
