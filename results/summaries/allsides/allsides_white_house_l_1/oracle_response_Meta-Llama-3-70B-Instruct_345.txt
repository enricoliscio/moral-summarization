SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has served in the White House for nearly two years, leaving behind a legacy of chaos and disordered behavior. Despite his commitment to basic elements of Trump's ideology, Kelly's tenure has been marked by casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and open disrespect for black female critics of the administration. His refusal to apologize for falsely accusing Rep. Frederica Wilson of taking credit for an FBI field office construction exemplifies his disdain for critics. Kelly's praise for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man" and his blame of the Civil War on "the lack of ability to compromise" demonstrate his flawed worldview. Moreover, his defense of senior aide Rob Porter, accused of domestic abuse, and his indifference to the charges, showcase his tolerance for abuse. Kelly's role in architecting the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, resulting in child separation, highlights his dehumanizing approach. Ultimately, Kelly's tenure serves as a reminder that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and that the ethos of the administration flows from the top.
