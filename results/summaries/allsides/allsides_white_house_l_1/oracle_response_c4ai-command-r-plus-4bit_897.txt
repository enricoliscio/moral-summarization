SUMMARY: John Kelly, President Trump's chief of staff, has announced his resignation, ending a tumultuous tenure marked by chaos and disorder. Kelly's performance was characterized by a commitment to Trump's ideology, including tolerance for bigotry and cruelty. He displayed disdain and disrespect towards critics, particularly black female critics, and blamed the Civil War on a lack of compromise, praising Confederate figures. Kelly also showed indifference to domestic abuse allegations against a senior aide and defended the administration's "zero tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents, placing them in detention camps. Despite valuing normalcy and temperance, Kelly shared Trump's worldview, and his failure to control the president's impulses may have inadvertently prevented a more effective and disciplined ethnonationalist administration. Kelly's tenure teaches us that moderation is more than just appearance, and the ethos of an administration flows from its leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
