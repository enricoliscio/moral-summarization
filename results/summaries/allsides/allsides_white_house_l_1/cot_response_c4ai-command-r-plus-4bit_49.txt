SUMMARY:
John Kelly, the former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodied the ideological core of "Trumpism" and its tolerance for cruelty, bigotry, and bad behavior. Kelly's tenure was marked by controversies, including his spat with a black female critic, his praise for Confederate figures, and his indifference to allegations of domestic abuse against a senior aide. Most notably, Kelly defended and helped craft the administration's "zero tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents, displaying a callous disregard for human suffering. While Kelly was seen as a stabilizing force in the White House, his shared worldview with Trump underscores that moderation is superficial without a genuine ethical foundation. Kelly's failure to control the president ultimately spared the nation from a more disciplined and effective Trump, whose ethnonationalist instincts could have been fully realized. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that appearance alone does not constitute moderation, and the ethos of an administration is shaped by the moral character of its leader. END OF SUMMARY.
