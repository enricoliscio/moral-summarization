SUMMARY: In a recent news article, the author reflects on the tenure of John Kelly, who served as President Donald Trump's chief of staff for nearly two years. Despite being known as the "adult in the room," Kelly's performance reflected the same casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and indifference to ethical standards that define Trump's presidency. The article highlights several instances that demonstrate Kelly's alignment with Trump's worldview, including his disrespect towards black female critics, his defense of Confederate figures, and his indifference to allegations of domestic abuse against a senior aide. Most notably, Kelly was an architect of the administration's "zero-tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents at the border, a policy widely criticized for its cruelty. The author argues that even if Kelly had been able to control Trump's impulsive behavior, the administration's enthusiasm for cruelty and contempt for common decency would have remained. The key takeaway is that the appearance of moderation should not be confused with actual moderation, and the ethos of the Trump administration stems directly from the president himself.
