SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, will leave the White House as chaotic and disordered as it was when he took the job. Despite lacking Trump's intemperate attitude and undisciplined behavior, Kelly shares the president's ideology, including his casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and bad behavior. Kelly's tenure was marked by disdain for black female critics, blaming the Civil War on "the lack of ability to compromise," and praising Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." He also backed senior aide Rob Porter, accused of domestic abuse, calling him a "man of true integrity and honor." Kelly was indifferent to the charges, an attitude that might have made this the most consequential scandal of his tenure. Moreover, Kelly was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to child separation, displaying a succinct encapsulation of Trump's rotten ideology, from casual cruelty to bigotry behind the dehumanization of an entire class of people. Kelly's failure to control the president might be a blessing in disguise, as a more disciplined Trump would be a more effective one, translating his ethnonationalist instincts into concrete policy.

END OF SUMMARY.
