SUMMARY:
The article discusses the tenure of John Kelly as Chief of Staff to President Donald Trump and how he embodies the ideological elements of "Trumpism". Kelly's commitment to Trump's worldview, marked by casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and indifference to common decency, is highlighted. Kelly's disdain for black female critics of the administration and his defense of the Civil War's Confederate figures showcase his own intemperate and undisciplined behavior. The child separation policy at the US-Mexico border, which Kelly defended, exemplifies the rotten ideology of the Trump administration. Despite valuing normalcy and temperance, Kelly shares Trump's enthusiasm for cruelty and contempt. Kelly's failure to control the president may have inadvertently prevented a more disciplined and effective Trump, translating ethnonationalist instincts into policy. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not true moderation, and the ethos of an administration flows from its leader. Kelly's performance reveals that official Washington's desire for an "adult in the room" is overrated when the underlying ethos remains rotten.
