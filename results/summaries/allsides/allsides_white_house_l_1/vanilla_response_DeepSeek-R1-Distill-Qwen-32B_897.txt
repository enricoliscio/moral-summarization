Alright, I need to summarize this article about John F. Kelly's tenure as Trump's chief of staff. The article is pretty detailed, so I'll have to pick out the key points. 

First, I know Kelly is leaving his position by the end of the year. The article mentions that the White House remains chaotic, so that's a main point. 

Next, the article talks about Kelly's role in Trumpism. It's important to note that while he's more disciplined than Trump, he shares the same core beliefs. 

There are specific incidents mentioned: the spat with Rep. Wilson, where Kelly accused her of taking credit for an FBI building she didn't. That shows his tendency to dismiss critics, especially women of color. 

Then there's the Confederate General Robert E. Lee praise, which came after the Charlottesville rally. This highlights his problematic views on history and race. 

The Rob Porter scandal is another key point. Kelly defended Porter despite knowing about the protective order, showing his tolerance for bad behavior. 

Lastly, Kelly's role in the family separation policy is crucial. His casual attitude towards separating children from their parents encapsulates Trump's ideology. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too bogged down in details. I'll structure it to show Kelly's failures, his alignment with Trump's ideology despite seeming more moderate, and the impact of his tenure. 

I should also highlight that the administration's ethos comes from Trump, so even with Kelly, the policies remained harmful. The conclusion is that moderation in appearance doesn't mean moderation in action. 

Let me piece this together, ensuring each main point is covered briefly. I'll start with his departure, then touch on each incident, and end with the overall takeaway about the administration's nature.

SUMMARY: Retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, who served as President Donald Trump's chief of staff for nearly two years, announced his departure from the White House by the end of 2018. Despite his reputation as a "disciplined" figure, Kelly's tenure reflected Trump's chaotic administration and shared ideological underpinnings, including casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry. Key incidents include his confrontation with Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he falsely accused her of taking credit for an FBI building, and his praise for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, which came after the Charlottesville rally. Kelly also defended Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, despite knowing about a protective order against him. Most notably, Kelly was a key architect of Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to family separations. His casual dismissal of the policy's cruelty—despite being seen as a moderating influence—highlighted the administration's core ethos of dehumanization and bigotry, deeply rooted in Trump's leadership. Kelly's tenure underscores that the appearance of moderation does not equate to actual moderation, and the administration's problematic nature flows from Trump himself. END OF SUMMARY.
