Alright, I need to summarize this news article about John F. Kelly. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author provided. So, I should focus on the key points that highlight Kelly's role and the moral issues discussed.

First, the article talks about Kelly's tenure as Trump's chief of staff and how he embodies "Trumpism." I need to mention that he lacks Trump's impulsiveness but shares his ideology, like casual cruelty and tolerance of bigotry.

Next, the article gives specific examples: his confrontation with Rep. Wilson, his comments on the Civil War and Robert E. Lee, and his defense of Rob Porter despite domestic abuse allegations. These examples show his disregard for certain groups and problematic values.

Then, the article discusses Kelly's role in the "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separations. This is a major point because it ties into the moral critique of his actions and Trump's policies.

I should also note that while Kelly was seen as the "adult in the room," he didn't change the administration's ethos, which is tied to Trump's leadership. The summary should highlight that the administration's issues stem from Trump, not just Kelly's failures.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it captures the moral framing, emphasizing Kelly's alignment with Trump's problematic ideology despite his more temperate demeanor.
