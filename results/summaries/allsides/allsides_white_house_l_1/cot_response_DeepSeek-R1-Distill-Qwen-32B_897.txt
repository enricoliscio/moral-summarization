Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure: first, identify all single words with moral framing, then write a concise summary using those terms.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about John Kelly's tenure as Trump's chief of staff and his moral stance. The article highlights his actions and attitudes that reflect the moral framework.

For STEP 1, I need to pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "chaotic," "disordered," "intemperate," "undisciplined," "casual cruelty," "tolerance," "bigotry," "bad behavior," "empty barrel," "disdain," "disrespect," "honorable," "good faith," "tragedy," "both sides," "defend," "abuse," "outrageous," "protective order," "indifferent," "cruel," "heartless," "dehumanization," "rotten," "ethos," "ethnonationalist," and "discipline."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, using as many of these moral terms as possible. I should focus on Kelly's key actions and how they reflect his moral alignment with Trump's administration. I'll mention his spat with Wilson, the Confederate praise, the Porter scandal, and the child separation policy. Each of these points highlights his commitment to Trump's ideology despite his more tempered demeanor.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each event to show how Kelly's actions embody the administration's values. I'll end by emphasizing that his presence didn't change the administration's ethos, which is rooted in Trump's leadership.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and captures all the moral aspects without being too verbose. Each sentence should highlight a moral point, using the identified words where appropriate. I'll avoid adding any new information not present in the article and stick strictly to summarizing the given content.

**SUMMARY:**

John F. Kelly, President Trump's chief of staff, has left the White House amid chaos and disorder, embodying the essence of "Trumpism." Despite his tempered demeanor, Kelly shared Trump's worldview, marked by casual cruelty, tolerance of bigotry, and disregard for decency. This was evident in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he disrespected her and displayed disdain for black female critics. Kelly also defended Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man" and used "both sides" rhetoric following the Charlottesville tragedy, echoing Trump's problematic stance. He defended Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, showing indifference to the allegations. Kelly was also a key architect of the "zero tolerance" immigration policy, which led to child separation, shrugging off the cruelty of the practice. His tenure highlights that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, as the administration's ethos flows from Trump's ethnonationalist instincts. Kelly's failure to control Trump may have been a collective benefit, as a more disciplined Trump could have been more dangerous. END OF SUMMARY.
