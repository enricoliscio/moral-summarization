SUMMARY: John Kelly, President Trump's chief of staff, has announced his resignation, ending a tenure marked by chaos and disorder. Kelly's performance was characterized by a commitment to Trump's ideology, including casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and indifference to abuse allegations. Kelly displayed disdain and disrespect towards black female critics of the administration, such as Rep. Frederica Wilson, and made controversial remarks praising Confederate figures and blaming the Civil War on a lack of compromise. He also backed Rob Porter, an aide accused of domestic abuse, and defended the administration's "zero tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents. Kelly's tenure reveals that a moderate appearance does not equate to true moderation, and the ethos of an administration is shaped by its leader. Despite valuing normalcy and temperance, Kelly shared Trump's worldview, demonstrating that the Trump administration's enthusiasm for cruelty and contempt would persist even with a more disciplined leader.
END OF SUMMARY.
