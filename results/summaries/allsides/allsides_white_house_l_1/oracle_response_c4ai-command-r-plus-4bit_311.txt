SUMMARY: John Kelly, who served as chief of staff to President Trump for nearly two years, is set to leave the White House by the end of the year. Despite being known as the "adult in the room," Kelly's tenure was marked by a tolerance for bigotry, cruelty, and indifference to scandal. He refused to apologize for his disdainful treatment of black female critics, such as Rep. Frederica Wilson, and defended the president's insensitive comments toward a slain soldier's widow. Kelly also blamed the Civil War on a "lack of compromise," praising Confederate figures despite the conflict's roots in slavery expansion. He backed Rob Porter, an aide accused of domestic abuse, calling him a "man of true integrity." Most notably, Kelly was an architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy that separated immigrant children from their parents at the border, displaying indifference to the cruelty and dehumanization of families. Kelly's failure to control the president's impulses highlights that the appearance of moderation is not true moderation. His tenure underscores the importance of the administration's ethos, which ultimately reflects the man at the top.
END OF SUMMARY.
