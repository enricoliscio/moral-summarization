SUMMARY:

Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodies the Trump era's ideology, including casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disrespect for critics. Despite his commitment to normalcy and temperance, Kelly shares Trump's worldview, as seen in his spat with Rep. Frederica Wilson, where he accused her of taking false credit for an FBI field office construction, and refused to apologize. He also blamed the Civil War on a "lack of ability to compromise" and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Kelly's indifference to domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter and his defense of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy towards immigrants, resulting in child separation, further demonstrate his alignment with Trump's ideology. The lesson from Kelly's tenure is that the appearance of moderation is not moderation, and what matters is the administration's ethos, which flows from the top.

END OF SUMMARY.
