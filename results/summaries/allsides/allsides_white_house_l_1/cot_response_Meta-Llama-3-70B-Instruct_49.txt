SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has been a representative of "Trumpism" during his nearly two-year tenure. Despite his commitment to basic elements of the president's ideology, Kelly's performance has been marked by casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disrespect for black female critics. He has demonstrated a pattern of open disrespect, blaming the Civil War on "the lack of the ability to compromise" and praising Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly's defense of Rob Porter, a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, and his role in architecting the "zero tolerance" policy of child separation, further highlight his rotten ideology. While Kelly may value normalcy and temperance, his basic worldview aligns with Trump's, making his departure from the White House a welcome change. END OF SUMMARY.
