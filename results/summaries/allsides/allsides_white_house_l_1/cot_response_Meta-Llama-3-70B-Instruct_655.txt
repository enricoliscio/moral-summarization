SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, embodies the president's ideology, including his casual cruelty, tolerance for bigotry, and disdain for black female critics. Kelly's tenure was marked by his defense of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to the separation of immigrant children from their parents, calling it "not cruel and heartless." He also showed indifference to allegations of domestic abuse against a senior aide and praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." Kelly's commitment to Trump's ideology is evident in his actions, which demonstrate a rotten ethos that values cruelty and contempt over common decency. Despite his attempts to appear as a voice of moderation, Kelly's true nature reveals that the appearance of moderation is not moderation. END OF SUMMARY.
