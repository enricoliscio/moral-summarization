SUMMARY:
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, outgoing chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has been a representative of "Trumpism" in the White House. Despite lacking Trump's intemperate attitude, Kelly shares the president's ideology, including his casual cruelty and tolerance for bigotry and bad behavior. Kelly's tenure has been marked by open disrespect for black female critics, blaming the Civil War on a "lack of ability to compromise," and praising Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an "honorable man." He also defended a senior aide accused of domestic abuse, calling him a "man of true integrity and honor." Kelly was a key architect of the administration's "zero tolerance" policy, which led to the separation of children from their parents at the border, showing a cruel and heartless attitude. The author argues that Kelly's failure to control Trump's impulses may have been a blessing in disguise, as a more disciplined Trump would have been more effective in translating his rotten ideology into policy.
