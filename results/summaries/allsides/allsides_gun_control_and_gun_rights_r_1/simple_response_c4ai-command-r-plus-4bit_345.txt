SUMMARY: In a shocking display of moral failure, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, even as Baltimore mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients. The bill, proposed by Republican governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including those who steal firearms or use guns while drug dealing. Despite the bill's bipartisan nature and overwhelming public support, Democrats in the state legislature voted it down, prioritizing their ideological opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing over the safety of their constituents. Their callous decision undermines public safety and sends a message that the Democratic Party is more concerned with protecting criminals than supporting law-abiding citizens and victims of gun violence. This is a moral outrage and a failure of leadership that puts the people of Maryland at risk. End of summary.
END OF SUMMARY.
