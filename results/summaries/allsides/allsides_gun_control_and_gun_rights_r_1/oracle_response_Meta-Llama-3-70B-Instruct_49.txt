SUMMARY: 

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other, so hospitals could focus on treating coronavirus patients. The rejected bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making the theft of a firearm a felony and increasing penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use a gun while drug dealing. Democrats removed the bill's mandatory minimum sentencing increase, arguing it would punish violent criminals too severely. Meanwhile, violent crime spiked in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night, prompting Young to urge residents to stop the senseless violence, which is "completely unacceptable" and could clog up hospitals needed for coronavirus patients. GOP lawmakers accused Democrats of undermining public safety and giving a break to criminals who use firearms to sell drugs.
