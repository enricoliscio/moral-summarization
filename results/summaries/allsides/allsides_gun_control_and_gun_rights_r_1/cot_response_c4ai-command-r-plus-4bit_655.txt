SUMMARY: 
Baltimore mayor Jack Young, a Democrat, publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could be used to treat coronavirus patients. Young pleaded with residents not to "clog up" hospitals with gunshot victims, as the city's health system prepared for an influx of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, the same day as Young's plea, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence by strengthening penalties for violent criminals. The bill, known as the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was pushed by Republican governor Larry Hogan and had passed the state Senate with bipartisan support. However, Democrats in the House voted it down, expressing concerns that it punished violent criminals too severely. This decision left many disappointed, including Hogan, who cited an internal poll showing overwhelming support for the bill among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. The rejection of the bill came as violent crime spiked in Baltimore, with the city's police commissioner calling the level of violence "completely unacceptable." Young reiterated his plea for an end to the violence, urging residents to consider the need for hospital beds for coronavirus patients and to "take that into consideration."
END OF SUMMARY.
