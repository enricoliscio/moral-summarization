SUMMARY:
Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other as Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence. Young, a Democrat, pleaded with residents not to clog up hospitals with shooting victims, as the state needs to focus on treating coronavirus patients. The mayor's pleas came as his party members in the state legislature voted down Governor Larry Hogan's Violent Firearms Offenders Act, which aimed to strengthen penalties for violent criminals. The bill, which was supported by an overwhelming majority of Baltimore residents, would have made the theft of a firearm a felony and increased penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use a gun while drug dealing. 

State Senate Democrats successfully removed the mandatory minimum sentencing increase from the bill, arguing it would be too severe for violent criminals. Despite the removal of mandatory minimums and the bill's passage in the state Senate, the House of Representatives failed to pass it before adjourning due to the coronavirus crisis. The rejection of the bill has disappointed some lawmakers, who feel that the state has not adequately addressed the issue of crime. Baltimore's violent crime rate has spiked recently, with Mayor Young reiterating that the level of violence is completely unacceptable.
