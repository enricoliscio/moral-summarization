SUMMARY: Despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's pleas for residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence. The bill, supported by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including those who use guns while drug dealing. While the bill initially passed the state Senate with bipartisan support after removing mandatory minimum sentencing, it was ultimately rejected by the Democrat-controlled House. This decision disappointed some lawmakers who felt more needed to be done to address the state's crime issue. Baltimore has seen a spike in violent crime, with seven people shot in a single night, adding pressure on hospitals already strained by the pandemic. Mayor Young's plea highlights the competing demands on the city's resources as it grapples with both the coronavirus crisis and persistent gun violence.
END OF SUMMARY.
