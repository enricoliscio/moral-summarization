SUMMARY: As Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could treat coronavirus patients, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill that would have strengthened penalties for violent gun-related crimes. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, aimed to reduce gun violence by increasing penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use guns in drug dealing. Despite the bill's popularity among Baltimore residents and the city's recent spike in violent crime, Democrats in the state legislature voted it down, with some arguing that it would punish violent criminals too severely. This decision left some lawmakers disappointed, feeling that more could have been done to address the issue of crime in the state. The Democratic majority's actions undermined public safety and sent a message that the party is more concerned with lenient punishment for violent criminals than with protecting law-abiding citizens. In the face of a global pandemic, the rejection of this bill demonstrates a shocking lack of concern for the well-being and safety of the people of Baltimore, as well as a disregard for the pleas of their own mayor.
END OF SUMMARY.
