SUMMARY: Despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's pleas for residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence and strengthening penalties for violent criminals. The bill, known as the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was supported by Republican Governor Larry Hogan and would have increased penalties for gun-related crimes such as theft, illegal carrying, and drug dealing. The bill passed the state Senate after removing mandatory minimum sentencing increases, but was ultimately rejected by the Democratic-controlled House. This decision has been criticized by some lawmakers and residents, who argue that it undermines public safety and fails to address the issue of crime in the state. Baltimore, already the nation's deadliest large city, has seen a recent spike in violent crime, with seven people shot in a single night. Mayor Young's plea for an end to the senseless shootings highlights the urgent need to address gun violence and ensure the safety and well-being of the community during this public health crisis.
