Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about Maryland Democrats rejecting a gun violence bill while the Baltimore mayor is asking people to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Hogan, aimed to increase penalties for violent criminals using firearms. Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentences, which led to the bill's failure.

I should highlight the moral conflict: Democrats opposing stricter penalties despite public support and the mayor's plea. It's important to show the tension between their stance and the public's desire for safety. Also, mention the internal poll showing high support for the bill, which adds to the moral dilemma.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: the rejection of the bill, the mayor's plea, the reasons behind the rejection, the public support, and the disappointment from Republicans. I should make sure the moral framing is clear, showing the contrast between the legislative action and the public's need.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the rejection, mention the mayor's request, explain the bill's content, the Democrats' amendment, the outcomes, and the public reaction. Conclude with the disappointment and the moral implications.

I should avoid any bias but present the facts in a way that shows the moral issue. Make sure it's concise and captures all necessary elements without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young urging residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, sought to strengthen penalties for violent criminals, including those who steal firearms or use them in drug deals. Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentences, arguing they were too harsh, leading to the bill's failure. State Senator Bill Ferguson praised the bipartisan effort, but House Minority Leader Nic Kipke called the rejection a disappointment, citing unaddressed crime issues. GOP senators accused Democrats of weakening public safety measures, while an internal poll showed 85% of Baltimore residents and 84% of African Americans statewide supported the bill. Violent crime has surged in Baltimore, with the mayor emphasizing the need to focus on the pandemic rather than gun violence. The legislative session ended without addressing the issue, highlighting a moral conflict between legislative priorities and public safety concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
