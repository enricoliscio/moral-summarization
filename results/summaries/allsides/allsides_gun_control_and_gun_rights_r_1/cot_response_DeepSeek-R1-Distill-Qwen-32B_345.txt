Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a news article and want me to summarize it while preserving the moral framing. They also want me to first identify all the morally framed single words in the text.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the context. It's about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence, while the Baltimore mayor is pleading for residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Hogan, aimed to strengthen penalties for violent criminals but was opposed by Democrats, who removed mandatory minimums. The article mentions support for the bill among Baltimore residents and African Americans, and the legislative process's contentious nature.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to identify all single words that carry moral framing. These are words that evoke values, judgments, or ethical considerations. Let me go through the text again.

Looking at the article, words like "rejected," "begged," "stop," "clog," "senselessly," "pleaded," "clogged," "senselessly," "rejected," "opposition," "undermine," "disappointment," "spiked," "unacceptable," "stand," "break," "focus," "completely unacceptable," "mass shootings," "increase," "clogged," "relatives," "consideration," "spiked," "unacceptable," "stand," "break," "focus," "completely unacceptable," "mass shootings," "increase," "clogged," "relatives," "consideration."

Wait, I should make sure each word is a single word and is used in a moral context. For example, "rejected" implies opposition, "begged" shows desperation, "stop" is an appeal to cease harmful actions, etc. I'll list each one as per the user's instruction, each on a new line with a *.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words, preserving as many morally framed words as possible. I'll start by outlining the main points: Democrats rejected the bill, the mayor's plea, the bill's provisions, the legislative battle, public support, and the consequences of not addressing crime.

I'll ensure that words like "rejected," "begged," "stop," "clog," "senselessly," "opposition," "undermine," "disappointment," "spiked," "unacceptable," "stand," "break," "focus," "completely unacceptable," "mass shootings," "increase," "clogged," "relatives," "consideration" are included where appropriate.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too verbose. I'll structure it to first mention the rejection, then the mayor's plea, the bill's details, the legislative process, public opinion, and the impact on crime and hospitals.

I should also ensure that the moral framing is clear, showing the conflict between Democrats and Republicans, the public's support, and the urgency due to the pandemic.

Alright, I think I have a good plan. I'll proceed to list the morally framed words first, then craft the summary accordingly.

**SUMMARY:**  
Maryland Democrats rejected a bill proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan to combat gun violence, despite public support for the legislation. The bill, which aimed to strengthen penalties for violent criminals, was amended to remove mandatory minimum sentences, a move criticized by Republicans as undermining public safety. Meanwhile, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young pleaded with residents to stop the violence, as hospitals were being "clogged" with gunshot victims, diverting resources from the coronavirus pandemic. The legislative session ended without addressing the "unacceptable" spike in crime, leaving many, including Democrats and Republicans, feeling "disappointed." GOP senators accused Democrats of gutting the bill, while Hogan's office highlighted widespread support for the legislation among Baltimore residents and African Americans. The failure to pass the bill was seen as a missed opportunity to address the "senselessly" rising violence and its impact on public health. END OF SUMMARY.
