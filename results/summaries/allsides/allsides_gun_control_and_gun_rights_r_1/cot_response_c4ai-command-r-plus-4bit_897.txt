SUMMARY:
Baltimore mayor Jack Young, a Democrat, publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other and contribute to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic by freeing up hospital beds. Young's pleas came as his party members in the state legislature voted down a bill aimed at combating gun violence by strengthening penalties for violent criminals and increasing mandatory minimum sentences. The bill, known as the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was supported by Republican governor Larry Hogan and was intended to address the spike in violent crime in Baltimore, one of the deadliest large cities in the nation. 

Despite the removal of mandatory minimums, which some Democrats argued would be too severe, the bill was still rejected. State lawmakers adjourned without passing any legislation to address the issue of crime in the state, a disappointing outcome for many, including House Minority Leader Nic Kipke and Democrat state senator Will Smith Jr. GOP senators accused Democrats of attempting to gut the bill even further with amendments that would have reduced penalties for drug dealers who use guns and criminals who steal firearms. 

Baltimore residents overwhelmingly supported the bill, with 85% in favor, yet the city continues to struggle with violent crime. Mayor Young reiterated that the level of violence is unacceptable and that hospitals cannot afford to be clogged with senseless shootings when they are needed to treat those infected with coronavirus. 

END OF SUMMARY.
