SUMMARY: In a time of crisis, with the coronavirus pandemic stretching hospitals to their limits, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill that aimed to combat gun violence and strengthen penalties for violent criminals. The bill, known as the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was pushed by Republican governor Larry Hogan and aimed to reduce theft of firearms and increase penalties for those who carry or use illegal guns. Baltimore mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop the senseless shooting, as the city's hospitals are already overwhelmed. The pleading came as Young's Democratic partymates in the state legislature voted down the bill, with state Senate president Bill Ferguson arguing that it would punish violent criminals too severely. This rejection comes despite the bill's popularity among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. In the wake of the bill's failure, concerns have been raised about the lack of attention to the issue of crime in the state, with the recent spike in violent crime in Baltimore highlighting the urgency of the situation. The actions of the Democrats have been criticized by GOP state senators, who accused them of undermining public safety by proposing amendments that would reduce penalties for drug dealers who use guns and criminals who steal firearms. The Democrats' actions are a disappointing response to a pressing issue, and their failure to pass this bill highlights a concerning disregard for the safety of their constituents.
END OF SUMMARY.
