Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article talks about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence. Meanwhile, Baltimore's mayor, Jack Young, is urging residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals can focus on coronavirus patients. The bill, called the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was pushed by Republican governor Larry Hogan. It would have made stealing a firearm a felony and increased penalties for those with illegal guns or drug dealers using guns. 

The Democrats removed the mandatory minimum sentences from the bill, arguing it was too harsh. Despite that, the bill passed the Senate but was rejected by the House. The Democrats' actions were criticized by Republicans, who accused them of weakening the bill. Public opinion was in favor of the bill, especially in Baltimore and among African Americans. 

The moral framing here seems to be about the Democrats' priorities and whether they're putting public safety at risk by rejecting the bill. There's a contrast between the mayor's plea for peace and the legislative action (or lack thereof). 

I need to capture this in a concise summary, under 200 words, highlighting the conflict between the Democrats' actions and the public's safety concerns. I should mention the bill's details, the Democrats' amendments, the public support, and the criticism from Republicans. Also, note the timing with the coronavirus crisis and the mayor's plea. 

Let me structure this step by step. Start with the rejection of the bill, mention the mayor's plea, explain the bill's provisions, the Democrats' amendments, the passage in the Senate, the House rejection, public support, Republican criticism, and the moral implication of putting public safety at risk. 

I should make sure to keep it clear and within the word limit. Let me try to draft that.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite public support and a plea from Baltimore Mayor Jack Young to reduce violence to free up hospital resources for COVID-19 patients. Republican Governor Larry Hogan's Violent Firearms Offenders Act sought to increase penalties for firearm thefts and drug-related gun crimes. Democrats amended the bill to remove mandatory minimum sentences, arguing against harsh penalties, leading to its rejection in the House. Republicans criticized the move, accusing Democrats of prioritizing leniency over public safety. The bill had strong support in Baltimore and among African Americans. The legislative failure drew criticism as violent crime surged, with the mayor emphasizing the need for peace to address the pandemic. The rejection highlighted a clash between legislative priorities and public safety concerns. END OF SUMMARY.
