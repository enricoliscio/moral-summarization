SUMMARY:
Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, a Democrat, publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other, so hospitals could treat coronavirus patients. Young pleaded with residents not to "clog [hospitals] up with people [who] are being shot senselessly," as the city is in dire need of beds for those infected with COVID-19. Unfortunately, on the same day, his Democratic partymates in the state legislature rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence by strengthening penalties for violent criminals. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have made the theft of a firearm a felony and increased penalties for those carrying illegal guns or using guns while drug dealing. Despite the bill's passage in the state Senate, it was ultimately voted down in the House, with Democrats arguing that mandatory minimum sentencing increases would punish criminals too severely. This decision disappointed many, including Hogan, who had an overwhelmingly popular bill among Baltimore residents, and state lawmakers who felt they had not done enough to address the issue of crime. Baltimore's violent crime rate spiked in the last week, with seven people shot in one night, highlighting the urgency of the situation. Young's plea for residents to stop the senseless violence and consider the need for hospital beds during this pandemic fell on deaf ears as the legislative session adjourned without addressing these concerns.
