SUMMARY:

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other, as hospitals need to focus on treating coronavirus patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making the theft of a firearm a felony and increasing penalties for repeat offenders. Democrats removed the mandatory minimum sentencing increase, arguing it was too severe. The bill passed the state Senate but was rejected by the House of Delegates. Republicans accused Democrats of gutting the legislation, while Democrats expressed discontent, saying more needs to be done to address crime in the state. The rejection of the bill comes as violent crime spikes in Baltimore, with 85% of residents supporting the bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
