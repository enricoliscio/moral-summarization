Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence. Meanwhile, Baltimore's mayor, Jack Young, is urging residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals can focus on COVID-19 patients.

The bill in question is Governor Larry Hogan's Violent Firearms Offenders Act. It would make stealing a firearm a felony and increase penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use them in drug dealing. The bill passed the state Senate but was rejected by the House. Democrats removed the mandatory minimum sentences, arguing they were too harsh.

The article also mentions that the bill was popular among Baltimore residents and African Americans, with 85% and 84% support respectively. However, the Democrats' amendments weakened the bill, leading to criticism from Republicans who felt public safety was compromised.

I should highlight the key elements: the rejection of the bill, the context of the mayor's plea, the主要内容 of the bill, the Democrats' amendments, the public support, and the criticism from Republicans. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the essential points without getting too detailed.
