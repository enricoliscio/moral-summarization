SUMMARY:
As Baltimore faces a surge in violent crime, Mayor Jack Young publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other, urging them to consider the senseless violence that is clogging up hospitals and beds needed for coronavirus patients. Meanwhile, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, which would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. The bill, supported by 85% of Baltimore residents and 84% of African Americans statewide, was seen as a crucial step in addressing the city's unacceptable level of violence. However, Democrats successfully removed the bill's mandatory minimum sentencing increase, arguing it would punish violent criminals too severely. The failure to pass the bill was seen as one of the disappointments of the legislative session, with Republicans accusing Democrats of attempting to gut the legislation and undermine public safety.
