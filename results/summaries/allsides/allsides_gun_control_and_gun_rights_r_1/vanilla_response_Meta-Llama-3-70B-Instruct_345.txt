SUMMARY:

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for repeated illegal gun carriers and drug dealers. Democrats removed the bill's mandatory minimum sentencing increase, arguing it was too harsh. The bill's failure to pass was met with disappointment from both parties, with Republicans accusing Democrats of undermining public safety. The move comes as violent crime surges in Baltimore, with 85% of residents and 84% of African Americans statewide supporting the bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
