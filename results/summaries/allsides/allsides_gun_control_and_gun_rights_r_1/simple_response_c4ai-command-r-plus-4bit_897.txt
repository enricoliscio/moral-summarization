SUMMARY: In the midst of the coronavirus crisis, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other so that hospitals could treat COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, the same day, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill that would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including those who use guns while drug dealing. The bill, supported by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, was aimed at reducing gun violence and improving public safety. While the bill passed the state Senate, it was voted down in the House by Democrats who argued that mandatory minimum sentencing increases would be too severe. This decision comes as violent crime spikes in Baltimore, with Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison reporting an increase in mass shootings and crime. Mayor Young's plea for residents to stop the violence highlights the dire need for hospitals to focus on the pandemic. The rejection of the bill by Maryland Democrats undermines efforts to improve public safety and reduce gun violence, especially in a time of crisis.
