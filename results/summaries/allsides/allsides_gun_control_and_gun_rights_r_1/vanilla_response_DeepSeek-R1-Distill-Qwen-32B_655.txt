Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Maryland Democrats rejecting a gun violence bill while the Baltimore mayor is asking people to stop shooting. Let me read through the article again to get the key points.

So, the main events are: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill proposed by Republican governor Larry Hogan aimed at combating gun violence. This happened on the same day that Baltimore mayor Jack Young pleaded with residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could focus on COVID-19 patients.

The bill, called the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, would have made stealing a firearm a felony and increased penalties for those carrying illegal guns or using them in drug deals. It passed the Senate but Democrats removed the mandatory minimum sentences, arguing they were too harsh. The Senate president, a Democrat, praised the bipartisan effort, but the House rejected it.

The bill had strong public support, especially in Baltimore, with 85% support. Despite this, the Democrats voted it down, which some Republicans criticized as prioritizing politics over public safety. The legislative session ended due to the pandemic, leaving crime issues unresolved.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the rejection of the bill and the context of the mayor's plea. Then mention the bill's provisions and the Democrats' amendments. Highlight the public support and the political criticism. Finally, note the session ending without addressing crime.

I should make sure to include the key points: who rejected the bill, what the bill entailed, the amendments, public support, criticism, and the outcome. Keep it concise and clear.
