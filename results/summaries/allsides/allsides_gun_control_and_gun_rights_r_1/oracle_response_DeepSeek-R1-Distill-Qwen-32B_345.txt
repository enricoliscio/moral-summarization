Alright, so the user has provided a query where they want a news summary that preserves the moral framing from the original article. They've specified that I should use as many of the morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start and end with specific tokens.

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. It's about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence while the Baltimore mayor is urging residents to stop shootings to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Hogan, aimed to strengthen penalties for violent criminals. Democrats removed mandatory minimums, which led to the bill's passage in the Senate but rejection in the House. Public support for the bill was high, especially in Baltimore. The rejection is seen as a disappointment by some lawmakers.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article: violence, shooting, treat, shot, voted, strengthen, theft, increase, carry, use, dealing, addressed, steal, crime, undermined, pushing, giving, sell, shootings.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning the rejection of the bill, then the mayor's plea. I'll note the bill's aim to strengthen penalties, the Democrats' removal of mandatory minimums, and the eventual rejection. I'll include the public support and the disappointment from lawmakers. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, connecting the political action with the public health plea. Highlighting the moral implications, such as the impact on hospitals and the failure to address crime, will maintain the framing. I'll also mention the bipartisan nature and the amendments that weakened the bill, using words like 'undermined' and'steal' where relevant.

Finally, I'll make sure to end with the specified tokens and keep the language clear and direct, preserving the moral tone from the original article.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore mayor Jack Young urging residents to stop shootings to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The bill, proposed by Republican governor Larry Hogan, sought to strengthen penalties for violent criminals, including those who steal firearms or use guns in drug dealing. However, Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentences, arguing the penalties were too severe. The bill passed the state Senate but was ultimately rejected by the House. GOP senators accused Democrats of undermining public safety by gutting the legislation. Despite widespread public support, including 85% of Baltimore residents and 84% of African Americans statewide, the bill failed. The rejection was seen as a disappointment, as violent crime has spiked in Baltimore, with seven people shot in one night. Young emphasized the unacceptable level of violence and urged residents to stop shootings to protect hospital resources for COVID-19 patients. END OF SUMMARY.
