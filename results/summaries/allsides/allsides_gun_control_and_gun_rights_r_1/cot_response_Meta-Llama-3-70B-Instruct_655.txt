SUMMARY:
As Baltimore faces a surge in violent crime, Mayor Jack Young publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other, so hospitals can focus on treating coronavirus patients. Meanwhile, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, which would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have made the theft of a firearm a felony and increased penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use a gun while drug dealing. Democrats argued that the bill's mandatory minimum sentencing increase would punish violent criminals too severely. The failure to pass the bill is seen as a "disappointment" by many, who believe it undermines public safety. The move is particularly concerning given that 85% of Baltimore residents and 84% of African Americans statewide supported the bill. END OF SUMMARY.
