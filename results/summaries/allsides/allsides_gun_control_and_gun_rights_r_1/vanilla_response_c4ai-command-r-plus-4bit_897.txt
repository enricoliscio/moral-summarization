SUMMARY: Despite Baltimore mayor Jack Young's pleas for residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence. The bill, supported by Republican governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including those who use guns while drug dealing or steal firearms. While the bill initially passed the state Senate with bipartisan support after removing mandatory minimum sentencing increases, it was ultimately rejected by the Democrat-controlled House. This decision disappointed some lawmakers who felt more needed to be done to address the state's crime issues. Baltimore has seen a recent spike in violent crime, and Young urged residents to consider the need for hospital beds during the pandemic. The rejection of the bill by Democrats was criticized by Republicans, who accused them of undermining public safety. An internal poll suggested the bill was widely popular among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide.
