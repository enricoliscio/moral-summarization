SUMMARY:

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other, as hospitals need to focus on treating coronavirus patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for repeat offenders. Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentencing increases, arguing it would punish violent criminals too severely. The bill's rejection was met with disappointment from both parties, with Republicans accusing Democrats of undermining public safety. The bill was overwhelmingly popular among Baltimore residents, with 85% indicating support. Meanwhile, violent crime has spiked in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night, prompting Young's plea to residents to stop the violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
