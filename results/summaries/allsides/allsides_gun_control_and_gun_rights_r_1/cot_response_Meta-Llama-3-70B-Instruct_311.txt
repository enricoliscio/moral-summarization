SUMMARY:
As Baltimore faces a surge in violent crime, Mayor Jack Young publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other, emphasizing that hospitals need to focus on treating coronavirus patients. However, on the same day, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, which would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, had overwhelming support from Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. Democrats argued that the bill's mandatory minimum sentencing increase would punish violent criminals too severely. The rejection of the bill is seen as a "disappointment" by some lawmakers, who feel that it undermines public safety. The move is particularly concerning as violent crime continues to spike in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night alone. Young urged residents to consider the "unacceptable" level of violence, which could have devastating consequences for coronavirus patients. END OF SUMMARY.
