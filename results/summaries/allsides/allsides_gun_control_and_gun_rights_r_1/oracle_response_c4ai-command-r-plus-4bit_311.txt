SUMMARY: Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other and contributing to the city's violent crime problem, as the city's hospitals prepared for an influx of coronavirus patients. This plea came as Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at reducing gun violence by strengthening penalties for violent criminals. The bill, known as the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was supported by Republican Governor Larry Hogan and had broad popular support, including among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. Despite the removal of mandatory minimum sentencing increases, which Democrats argued would be too severe, the bill was still voted down by the Democratic-controlled House. This decision left many disappointed, including some Democrats, who acknowledged that more needed to be done to address the state's crime problem. Amendments offered by Democrats during the legislative process were criticized by Republicans as undermining public safety, as they removed penalty enhancements for various gun-related crimes. Baltimore's violent crime rate spiked in the last week, with seven people shot in a single night, adding to the strain on the city's healthcare system. Mayor Young's plea to residents reflected the urgent need to reduce gun violence and free up hospital resources to treat those affected by the pandemic. 

END OF SUMMARY.
