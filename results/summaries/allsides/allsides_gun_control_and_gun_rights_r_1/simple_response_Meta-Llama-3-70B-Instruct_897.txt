SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of moral inconsistency, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, even as Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The rejected bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. Democrats claimed the bill was too harsh, but their actions are hypocritical given their support for legislation that would jail people for not complying with firearm transfer laws. The rejected bill had overwhelming support from Baltimore residents, with 85% indicating they wanted tougher penalties for violent criminals. Meanwhile, violent crime has spiked in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night alone. The mayor's plea for residents to stop the senseless violence fell on deaf ears, as Democrats prioritized leniency for criminals over public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
