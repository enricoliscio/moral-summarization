SUMMARY:

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for repeat offenders. Democrats removed the mandatory minimum sentencing increase, arguing it was too harsh. The bill passed the state Senate but was rejected by the House of Delegates. Republicans accused Democrats of undermining public safety, while Democrats expressed discontent that more wasn't done to address crime. The rejection of the bill comes as violent crime spikes in Baltimore, with 85% of residents and 84% of African Americans statewide supporting the bill.

END OF SUMMARY.
