SUMMARY:

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could focus on treating coronavirus patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for repeat offenders. Democrats removed the mandatory minimum sentencing increase, arguing it was too harsh. The bill passed the state Senate but was rejected by the House of Delegates. Republicans accused Democrats of gutting the legislation and undermining public safety. The bill was popular among Baltimore residents, with 85% supporting it. Meanwhile, violent crime has spiked in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night, prompting Young's plea to stop the violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
