SUMMARY: A bill aimed at combating gun violence in Maryland was rejected by Democrats, despite pleas from Baltimore mayor Jack Young for residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients. The bill, known as the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was supported by Republican governor Larry Hogan and included measures such as making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for those carrying illegal guns or using guns while drug dealing. While the bill initially passed the state Senate with amendments removing mandatory minimum sentencing increases, it was ultimately rejected by the Democrat-controlled House. This decision came as violent crime spiked in Baltimore, with mayor Young urging residents to stop the violence and free up hospital resources for COVID-19 patients. The rejection of the bill was criticized by some lawmakers, who felt that more needed to be done to address the issue of crime in the state. Amendments proposed by Democrats in the Judicial Proceedings Committee were also criticized by Republicans as undermining public safety. Polls showed high support for the bill among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide.
END OF SUMMARY.
