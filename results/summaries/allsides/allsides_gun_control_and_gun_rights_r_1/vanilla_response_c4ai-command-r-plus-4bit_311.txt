SUMMARY: Despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's pleas for residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for illegal gun use. State Senate Democrats successfully removed mandatory minimum sentencing provisions from the bill, arguing they were too severe, and the amended bill passed the Senate. However, the House, led by Speaker Adrienne Jones, failed to act on the bill before the legislature adjourned due to the coronavirus crisis. House Minority Leader Nic Kipke expressed disappointment at the failure to address crime in the state, while Democrat state senator Will Smith Jr. acknowledged that more needed to be done. GOP state senators accused Democrats of attempting to weaken the bill even further through amendments. An internal poll showed strong support for Hogan's bill among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. Baltimore has seen a spike in violent crime, with Mayor Young urging residents to stop the violence and consider the need for hospital resources during the pandemic.
END OF SUMMARY.
