Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. It's about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence, while the Baltimore mayor is asking residents to stop shooting to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Hogan, would make firearm theft a felony and increase penalties for those carrying illegal guns or using them in drug deals. Democrats removed mandatory minimums, which they thought were too harsh. The bill passed the Senate but was rejected in the House. Public opinion supports the bill, especially in Baltimore. The summary needs to include the morally framed words like violence, shooting, treat, etc., and be concise, under 200 words.

I should start by identifying the key events: the bill's rejection, the mayor's plea, the details of the bill, the Democrats' actions, the public support, and the legislative session ending. I need to ensure that the moral aspects are highlighted, such as the violence, the impact on hospitals, and the legislative failure to address crime. I'll structure the summary to flow from the mayor's plea to the legislative action and its implications. I'll make sure to include the opposition from Democrats and the public's support for the bill. Finally, I'll end with the disappointment expressed by the minority leader, emphasizing the failure to address crime.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan to combat gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young urging residents to stop shooting to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The bill, the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, aimed to strengthen penalties for violent criminals by making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for those carrying illegal guns or using them in drug deals. However, Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentencing increases, arguing they were too harsh. The bill passed the state Senate but was rejected in the House, with Democrats accused by Republicans of undermining public safety. Despite 85% support among Baltimore residents and 84% among African Americans statewide, the legislation failed. Mayor Young emphasized the unacceptable level of violence, urging residents to stop the shooting to allow hospitals to treat coronavirus patients. The legislative session ended without addressing the crime issue, leaving many, including House Minority Leader Nic Kipke, disappointed. END OF SUMMARY.
