SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of prioritizing leniency over public safety, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, even as Baltimore Mayor Jack Young pleaded with residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The rejected bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for repeat offenders. Democrats claimed the bill was too harsh, but their actions are morally reprehensible, especially given the overwhelming support for the bill among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. By choosing to coddle criminals, Democrats have put the lives of innocent people at risk, including those who may need hospital care for COVID-19. The moral imperative to protect human life and safety has been callously disregarded in favor of a misguided ideology. END OF SUMMARY.
