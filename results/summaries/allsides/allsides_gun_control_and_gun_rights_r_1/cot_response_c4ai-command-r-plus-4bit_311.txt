SUMMARY:
Baltimore mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could treat coronavirus patients. Young, a Democrat, pleaded with residents not to "clog up our hospitals and beds with people [who] are being shot senselessly." He emphasized that the beds are needed for people infected with coronavirus and could be needed for their relatives. Unfortunately, his pleas came as his Democratic partymates in the state legislature rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence by strengthening penalties for violent criminals. The bill, known as the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was pushed by Republican governor Larry Hogan and had received support from a majority of Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. The bill would have made the theft of a firearm a felony and increased penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use them while drug dealing. Despite the bipartisan support for the bill in the state Senate, it was ultimately voted down in the House, with Democrats arguing that it would punish violent criminals too severely. This rejection came at a time when violent crime in Baltimore, already the nation's deadliest large city, was spiking. The mayor's pleas and the failure to pass this bill highlight the moral dilemma between protecting public health and ensuring public safety during a time of crisis.
END OF SUMMARY.
