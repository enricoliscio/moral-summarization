Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a specific structure: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a concise summary.

First, I need to understand the article. It's about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence while the Baltimore mayor is pleading for residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, pushed by Republican governor Larry Hogan, would increase penalties for violent criminals. The Democrats removed mandatory minimums, which led to the bill's failure. Public opinion supported the bill, but the Democrats opposed it, leading to criticism from Republicans and disappointment from some Democrats.

Now, for STEP 1, I need to identify all the single words that carry moral framing. I'll go through the article and pick out words that express approval, disapproval, or moral judgment. Words like "rejected," "begged," "clog," "senselessly," "critisized," "opposed," "disappointment," "undermine," "spiked," "unacceptable," "stand," "break," "focus," "completely unacceptable," "mass shootings," "increase," "clog," "relatives," "consideration," "spiked," "unacceptable," "stand," "break," "focus," "completely unacceptable," "mass shootings," "increase," "clog," "relatives," "consideration."

Next, I need to write the summary, preserving as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the rejection of the bill, the mayor's plea, the bill's purpose, the Democrats' actions, the criticism, and the public support. I'll make sure to include the key morally charged words to reflect the author's framing.

I should ensure that the summary flows well and captures all the essential points without being too verbose. I'll also check that the morally framed words are included to maintain the original moral perspective of the article.

Finally, I'll structure the response as per the user's instructions, starting with STEP 1, listing each morally framed word, then providing the summary after the "SUMMARY:" token, and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

**SUMMARY:**  
Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore mayor Jack Young pleading for residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The bill, pushed by Republican governor Larry Hogan, sought to strengthen penalties for violent criminals but was gutted by Democrats who removed mandatory minimum sentencing. Critics accused Democrats of undermining public safety, as violent crime spiked in Baltimore. Despite bipartisan support and public backing, the bill failed, leaving many disappointed. The mayor emphasized the unacceptable level of violence, urging residents to stop the senseless shootings so hospitals could focus on the pandemic. END OF SUMMARY.
