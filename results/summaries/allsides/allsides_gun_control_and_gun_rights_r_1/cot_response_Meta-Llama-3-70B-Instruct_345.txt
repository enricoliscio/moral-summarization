SUMMARY:
Baltimore Mayor Jack Young publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other, as hospitals need to focus on treating coronavirus patients. However, on the same day, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, which would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have made the theft of a firearm a felony and increased penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use a gun while drug dealing. Democrats argued that the bill's mandatory minimum sentencing increase would punish violent criminals too severely. The failure to pass the bill is seen as a "disappointment" by many, as violent crime continues to spike in Baltimore. Young urged residents to stop the "senseless" violence, as hospitals need to be available for coronavirus patients. END OF SUMMARY.
