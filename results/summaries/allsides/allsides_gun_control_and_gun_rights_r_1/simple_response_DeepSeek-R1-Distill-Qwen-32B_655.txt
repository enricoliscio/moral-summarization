Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, included measures like making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for those using guns in drug deals. Democrats opposed the bill, particularly objecting to mandatory minimum sentences, which they felt were too harsh. They amended the bill to remove these mandatory minimums, leading to its passage in the Senate but eventual rejection in the House.

Meanwhile, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, a Democrat, pleaded with residents to stop the violence to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. Despite public support for the bill, especially in Baltimore, the Democrats' actions were criticized by Republicans as prioritizing leniency over public safety.

I need to ensure the summary captures the moral implications: Democrats' stance on sentencing versus public safety, the contrast between the mayor's plea and legislative action, and the public's support for the bill. I'll structure the summary to highlight these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words.

I'll start by stating the rejection of the bill, then explain the bill's provisions and the Democrats' objections. Next, I'll mention the mayor's plea and the criticism from Republicans. Finally, I'll include the public support and the outcome of the legislative session.

I should avoid any personal opinions and stick to the facts while maintaining the moral framing as presented in the article. I'll make sure the summary flows logically and covers all critical aspects without being too detailed.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan aimed at combating gun violence, despite public support and a plea from Baltimore Mayor Jack Young to reduce violence to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, which would have made firearm theft a felony and increased penalties for gun-related crimes, passed the state Senate but was defeated in the House. Democrats opposed the bill, arguing that mandatory minimum sentences were too harsh, and successfully removed them during the amendment process. Republicans criticized the move, accusing Democrats of prioritizing leniency over public safety. Meanwhile, violent crime in Baltimore surged, with Mayor Young urging residents to stop the violence. Despite bipartisan support and strong public backing, the bill's failure left many, including Democrats and Republicans, dissatisfied with the legislative session's outcome. END OF SUMMARY.
