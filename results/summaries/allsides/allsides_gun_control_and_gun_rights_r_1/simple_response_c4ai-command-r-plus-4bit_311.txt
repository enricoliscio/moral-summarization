SUMMARY: In a time of crisis, when hospitals are already overwhelmed and in dire need of resources, the actions of the Maryland Democrats are simply immoral. As Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients, his fellow Democrats in the state legislature rejected a bill that would have strengthened penalties for violent gun-related crimes. Governor Hogan's Violent Firearms Offenders Act aimed to reduce gun violence by increasing penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use guns in drug dealing. Despite the bill's popularity among Baltimore residents and its potential to save lives, the Democrats chose to put their political agenda first, gutting the bill of its mandatory minimum sentencing provisions and ultimately voting it down. Their actions undermine public safety and send a message that they value partisan politics over the well-being of their constituents. This is a blatant disregard for the lives and safety of Maryland citizens, and the Democrats must be held accountable for their immoral and dangerous decision-making.

END OF SUMMARY.
