SUMMARY: Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could treat coronavirus patients, but on the same day, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence. The bill, supported by Republican governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for illegal gun use. Despite the removal of mandatory minimum sentencing to gain Democratic support, the bill was ultimately voted down by the Democratic-controlled House, with Speaker Adrienne Jones offering no comment. The rejection came as violent crime spiked in Baltimore, with Mayor Young pleading for an end to the violence to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients. The bill was popular among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide, but Democratic amendments had weakened it, removing penalty enhancements for various gun-related crimes. Following the vote, the legislature adjourned due to the coronavirus crisis, with some lawmakers expressing disappointment at the failure to address crime in the state. 

END OF SUMMARY.
