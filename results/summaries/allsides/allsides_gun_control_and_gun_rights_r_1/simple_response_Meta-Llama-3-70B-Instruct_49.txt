SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of hypocrisy, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, while Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The rejected bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. Democrats claimed the bill was too harsh, but their actions speak louder than words. As the city's violent crime rate surges, Democrats prioritized leniency for criminals over public safety. Meanwhile, Mayor Young pleaded with residents to stop the senseless violence, highlighting the need for hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The irony is palpable: Democrats want to protect criminals, but not innocent lives. The people of Baltimore deserve better.

END OF SUMMARY.
