SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of hypocrisy, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals can focus on treating coronavirus patients. The rejected bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. Instead, Democrats prioritized leniency, removing mandatory minimum sentencing increases and weakening the legislation. This move is particularly egregious given the overwhelming support for the bill among Baltimore residents (85%) and African Americans statewide (84%). Meanwhile, violent crime continues to spike in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night alone. The mayor's words ring hollow as his party blocks meaningful action to address the city's gun violence epidemic. By prioritizing the interests of violent criminals over public safety, Maryland Democrats have failed their constituents and undermined the rule of law.

END OF SUMMARY.
