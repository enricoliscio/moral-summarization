SUMMARY:

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other, so hospitals could focus on treating coronavirus patients. The rejected bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for repeat offenders. Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentencing, arguing it would punish violent criminals too severely. Meanwhile, violent crime spiked in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night, prompting Young to urge residents to stop the senseless violence, which could "clog up our hospitals" needed for coronavirus patients. Republicans accused Democrats of undermining public safety by gutting the legislation. The bill was overwhelmingly popular among Baltimore residents, with 85% supporting it. The failure to pass the bill was seen as a disappointment, leaving the issue of crime in the state unaddressed.
