SUMMARY: As Baltimore mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals could treat coronavirus patients, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence. The bill, proposed by Republican governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making the theft of a firearm a felony and increasing penalties for those who repeatedly carry illegal guns or use a gun while drug dealing. Despite the removal of mandatory minimum sentencing increases, which Democrats argued would be too severe, the bill was still voted down by the Democratic-controlled House. This rejection was despite the bill's popularity among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide and the city's recent spike in violent crime. Baltimore police commissioner Michael Harrison and mayor Young both expressed their dismay at the unacceptable level of violence, with Young pleading with residents to stop shooting each other and clogging up hospitals needed for coronavirus patients. The Maryland legislature adjourned without passing the bill, with Democratic state senator Will Smith Jr. expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of action on crime.
END OF SUMMARY.
