Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand what's happening.

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence. Meanwhile, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young is urging residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals can focus on COVID-19 patients. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would increase penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony. The state Senate passed it after removing mandatory minimums, which Democrats argued were too harsh. Some Democrats, like Will Smith Jr., felt the session didn't do enough, while Republicans accused Democrats of weakening the bill. Public support was high for the bill, especially in Baltimore and among African Americans. Violent crime has spiked, and the mayor emphasized the need to reduce gun violence to free up hospital resources for COVID-19.

I need to capture the moral aspects: the Democrats' stance on penalties, the public's support, the spike in crime, and the mayor's plea. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the conflict between the parties and the moral implications of their actions.

Let me structure this: start with the rejection of the bill, mention the mayor's plea, explain the bill's provisions, the Democrats' amendments, the public support, and the consequences of the rejection. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

I should avoid getting bogged down in too many details. Focus on the key points: rejection, the bill's aims, the amendments, public opinion, and the impact on crime and healthcare.

Make sure to include the moral framing, like the Democrats' concern for not over-punishing vs. the need to address crime and public safety. Also, the mayor's point about hospitals being overwhelmed.

I think that's a good outline. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan aimed at combating gun violence, despite high public support. The bill, which would have increased penalties for violent criminals, was amended to remove mandatory minimum sentences, a move Democrats argued was necessary to avoid overly harsh punishments. Meanwhile, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young pleaded with residents to reduce gun violence to free up hospital resources for COVID-19 patients. Republicans criticized Democrats for weakening the bill, arguing it undermined public safety. Despite the amendments, the bill failed in the legislature, with some lawmakers expressing disappointment over the lack of progress on addressing crime. The rejection highlights a moral conflict between punitive measures and concerns for justice, while the spike in violence underscores the urgent need for solutions to protect public health and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
