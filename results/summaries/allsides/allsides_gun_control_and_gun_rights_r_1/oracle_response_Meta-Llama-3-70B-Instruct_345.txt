SUMMARY:

Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's public plea to residents to stop shooting each other, so hospitals could focus on treating coronavirus patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for repeated illegal gun carrying and drug dealing. Democrats removed the mandatory minimum sentencing increase, arguing it would punish violent criminals too severely. The bill's rejection has sparked disappointment, with critics accusing Democrats of undermining public safety and giving a break to criminals who use firearms to sell drugs. Meanwhile, violent crime has spiked in Baltimore, with seven people shot on Tuesday night, prompting Young to urge residents to stop the senseless violence, which is clogging up hospitals and beds needed for coronavirus patients.
