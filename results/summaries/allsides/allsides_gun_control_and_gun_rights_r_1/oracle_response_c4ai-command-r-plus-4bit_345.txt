SUMMARY: A bill aimed at combating gun violence in Maryland was rejected by Democrats, despite Baltimore Mayor Jack Young's pleas for residents to stop shooting each other to preserve hospital resources for coronavirus patients. Governor Larry Hogan's Violent Firearms Offenders Act, which would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, was voted down by Democrats in the state legislature. The bill aimed to make gun theft a felony and increase penalties for illegal gun possession and use during drug dealing. While the bill initially passed the state Senate with amendments removing mandatory minimum sentencing, it was ultimately rejected by the House, with Speaker Adrienne Jones failing to provide a response. The rejection of the bill came as violent crime spiked in Baltimore, with Mayor Young expressing concern over the city's unacceptable level of violence and the need to preserve hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The bill was supported by a majority of Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide, yet Democratic lawmakers undermined public safety by offering amendments that weakened the bill and gave a break to criminals who use guns to sell drugs. 

END OF SUMMARY.
