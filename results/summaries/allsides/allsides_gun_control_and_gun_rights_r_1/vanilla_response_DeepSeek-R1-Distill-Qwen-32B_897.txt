Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant. They provided a detailed news article and specific instructions on how to format the summary. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence, while the Baltimore mayor is urging residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The bill, proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, included stricter penalties for violent criminals, but Democrats removed mandatory minimums, leading to its rejection.

Next, I should identify the key points: the rejection of the bill, the mayor's plea, the bill's provisions, the Democrats' amendments, the public support for the bill, and the implications of the rejection.

Now, considering the user's requirements, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should ensure it captures all main points without getting too detailed.

I should structure the summary to first mention the rejection of the bill, then the mayor's plea, followed by the bill's details, the amendments by Democrats, the public support, and the disappointment from Republicans. I need to keep each point brief to stay within the word limit.

I also need to make sure the summary is clear and flows logically, connecting the political actions with the public health context. Avoiding any markdown, just plain text with the specified tokens.

Finally, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within 200 words, and check that all key elements are included without unnecessary details.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan aimed at combating gun violence, despite strong public support. The bill, the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, sought to strengthen penalties for violent criminals, including those who steal firearms or use guns in drug dealing. Democrats amended the bill to remove mandatory minimum sentences, arguing against overly harsh penalties, leading to its defeat. Meanwhile, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young pleaded with residents to reduce violence, as hospitals were stretched thin by the coronavirus pandemic. GOP lawmakers criticized Democrats for gutting the bill, claiming it undermined public safety. The bill had broad support among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide, but its rejection left many, including House Minority Leader Nic Kipke, disappointed, as crime rates continued to rise. END OF SUMMARY.
