Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at combating gun violence. At the same time, Baltimore's mayor is pleading with residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals can focus on COVID-19 patients. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would increase penalties for violent criminals. It passed the Senate but was rejected by the House because Democrats removed mandatory minimums. The Democrats argued it was too harsh, while Republicans accused them of undermining public safety.

I need to make sure the summary includes the morally charged words like "violence," "shooting," "treat," etc. I should focus on the conflict between the Democrats and Republicans, the rejection of the bill, and the public reaction. Also, the connection between the violence and the strain on hospitals during the pandemic is important.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key actions and the moral implications. Maybe start with the Democrats rejecting the bill, then mention the mayor's plea. Include the details about the bill's provisions and the amendments. Conclude with the public support and the ongoing issue of crime.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. I'll avoid any technical jargon and keep the language clear. Also, ensure that all the morally framed words are included where appropriate without forcing them in.

Let me draft the summary step by step, ensuring each part is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: Maryland Democrats rejected a bill proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan aimed at combating gun violence, despite widespread public support. The bill, the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, sought to strengthen penalties for violent criminals, including those who steal firearms or use them in drug dealing. However, Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentencing increases, arguing the penalties were too severe. The bill passed the state Senate but was ultimately rejected by the House. Meanwhile, Baltimore Mayor Jack Young pleaded with residents to stop shooting each other, as hospitals needed to focus on treating coronavirus patients. The rejection of the bill was seen as a disappointment by Republicans, who accused Democrats of undermining public safety. Despite the legislative failure, 85% of Baltimore residents and 84% of African Americans statewide supported the bill. Violent crime has surged in Baltimore, with seven people shot in a single night, prompting calls for action to address the issue. END OF SUMMARY.
