Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about Maryland Democrats rejecting a bill aimed at reducing gun violence. At the same time, Baltimore's mayor, Jack Young, is asking residents to stop shooting each other so hospitals can focus on COVID-19 patients. The bill, called the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, was proposed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan. It aimed to increase penalties for violent criminals, like making firearm theft a felony and increasing penalties for illegal gun use.

The bill passed the state Senate after some changes. Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentences, arguing it was too harsh. State Senate President Bill Ferguson praised the bipartisan effort. However, the House didn't pass it, adjourning due to the pandemic. The failure to pass the bill was seen as a disappointment by some lawmakers, especially regarding public safety.

There's also mention of a poll showing high support for the bill among Baltimore residents and African Americans. Meanwhile, violent crime in Baltimore has spiked, leading the mayor to plea for an end to violence to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients.

So, the key points are: Democrats rejected the bill, despite public support; the bill aimed to strengthen penalties; the rejection happened as the city faced increased gun violence and a pandemic. I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words.

I'll start by mentioning the rejection of the bill, the context of the mayor's plea, the bill's provisions, the legislative process, the reaction from both parties, the public support, and the current spike in crime and its impact on healthcare.

Let me structure it step by step, ensuring it's concise and covers all main points without going over the word limit.
