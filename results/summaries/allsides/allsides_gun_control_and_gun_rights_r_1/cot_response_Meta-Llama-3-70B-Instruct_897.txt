SUMMARY:
As Baltimore faces a surge in violent crime, Mayor Jack Young publicly begged residents to stop shooting each other, pleading with them not to "clog up our hospitals and beds with people [who] are being shot senselessly." However, on the same day, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, which would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals. The bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, had overwhelming support from Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. Democrats removed mandatory minimum sentencing, arguing it would punish violent criminals too severely. The rejection of the bill is seen as a "disappointment" by many, as it fails to address the issue of crime in the state. The mayor's plea comes as hospitals need to focus on treating coronavirus patients, and the city cannot afford to have beds taken up by "people that are being shot senselessly." END OF SUMMARY.
