SUMMARY:

In a shocking display of hypocrisy, Maryland Democrats rejected a bill aimed at combating gun violence, while Baltimore Mayor Jack Young begged residents to stop shooting each other to free up hospital beds for coronavirus patients. The rejected bill, pushed by Republican Governor Larry Hogan, would have strengthened penalties for violent criminals, including making the theft of a firearm a felony. Democrats claimed the bill was too harsh, but their actions are morally reprehensible, especially given the overwhelming support for the bill among Baltimore residents and African Americans statewide. Meanwhile, the city's violent crime rate continues to spike, with seven people shot on Tuesday night alone. The mayor's plea for residents to stop the senseless violence rings hollow when his party blocks efforts to address the root cause of the problem. It's a stark example of political expediency over public safety and moral responsibility.
