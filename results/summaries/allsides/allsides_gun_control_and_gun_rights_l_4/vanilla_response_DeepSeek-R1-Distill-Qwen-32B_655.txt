Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach. The article mentions four steps the US should take, like banning sales to those on no-fly lists and universal background checks. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens. I'll focus on the key points: Australia's success, the four steps, and the argument against assault weapons. I should keep it clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown as instructed.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the U.S. struggle with mass shootings and contrasts it with Australia's successful approach after implementing strict gun laws in 1996, which eliminated mass public shootings for 20 years. The U.S. is unlikely to adopt such dramatic measures, but the author suggests four practical steps to reduce gun violence: banning gun sales to those on the "no-fly" list, requiring universal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring prohibited purchasers are properly identified and added to the list. The article also advocates for a return to a federal assault weapons ban, arguing that such weapons, like the AR-15, are overly lethal and unnecessary for self-defense. The author emphasizes that these measures should not be controversial, except for those profiting from gun sales. END OF SUMMARY.
