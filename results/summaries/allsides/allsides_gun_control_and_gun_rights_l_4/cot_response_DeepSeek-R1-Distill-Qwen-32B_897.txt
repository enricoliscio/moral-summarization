Okay, so I need to help summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I have to identify all the single words that carry moral implications. Let me read through the article again to spot those words.

The article starts by talking about the Orlando shooting and how it's made people wonder if there's a politically feasible path to dealing with mass shootings. So words like "feasible," "problem," "mass shootings" might be moral here. Then it mentions Australia's response with a ban on rapid-fire rifles, which is a moral action. The results were stunning, so "stunning" is a positive moral word.

Next, the author says there's no chance of such action here, implying a moral failing. Then, videos urging extremists to exploit lax gun laws, so "urging," "extremists," "exploit," "lax" are moral. The steps proposed: prohibiting "no-fly" list individuals from buying guns, which is a moral stance. Background checks are a moral issue because they prevent bad actors. The author mentions that these shouldn't be separate issues, so "separate" is a moral framing word.

Strengthening background checks, ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included, and giving the FBI time to evaluate. "Strengthening," "prohibited," "evaluate" are moral. The example of Charleston shows the importance, so "killing," "prohibited" again. The police and public must take initiative, so "initiative" is moral. Orlando shooter's history of abuse, so "violent," "abuse," "misconduct," "attention," "authorities," "prohibited" again.

The article then talks about the federal assault weapons ban, which is a moral action. Controversial because gun sellers oppose it, so "oppose," "restrictions," "loopholes." Gun sellers need to boost sales, so "stress," "more powerful," "weapons." Assault weapons are as deadly as machine guns, so "deadly," "banned." AR-15 is lethal, so "lethal," "permissible," "civilian use." NRA's stance is criticized, so "credible."

Now, compiling all these words: feasible, problem, mass shootings, banned, stunning, chance, urging, extremists, exploit, lax, prohibited, purchasers, background checks, separate, strengthening, initiative, violent, abuse, misconduct, attention, authorities, federal assault weapons ban, controversial, oppose, restrictions, loopholes, stress, more powerful, deadly, banned, lethal, permissible, civilian use, credible.

Next, I need to write a summary using as many of these words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and highlight the moral framing.

The article discusses the political feasibility of addressing mass shootings in the U.S. after the Orlando tragedy. Australia's effective response via gun bans is contrasted with the U.S.'s inaction. The author suggests four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from purchasing guns, universal background checks, strengthening these checks, and adding prohibited purchasers to a list. The need for a federal assault weapons ban is emphasized, despite opposition from gun sellers. The moral argument is that stricter laws would prevent violence, even if it inconveniences some. The NRA's stance is criticized, and the lethal nature of weapons like the AR-15 is highlighted as a reason for regulation.

I think that captures the moral framing well, using many of the identified words.
