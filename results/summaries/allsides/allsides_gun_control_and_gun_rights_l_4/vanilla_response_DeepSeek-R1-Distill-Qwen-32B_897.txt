Okay, so I need to summarize this article about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach. The user provided the article and an example summary, but I should come up with my own. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It starts by talking about the Orlando shooting and the sit-in by House Democrats, highlighting the issue of mass shootings in the US. It then compares this to Australia, which implemented strict gun laws after their own mass shootings in 1996, leading to no mass shootings in 20 years. 

The article then discusses four steps the US should take: banning gun sales to those on the no-fly list, requiring background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring all prohibited purchasers are added to the list. It also mentions the need for a federal assault weapons ban, despite opposition from gun owners and sellers.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the comparison with Australia, the four steps, and the mention of the assault weapons ban. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear and concise.

Let me structure it: Start with the Orlando shooting and the comparison to Australia. Then outline the four proposed steps briefly. Mention the controversial part about assault weapons. Keep each point short to stay within the word limit.

I should make sure to highlight that the US hasn't taken such drastic measures and that the four steps are non-controversial except for the last one about assault weapons. Also, note that the background checks and no-fly list are connected to prevent loopholes.

I think that's a good outline. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing issue of mass shootings in the U.S., highlighting the political challenges in addressing gun control. Following the Orlando nightclub shooting, House Democrats staged a sit-in, drawing attention to the lack of progress on this issue. In contrast, Australia implemented strict gun laws in 1996, banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening regulations, resulting in no mass shootings in the past 20 years. The U.S. is unlikely to adopt such dramatic measures, but the article proposes four steps to reduce gun violence: banning gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring all prohibited purchasers are identified. Additionally, it suggests reinstating and tightening the federal assault weapons ban, despite opposition from gun owners and sellers. The article argues that modern assault weapons, like the AR-15, are too lethal for civilian use and should be banned. END OF SUMMARY.
