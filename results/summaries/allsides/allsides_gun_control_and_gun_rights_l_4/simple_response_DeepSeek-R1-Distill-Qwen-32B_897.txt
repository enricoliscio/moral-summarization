Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article is about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after mass shootings. The author is clearly pushing for stricter gun laws, so I need to make sure that the summary reflects that stance.

First, I'll read through the article again to get the main points. The author mentions four steps the US should take: banning sales to those on the no-fly list, universal background checks, improving the background check system, and adding prohibited purchasers. They also talk about the need for an assault weapons ban, arguing that such weapons are too lethal for civilian use.

I should structure the summary to highlight these points, emphasizing the moral imperative for action. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. Maybe start with the comparison to Australia, then outline the four steps, and touch on the argument against assault weapons. I should also mention the opposition from gun sellers and the NRA, as that's part of the moral argument against lax laws.

Wait, I should make sure to include the point that the author believes these measures are necessary to prevent future mass shootings, referencing the Orlando shooting. Also, the part about the NRA and gun sellers' interests is important for the moral framingâ€”it shows that opposition isn't just about rights but profit.

I need to avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear. Let me try to draft a concise version, making sure each key point is covered without going over the word limit. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within 200 words.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the urgent need for gun control reforms in the U.S., drawing parallels to Australia's successful approach after mass shootings in 1996, which led to a ban on rapid-fire rifles and a 20-year absence of mass public shootings. The author argues that the U.S. must take four key steps: banning gun sales to those on the "no-fly" list, implementing universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring all prohibited purchasers are added to restricted lists. The author emphasizes that these measures are non-controversial and necessary to prevent future tragedies, referencing the Orlando shooting and Charleston church massacre. Additionally, the article advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, arguing that such weapons, like the AR-15, are too lethal for civilian use and should be banned. The author criticizes the gun industry for exploiting fear and profit, contrasting this with the moral imperative to protect public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
