SUMMARY:

The recent mass shooting in Orlando has sparked renewed calls for stricter gun control laws in the US. Australia's example, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996, is often cited as a model for success, with no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US can take four steps to reduce the risk of mass shootings: prohibit individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, require federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthen the background check system, and add prohibited purchasers to the rolls. Additionally, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes can help prevent the sale of deadly weapons. The gun industry's opposition to stricter laws is driven by a desire to increase sales, as the market for self-protection guns has become saturated. By prioritizing public safety over gun sales, the US can reduce the risk of mass shootings and protect its citizens.
