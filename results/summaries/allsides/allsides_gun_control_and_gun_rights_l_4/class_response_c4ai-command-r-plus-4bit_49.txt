SUMMARY: As House Democrats staged a sit-in following the recent nightclub shooting in Orlando, the question arises: what can be done to deal with mass shootings in America? While countries like Australia have successfully banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations, resulting in no mass shootings for 20 years, such dramatic action seems unlikely in the US. However, there are four reasonable steps that can be taken to diminish the risk of further mayhem. Firstly, those on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Secondly, federal law should mandate background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from bypassing the system. Thirdly, the background check system must be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and that the FBI has sufficient time to evaluate each case. Lastly, the public must take the initiative to report violent behavior so that individuals like the Orlando shooter, who was a suspected wife abuser, are added to the prohibited purchaser list. In addition to these measures, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is necessary, despite opposition from gun enthusiasts. Gun sellers object to tighter laws because they profit from creating a perceived need for more powerful and faster-shooting weapons. Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that exceed a certain level of deadliness should be banned, as they enable rapid fire of damaging bullets. The Second Amendment does not justify the possession of such protection weapons.
END OF SUMMARY.
