Okay, so I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the issue of mass shootings in the US and compares it to Australia's approach. Australia had a series of mass shootings and then banned rapid-fire rifles in 1996, which led to no mass shootings in 20 years. The US, on the other hand, hasn't taken such drastic measures. 

The author suggests four steps the US should take. The first is prohibiting anyone on the no-fly list from buying guns. Second, requiring background checks for all gun sales, not just some. They argue that these two should go together because otherwise, people could bypass the checks. Third, improving the background check system so it includes all prohibited buyers and gives the FBI enough time to evaluate. Fourth, making sure police and the public report prohibited purchasers to authorities.

Additionally, the author mentions a return to a federal assault weapons ban, though this is more controversial. They argue that assault weapons are too deadly and shouldn't be allowed for civilian use. They also reference the NRA's stance and the idea that most self-defense cases don't require assault weapons.

So, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the comparison with Australia, the four steps, and the mention of the assault weapons ban. I need to make sure it's concise and covers all the main points without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with the context of the Orlando shooting, mention Australia's response, then outline the four steps, and finally touch on the assault weapons ban and its controversy. Make sure to keep it under 200 words.
