SUMMARY: In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is again left wondering how to deal with its mass shooting problem. Australia's ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulation in 1996 has resulted in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem. Firstly, those on the "no-fly" list should be prohibited purchasers. Secondly, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales. Thirdly, the background check system needs to be strengthened to include all prohibited purchasers and give the FBI sufficient time to evaluate legitimacy. Lastly, the police, prosecutors, and public must ensure that all prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. Additionally, the federal assault weapons ban should be reinstated with tightened loopholes to keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. Gun sellers object to tighter laws as they profit from lax gun laws, which allow them to pump up sales by stressing the need for more powerful weapons. END OF SUMMARY.
