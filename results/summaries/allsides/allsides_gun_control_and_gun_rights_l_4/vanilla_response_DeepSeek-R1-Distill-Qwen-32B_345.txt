Alright, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it first. It's about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after their mass shootings in 1996. Australia banned rapid-fire rifles and hasn't had a mass shooting since. The US, on the other hand, isn't taking such drastic steps. The article suggests four main actions the US should take.

First, people on the no-fly list should be prohibited from buying guns. Second, all gun sales need background checks. Third, the background system needs to be stronger, including all prohibited buyers and giving the FBI enough time to review. Fourth, authorities should add more prohibited buyers to the list, like the Orlando shooter who was a violent abuser.

The article also mentions returning to a federal assault weapons ban, though this is more controversial. Gun sellers might oppose it because they rely on selling more powerful weapons to people who already own guns for self-defense. The author argues that assault weapons are too lethal for civilian use, citing the AR-15 as an example.

So, the summary needs to include these four steps and the mention of the assault weapons ban. It should be concise, under 200 words. I'll structure it to highlight the key points: Australia's example, the four steps, and the debate over assault weapons. Make sure to mention the no-fly list, universal background checks, strengthening the system, and adding prohibited buyers. Also, touch on the controversial part about banning assault weapons and why it's opposed by gun sellers. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the lack of progress in addressing mass shootings in the U.S., contrasting it with Australia's successful response in 1996 through strict gun regulations. The author proposes four steps to reduce gun violence: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from purchasing guns, requiring universal background checks for all sales, strengthening the background check system to include all prohibited purchasers, and ensuring authorities add violent individuals to prohibited lists. Additionally, the article advocates for a federal assault weapons ban, arguing that such weapons, like the AR-15, are too lethal for civilian use. The author highlights the gun industry's reliance on selling high-powered weapons to boost sales, despite declining hunting rates. END OF SUMMARY.
