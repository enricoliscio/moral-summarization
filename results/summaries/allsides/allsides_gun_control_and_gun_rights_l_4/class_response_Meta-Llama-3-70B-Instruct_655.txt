SUMMARY: In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is again faced with the question of how to deal with its mass shooting problem. Australia's example of banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations in 1996 has led to 20 years without a single mass public shooting. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem. Firstly, those on the "no-fly" list should be prohibited purchasers. Secondly, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales. Thirdly, the background check system needs to be strengthened to include all prohibited purchasers and give the FBI sufficient time to evaluate legitimacy. Lastly, the police, prosecutors, and public must ensure that all prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls, including violent individuals like the Orlando shooter. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is necessary to keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. END OF SUMMARY.
