SUMMARY:

In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, House Democrats staged a sit-in, reigniting the debate on gun control. The US can learn from Australia, which suffered a string of mass shootings before taking action in 1996, banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations. The result: no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem. First, prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns. Second, require federal background checks for all gun sales. Third, strengthen the background check system to include all prohibited purchasers and give the FBI time to evaluate legitimacy. Fourth, ensure prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls, including violent abusers. Additionally, consider reinstating the federal assault weapons ban, which was allowed to lapse, and tighten its loopholes. The goal is to keep guns out of the wrong hands and prevent further suffering and mayhem. END OF SUMMARY.
