SUMMARY:
The recent mass shooting in Orlando has sparked a renewed debate on gun control in the US. In contrast to Australia, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 and has not had a mass public shooting in 20 years, the US has been slow to act. It's "well past time" to take steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem. Four steps are proposed: prohibiting suspected terrorists from buying guns, requiring background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and encouraging the reporting of violent individuals. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is suggested, as these weapons are "deadly" and allow for "rapid fire of large numbers of particularly damaging bullets." The gun industry's opposition to tighter laws is driven by a desire to "profit" from gun sales. It's time to prioritize public safety over the interests of gun sellers. END OF SUMMARY.
