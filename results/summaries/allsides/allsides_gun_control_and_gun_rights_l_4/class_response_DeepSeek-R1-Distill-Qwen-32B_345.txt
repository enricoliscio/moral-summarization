Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after their mass shootings. The author suggests four steps: prohibiting certain individuals from buying guns, universal background checks, strengthening the system, and encouraging reporting of prohibited purchasers. They also mention the need for an assault weapons ban, arguing against the gun lobby and the industry's tactics.

I need to capture the moral urgency here. Words like "shooting," "deal," "diminish," "mayhem," "profit," "prohibited," "strengthened," "failed," "turned," "killers," "shooter," "abuser," "misconduct," "tries," "pump," "stress," "deadly," "banned," "exceed," "fire," "revolver" are key. I should weave these into the summary.

I'll start by mentioning the Orlando shooting and the comparison to Australia. Then outline the four steps, emphasizing the moral imperative. I'll also touch on the assault weapons ban and the gun industry's role. Keeping it concise, I'll ensure each point is clear and the moral framing is evident.

Let me draft this, making sure each sentence includes the necessary terms and flows logically. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll format it with the required tokens.

SUMMARY:  
The article addresses the moral imperative to address mass shootings in the U.S., drawing parallels to Australia's successful approach after its own tragedies. Following the Orlando shooting, the author highlights the need for urgent action, emphasizing that America's lax gun laws enable mayhem. The author proposes four steps: prohibiting individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, implementing universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring all prohibited purchasers are reported to authorities. These measures aim to diminish the risk of future tragedies, such as the Charleston church shooting, where a prohibited purchaser obtained weapons. The author also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, arguing that modern weapons, like the AR-15, are too deadly for civilian use and should be banned. The gun industry's tactics, including stressing the need for more powerful weapons, are criticized as profit-driven and irresponsible. The moral framing underscores the failure to act and the need to prioritize public safety over gun lobby interests. END OF SUMMARY.
