SUMMARY: As House Democrats staged a sit-in in Congress following the recent nightclub shooting in Orlando, the public is again left questioning if there is a politically feasible solution to America's problem with mass shootings. While other countries, like Australia, have successfully reduced mass shootings by implementing strict gun control measures, the United States has yet to take similar action. There are four reasonable steps that the US should take immediately to diminish the chances of further mayhem. First, suspected terrorists on the "no-fly" list should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law should require universal background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from circumventing the system through private sales. Third, the background check system must be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and that the FBI has sufficient time to evaluate each case. Finally, the public, police, and prosecutors must work together to add prohibited purchasers, such as violent abusers, to the list. In addition to these measures, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is necessary, along with closing loopholes that allow dangerous weapons and high-capacity magazines to fall into the wrong hands. The gun industry's profit-driven tactics and the NRA's misleading arguments about the Second Amendment should not be allowed to jeopardize public safety any longer. It is time to take action and protect our communities from the scourge of mass shootings.
END OF SUMMARY.
