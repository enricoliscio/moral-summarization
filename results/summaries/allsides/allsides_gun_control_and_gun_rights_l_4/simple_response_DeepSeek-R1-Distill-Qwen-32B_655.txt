Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about gun control in the U.S. after the Orlando shooting, comparing it to Australia's successful approach. The author suggests four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from buying guns, universal background checks, strengthening the background system, and adding prohibited purchasers. They also mention the need for an assault weapons ban, arguing against the NRA's stance. I should highlight the moral urgency and the contrast with Australia. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include all key points without losing the author's perspective.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the urgent need for gun control measures in the U.S. following the Orlando shooting, drawing a moral contrast with Australia's successful approach to preventing mass shootings through stricter gun laws. The author outlines four key steps: prohibiting individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, implementing universal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system to include all prohibited purchasers, and ensuring authorities actively add such individuals to restricted lists. The article also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, arguing that weapons like the AR-15, designed for maximum lethality, should be banned due to their high capacity for destruction. The author criticizes the gun industry for exploiting fear to sell more weapons, emphasizing that self-defense rarely requires such firepower. The moral framing underscores the failure to act on preventing gun violence and the need for common-sense reforms to protect public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
