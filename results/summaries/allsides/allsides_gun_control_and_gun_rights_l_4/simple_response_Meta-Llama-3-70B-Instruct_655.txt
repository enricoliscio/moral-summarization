SUMMARY: 

The recent mass shooting in Orlando has reignited the debate on gun control in the US. In contrast, Australia's ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 has resulted in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US can take four steps to reduce the risk of mass shootings: prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, require federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthen the background check system, and ensure prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. Additionally, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes can prevent the sale of deadly weapons. The gun industry's opposition to tighter laws stems from its need to boost sales, as hunting has declined and guns last for decades. It's morally imperative to prioritize public safety over gun sellers' profits and restrict access to deadly weapons.
