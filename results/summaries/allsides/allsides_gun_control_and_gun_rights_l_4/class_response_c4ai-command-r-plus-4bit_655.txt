SUMMARY: In the wake of the recent shooting in Orlando, there is renewed attention on the issue of mass shootings in America and what steps can be taken to diminish the chances of future mayhem. While dramatic actions such as Australia's complete ban on rapid-fire rifles may not be politically feasible in the US, there are four reasonable and necessary steps that can be taken. First, those on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from skipping the screening process by purchasing through private sales. Third, the background check system must be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and that the FBI has sufficient time to evaluate each case. Fourth, the public must take the initiative to report violent behavior, such as domestic abuse, so that these individuals can be added to the prohibited purchaser list. In addition to these measures, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is necessary, despite controversy over restricting access to these weapons for self-defense. The argument that assault weapons are "protection weapons" permitted by the Second Amendment is not credible, as modern assault weapons are extremely deadly and exceed what is reasonable for civilian use. 
END OF SUMMARY.
