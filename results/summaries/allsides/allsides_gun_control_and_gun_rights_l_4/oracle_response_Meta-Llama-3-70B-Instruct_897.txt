SUMMARY: In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is again left wondering if there's a feasible path to dealing with the country's mass shooting problem. Australia suffered a string of mass shootings before taking action in 1996, banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, require federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthen the background check system, and add prohibited purchasers to the rolls. Additionally, the federal assault weapons ban should be reinstated with tightened loopholes. Gun sellers object to tighter laws as they need to find ways to get people to buy more weapons, stressing the need for more powerful, faster-shooting weapons. It's time to take action and ban deadly weapons that allow for rapid fire of damaging bullets. END OF SUMMARY.
