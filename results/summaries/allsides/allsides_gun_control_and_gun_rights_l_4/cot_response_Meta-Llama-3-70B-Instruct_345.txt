SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is again grappling with its problem of mass shootings. Unlike Australia, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 and has not had a mass public shooting in 20 years, the US seems unwilling to take dramatic action. However, there are four steps that can be taken to diminish the chances of more mayhem. These include prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, requiring federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and encouraging the public to report misconduct to add individuals to the prohibited purchaser list. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is necessary to keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. It's time to take action to prevent more senseless violence. END OF SUMMARY.
