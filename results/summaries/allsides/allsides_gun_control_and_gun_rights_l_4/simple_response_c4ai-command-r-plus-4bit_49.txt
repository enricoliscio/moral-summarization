SUMMARY: As the US grapples with the issue of mass shootings, it's worth noting Australia's success in curbing such tragedies by banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations. While dramatic action on gun control may not be feasible in the US, there are four reasonable steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies. First, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law should mandate background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from circumventing the system through private sales. Third, the background check system should be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and the FBI has sufficient time to conduct thorough investigations. Finally, the public must take an active role in reporting domestic abusers and other prohibited individuals to the authorities to ensure they are added to the prohibited purchaser list. In addition to these measures, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is warranted, despite opposition from gun enthusiasts. The deadly nature of modern assault weapons and high-capacity magazines exceeds what is permissible for civilian use, and the Second Amendment does not justify their possession as "protection weapons." These steps are crucial in addressing the moral imperative to protect innocent lives and prevent further gun-related tragedies in the United States.
END OF SUMMARY.
