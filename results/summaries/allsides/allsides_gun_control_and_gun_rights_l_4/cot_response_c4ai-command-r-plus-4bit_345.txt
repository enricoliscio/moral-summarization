SUMMARY:
The recent mass shooting in Orlando has once again brought to light the issue of gun control in America. While other countries like Australia have taken successful steps to eradicate mass shootings by implementing strict gun control laws, the United States continues to struggle with finding a feasible solution. There are four morally imperative steps that the US should take immediately to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies. Firstly, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing firearms. Secondly, federal law should mandate background checks for all gun sales, ensuring that terrorists cannot exploit loopholes by purchasing guns through private sales. Thirdly, the background check system needs strengthening by including all prohibited purchasers and allowing sufficient time for FBI investigations. Finally, the public must take an active role in reporting instances of misconduct so that prohibited purchasers can be added to the list. In addition to these measures, there is a pressing need to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban and address its existing loopholes. While some may argue that assault weapons are protected by the Second Amendment, the fact remains that these weapons are unnecessarily deadly and have no place in civilian hands. The time for action is now; we cannot allow the profit motives of gun sellers to take precedence over the safety and well-being of our citizens.
