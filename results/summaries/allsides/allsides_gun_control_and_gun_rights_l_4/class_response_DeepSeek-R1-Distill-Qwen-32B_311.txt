Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points. The article talks about the issue of mass shootings in the US, compares it to Australia's response, and suggests four steps to address gun control. The author uses words like "shooting," "dealings," "diminish," "mayhem," etc., which are morally charged. I should make sure to include these words in the summary.

First, the article mentions the Orlando shooting and the lack of political will for gun control. Australia's example is given as a success after they banned rapid-fire rifles. The author then outlines four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from buying guns, universal background checks, strengthening the background system, and adding prohibited purchasers. Also, the article suggests reintroducing an assault weapons ban.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the Orlando shooting and the comparison to Australia. Then list the four steps, using the morally framed words. I should also touch on the opposition from gun sellers and the reasoning behind banning assault weapons. Finally, I'll conclude with the call for action, emphasizing the moral imperative.

Let me structure this: introduce the problem, mention Australia's solution, outline the four steps, discuss opposition, and conclude with the need for action. I'll ensure that words like "shooting," "prohibited," "killing," etc., are included. I'll keep each point concise to stay within the word limit. 

Wait, I should also mention the NRA and the argument about self-defense, as that's part of the moral framing. Including that assault weapons are not necessary for defense adds to the moral argument. I'll make sure to include that point. 

I think that's all. Time to put it together in a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: The article addresses the moral imperative to address mass shootings in the U.S., highlighting the Orlando nightclub shooting and the lack of politically feasible solutions. It contrasts this with Australia's response to similar tragedies, which included banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun laws, leading to 20 years without mass public shootings. The author proposes four steps to diminish gun violence: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from purchasing guns, implementing universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring all prohibited purchasers are added to a list. The article also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, emphasizing the deadly nature of modern weapons like the AR-15 and arguing that such weapons exceed the bounds of permissible civilian use. The author criticizes the gun industry for profiting from the sale of powerful weapons and questions the notion that assault weapons are necessary for self-defense. The moral framing underscores the need to prevent killers and abusers from accessing firearms, while also addressing the systemic failures in background checks and the ethical responsibility to act. END OF SUMMARY.
