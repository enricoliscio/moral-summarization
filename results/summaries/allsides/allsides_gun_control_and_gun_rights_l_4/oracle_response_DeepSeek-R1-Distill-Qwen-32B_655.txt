Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. The article is about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after mass shootings. It mentions four steps the US should take: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from buying guns, requiring background checks for all sales, strengthening the background system, and improving the process for adding prohibited purchasers. It also talks about banning assault weapons, which is controversial because some people oppose it, but the author argues it's necessary to prevent mass shootings.

Now, the user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. The list includes words like shooting, ban, tightening, urging, etc. I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate without making the summary too long.

I should start by highlighting the comparison with Australia and their successful approach. Then outline the four steps clearly, using the moral terms. Mention the need for background checks and the flaws in the current system. Also, touch on the controversial part about banning assault weapons and the industry's role in promoting sales. Finally, conclude by emphasizing the need for action to prevent future tragedies.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the context, then the four steps, the need for checks, the industry's push, and the conclusion. Make sure to include the moral words like 'ban', 'tightening', 'urging','mayhem', 'killing', 'abuser', etc. I'll avoid any markdown and just write the summary in plain text.

SUMMARY:  
The article discusses the moral imperative to address the U.S. problem with mass shootings, drawing parallels to Australia's successful response through a ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations. The author argues that while dramatic action like Australia's is unlikely in the U.S., four key steps should be taken to reduce gun violence. First, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist leanings or activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales, as omitting this would render the first measure ineffective. Third, the background check system must be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and giving the FBI adequate time to evaluate purchases. Fourth, authorities must actively add prohibited purchasers to the list, including individuals like the Orlando shooter, who is alleged to have been a violent abuser. The article also calls for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, emphasizing that such weapons, like the AR-15, are too deadly for civilian use and should be banned to prevent mayhem. The author highlights the moral responsibility to act, as inaction risks allowing killers to obtain weapons, as seen in the Charleston church shooting. END OF SUMMARY.
