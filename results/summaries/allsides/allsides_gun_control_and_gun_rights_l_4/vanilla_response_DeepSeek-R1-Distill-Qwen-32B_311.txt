Okay, I need to summarize this article about gun control in the U.S. The user provided the article and wants a concise summary. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning the Orlando shooting and the sit-in by House Democrats. It compares the U.S. situation to Australia's approach after their mass shootings in 1996, which led to strict gun laws and no mass shootings since. The author notes that such dramatic action isn't likely in the U.S. but suggests four steps.

The four steps are:
1. Ban gun sales to those on the no-fly list.
2. Require background checks for all gun sales.
3. Strengthen the background check system to include all prohibited purchasers and give the FBI more time.
4. Ensure police and public report prohibited purchasers.

Additionally, the article discusses the need for a federal assault weapons ban, pointing out that gun sellers might oppose it because they rely on selling more weapons, especially assault ones. It argues that these weapons are too lethal for civilian use.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the Orlando shooting and the comparison to Australia. Then outline the four steps clearly. Finally, touch on the assault weapons ban and the industry's role.

I should ensure the summary is clear, concise, and captures all key points without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the problem, the proposed solutions, and the additional measure on assault weapons.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing issue of mass shootings in the U.S. and compares it to Australia's response in 1996, which implemented strict gun laws and has since seen no mass public shootings. While dramatic action is unlikely in the U.S., the author proposes four steps to reduce gun violence: banning gun sales to those on the "no-fly" list, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring prohibited purchasers are reported. Additionally, the article advocates for a federal assault weapons ban, arguing that such weapons are too lethal for civilian use and that the gun industry profits by promoting more powerful firearms. The author emphasizes the need for common-sense measures to prevent future tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
