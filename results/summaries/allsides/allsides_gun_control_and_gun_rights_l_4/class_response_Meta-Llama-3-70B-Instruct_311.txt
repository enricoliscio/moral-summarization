SUMMARY:

In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is again faced with the question of how to deal with its mass shooting problem. Australia's complete ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 have led to 20 years without a single mass public shooting. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem. First, those on the "no-fly" list should be prohibited purchasers. Second, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales. Third, the background check system needs to be strengthened to include all prohibited purchasers and give the FBI sufficient time to evaluate legitimacy. Fourth, the public must take initiative to ensure prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is necessary to keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. Gun sellers' objections to tighter laws stem from their need to profit from sales, but the public's safety must come first. END OF SUMMARY.
