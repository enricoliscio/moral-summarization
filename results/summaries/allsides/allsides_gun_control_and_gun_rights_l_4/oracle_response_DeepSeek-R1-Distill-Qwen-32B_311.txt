Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has already provided an example, but I should make sure I understand the task correctly. The article discusses gun control measures in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after their mass shootings. The author suggests four steps to reduce mass shootings, emphasizing the moral responsibility and urgency.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the key points. The main points are the comparison with Australia, the four proposed steps, and the argument against assault weapons. The morally framed words are important, so I need to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

I should start by highlighting the context of the Orlando shooting and the lack of political will in the US. Then, mention Australia's effective ban and the US's inaction. Next, outline the four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from buying guns, universal background checks, strengthening the system, and adding prohibited purchasers. Also, touch on the need for an assault weapons ban.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll ensure that words like "ban," "shooting," "suffered," and "mayhem" are included to maintain the moral tone. I'll avoid technical jargon and focus on the moral imperative to act against gun violence.

Let me structure this: introduce the issue with the Orlando shooting, compare to Australia, list the four steps succinctly, mention the assault weapons argument, and conclude with the urgency to prevent future tragedies. I'll make sure each point flows logically and includes the necessary moral language.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping an eye on the word count and ensuring all key points are covered with the appropriate moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
The article addresses the urgent need for gun control measures in the U.S., following the Orlando shooting, where 49 were killed. It contrasts this with Australia, which, after suffering mass shootings, implemented a ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun laws, resulting in no mass shootings for 20 years. The author argues that while dramatic action is unlikely in the U.S., four steps should be taken to reduce gun violence: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from purchasing guns, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring all prohibited purchasers are added to the list. The author emphasizes the moral imperative to act, highlighting how lax laws enable mayhem and urging tighter restrictions on assault weapons, which are as deadly as historical machine guns. The article concludes that such measures are necessary to prevent future tragedies and protect public safety.  
END OF SUMMARY.
