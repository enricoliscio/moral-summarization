Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the author's stance.

The article starts by mentioning the Orlando shooting and the Democrats' sit-in, highlighting the political stalemate on gun control. It contrasts this with Australia's actions post-1996, where they banned rapid-fire rifles and haven't had a mass shooting since. The author notes that such drastic measures aren't feasible in the US but emphasizes the need for action, especially with extremists exploiting lax gun laws.

The article then outlines four steps the US should take. The first is banning gun sales to those on the no-fly list. The second is requiring background checks for all gun sales, which the author argues shouldn't be separate issues. Third, strengthening background checks by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and giving the FBI more time to evaluate. Fourth, ensuring police and the public report prohibited purchasers to authorities.

Additionally, the author suggests reinstating and tightening the federal assault weapons ban, pointing out that the gun industry promotes more powerful weapons to boost sales. They argue that assault weapons are too lethal for civilian use and shouldn't be permitted under the Second Amendment.

The moral framing here is strong. The author is clearly advocating for stricter gun laws, emphasizing public safety and preventing future tragedies. They present the issue as a matter of common sense and necessity, not just a political debate. The comparison with Australia reinforces the idea that effective measures are possible. The steps proposed are framed as non-controversial, except for the assault weapons ban, which the author justifies by arguing that such weapons aren't necessary for self-defense and are too dangerous.

I need to make sure the summary captures all these points succinctly, highlighting the moral imperative and the practical steps. I should avoid getting bogged down in the details of each step but ensure each is mentioned. Also, the comparison to Australia and the critique of the gun industry's role are important moral points to include.

Let me structure the summary: start with the context of Orlando and the political impasse. Mention Australia's success. Then outline the four steps briefly, emphasizing their necessity. Conclude with the call for an assault weapons ban, tying it back to public safety and the moral obligation to act.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. Each sentence should convey a key point without unnecessary details. Also, the tone should reflect the author's urgency and conviction about the need for these measures.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it flows logically and maintains the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the U.S. gun control debate in the wake of the Orlando shooting, highlighting the political stalemate and contrasting it with Australia's successful approach after its 1996 mass shootings, which led to a ban on rapid-fire rifles and no mass shootings since. The author argues that while dramatic action like Australia's is unlikely in the U.S., four key steps should be taken to reduce gun violence: banning gun sales to those on the no-fly list, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring prohibited purchasers are reported. Additionally, the author advocates for reinstating and tightening the federal assault weapons ban, emphasizing that such weapons are too lethal for civilian use and questioning their necessity for self-defense. The moral framing underscores the urgent need for common-sense measures to prevent future tragedies, despite political and industry opposition. END OF SUMMARY.
