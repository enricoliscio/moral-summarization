SUMMARY: As the House Democrats staged a sit-in to address America's problem with mass shootings, it is clear that drastic action is needed to diminish the chances of further mayhem. While America is not the only country to experience mass shootings, Australia's successful ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations offer a promising model. Four crucial steps are proposed that should be reasonably acceptable to all but those profiting from gun sales. Firstly, suspected terrorists on the no-fly list should be prohibited purchasers. Secondly, federal law must mandate background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from skipping screening. Thirdly, the background check system must be strengthened to include all prohibited purchasers and allow sufficient time for evaluation. Finally, the public must take the initiative to add prohibited purchasers, such as violent abusers, to the list. In addition, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is necessary, despite controversy over the Second Amendment. The nature of the gun market encourages sellers to pump up sales by stressing the need for more powerful weapons, which is unacceptable. The lethality of modern assault weapons, such as the AR-15, far exceeds the permissible line for civilian use, and the need for self-defense does not justify their ownership. The time has come to prioritize public safety over profit and take decisive action to address this deadly issue.
END OF SUMMARY.
