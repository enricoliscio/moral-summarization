Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, then write a concise summary using those terms. 

Looking at the article, it's about gun control measures in the US, inspired by Australia's approach after their mass shootings. The author is clearly advocating for stricter gun laws, so the moral framing would involve words that convey urgency, necessity, and the consequences of inaction.

First, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral charge. Words like "prohibited," "lax," "ban," "tightening," "stunning," "voluntary," "ineffectual," "controversial," "oppose," "stress," "credible." These words are used to argue for stricter laws and against the current system.

Now, for the summary. I need to keep it under 200 words, include the key points: Australia's success, the four steps proposed, the need for background checks, and the debate over assault weapons. I should use the morally framed words to maintain the author's stance.

I'll start by mentioning the context of the Orlando shooting and the comparison with Australia. Then outline the four steps, emphasizing the necessity and the flaws in the current system. Finally, address the controversial part about assault weapons, using the provided moral terms to stress the need for action.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all main points without being too technical. Also, I should make sure to include the moral framing words to reflect the author's perspective accurately.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses the urgent need for gun control measures in the U.S., drawing parallels with Australia's successful response to mass shootings in 1996. It highlights the moral imperative to address the country's lax gun laws, which have enabled tragedies like the Orlando shooting. The author proposes four steps: prohibiting "no-fly" list individuals from purchasing guns, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring all prohibited purchasers are tracked. The article emphasizes that these measures are necessary to prevent future violence, such as the Charleston church shooting. It also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, arguing that modern weapons like the AR-15 are too deadly for civilian use and should be banned. The author stresses that the Second Amendment does not justify such weapons, as self-defense typically requires only basic firearms. The piece criticizes the gun industry for exploiting fears to sell more weapons, urging policymakers to prioritize public safety over profits. END OF SUMMARY.
