Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after mass shootings. The author suggests four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from buying guns, requiring background checks for all sales, strengthening the background check system, and encouraging reporting of prohibited purchasers. They also mention the need for a federal assault weapons ban.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words from the list. Words like "shooting," "ban," "action," "mayhem," "killing," "prohibited," "checks," etc., are key. I should ensure these are included in the summary.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the Orlando shooting, Australia's response, four proposed steps, and the call for an assault weapons ban. I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the context, then the proposed solutions, and ending with the call for stricter laws. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

Let me draft a summary, ensuring each moral word is appropriately placed. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it concise, focusing on the author's moral stance against gun violence and the need for action.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all key moral terms are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's message. I'll also make sure it's within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral imperative to address mass shootings in the U.S., highlighting Australia's successful response through a ban on rapid-fire rifles. The author argues for four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from purchasing guns, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and encouraging reporting of prohibited purchasers. The author emphasizes the need to prevent mayhem by ensuring that individuals with terrorist leanings or violent activity are kept from acquiring weapons. Additionally, the article calls for a return to a federal assault weapons ban, targeting high-capacity firearms like the AR-15, which are deemed too lethal for civilian use. The moral framing underscores the urgency to protect public safety and reduce gun violence, while addressing the ethical responsibility of policymakers and the public to act decisively. END OF SUMMARY.
