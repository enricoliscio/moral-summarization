SUMMARY: In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is once again forced to confront its problem with mass shootings. Australia, which suffered a string of mass shootings, took action in 1996 by banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem. First, suspected terrorists should be prohibited purchasers. Second, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales. Third, the background check system needs to be strengthened by including all prohibited purchasers and giving the FBI sufficient time to evaluate legitimacy. Fourth, the police, prosecutors, and public must ensure that all prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. Additionally, the federal assault weapons ban should be reinstated with tightened loopholes. The gun industry's profit-driven opposition to tighter laws is morally reprehensible, and it's time to prioritize public safety over gun sales. END OF SUMMARY.
