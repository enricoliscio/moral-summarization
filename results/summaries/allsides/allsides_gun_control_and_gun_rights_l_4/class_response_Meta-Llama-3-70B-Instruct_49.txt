SUMMARY: 

In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is again grappling with its problem of mass shootings. Australia's response to its own mass shootings in 1996, a complete ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulation, has led to 20 years without a single mass public shooting. In contrast, the US has failed to take decisive action. It's well past time to examine steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem. Four steps can be taken immediately: prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, requiring federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and encouraging the public to report prohibited purchasers. Additionally, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes can help keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. The gun industry's profit-driven motives must not be allowed to stand in the way of common-sense reforms that can keep Americans safe from killers and mayhem.

END OF SUMMARY.
