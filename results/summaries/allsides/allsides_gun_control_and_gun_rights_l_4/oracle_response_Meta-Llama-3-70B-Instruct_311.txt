SUMMARY:

The recent mass shooting in Orlando has sparked outrage and calls for action to address America's problem with gun violence. In contrast, Australia took decisive action in 1996, banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US can take four steps to diminish the chances of further mayhem. First, those on the "no-fly" list should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law must require background checks for all gun sales. Third, the background check system needs to be strengthened to include all prohibited purchasers and allow the FBI sufficient time to evaluate legitimacy. Fourth, the public and authorities must ensure that all prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban, with tightened loopholes, is necessary to keep deadly weapons out of the wrong hands. By taking these steps, the US can reduce the suffering and mayhem caused by gun violence. END OF SUMMARY.
