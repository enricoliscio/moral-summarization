SUMMARY:

The article discusses the need for stricter gun control laws in the US in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting. It cites Australia's ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996, which has resulted in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The article proposes four steps to reduce the chances of mass shootings: 1) prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, 2) require federal background checks for all gun sales, 3) strengthen the background check system, and 4) encourage the public to report prohibited purchasers. Additionally, it suggests reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes. The article argues that the gun industry's opposition to stricter laws stems from its need to boost sales, and that assault weapons are not necessary for self-defense.
