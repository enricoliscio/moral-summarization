SUMMARY:
In the wake of recent mass shootings, there is a moral imperative to address America's gun violence problem. While dramatic actions like Australia's successful ban on rapid-fire rifles are unlikely here, there are four reasonable steps we should take immediately. First, suspected terrorists and extremists must be prohibited from purchasing guns, and universal background checks should be mandatory for all gun sales to prevent them from skipping voluntary checks. Second, strengthen the background check system by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and the FBI has sufficient time to evaluate each case. Third, improve the process by which prohibited purchasers are added to the list, especially violent abusers and extremists. Fourth, return to the federal assault weapons ban, tightening loopholes, and restricting weapons and high-capacity magazines that exceed acceptable thresholds of deadliness. The gun industry's marketing of more powerful and faster-shooting weapons for self-protection is questionable, as credible defensive use rarely requires more than a revolver. It's time to prioritize public safety and take moral action to reduce gun violence in America.
