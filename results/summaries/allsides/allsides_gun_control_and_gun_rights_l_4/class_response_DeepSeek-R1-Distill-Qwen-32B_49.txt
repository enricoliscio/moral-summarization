Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants the summary to include as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article starts by discussing the Orlando shooting and the lack of political will to address mass shootings in the U.S., comparing it to Australia's successful gun control measures. The author suggests four steps: banning prohibited purchasers, universal background checks, strengthening the system, and proactive measures against abusers. They also argue for an assault weapons ban, countering the NRA's stance.

I need to highlight the moral elements, using words like "shooting," "deal," "diminish," "mayhem," etc. I should structure the summary to cover each of the four steps and the argument against assault weapons, emphasizing the moral imperative to prevent future tragedies.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows logically. I'll start with the context of the Orlando shooting, mention Australia's example, then outline the four steps, and conclude with the argument for banning assault weapons. I'll use the morally framed words to convey the urgency and necessity of these measures.

Let me draft this, ensuring each point is clear and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article addresses the moral imperative to address mass shootings in the U.S., highlighting the political inaction and the need for decisive measures. Following Australia's example, which banned rapid-fire rifles and saw no mass shootings in 20 years, the author proposes four steps to diminish the risk of mayhem. First, anyone on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorism should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, universal background checks for all gun sales must be implemented. Third, the background check system must be strengthened to include all prohibited purchasers and allow adequate time for evaluation. Fourth, authorities must proactively add violent individuals, like the Orlando shooter, to prohibited purchaser lists. The author also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, arguing that weapons like the AR-15, designed for lethality, should be banned. The NRA's opposition is criticized, as gun sellers profit from promoting more powerful weapons. The moral framing underscores the need to prevent killers and abusers from obtaining firearms, emphasizing the urgency to act to save lives. END OF SUMMARY.
