SUMMARY: America is not the only country to have experienced mass shootings. Australia, which suffered a string of mass shootings, took action in 1996 by banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations. As a result, they have not had a mass shooting in 20 years. While dramatic action on gun control may not be feasible in the US, there are four steps that should be taken immediately to reduce the chances of further mayhem. First, suspected terrorists should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law should require background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from skipping voluntary checks. Third, the background check system must be strengthened to ensure all prohibited purchasers are included and that the FBI has enough time to evaluate each purchaser. Fourth, the public must take the initiative to report violent behavior so that prohibited purchasers can be added to the list. In addition to improving the background check system, the US should consider reinstating the federal assault weapons ban and closing loopholes. While gun sellers may object to tighter laws, the nature of the gun market requires them to encourage people to buy more weapons, often by promoting the need for more powerful and faster-shooting weapons. Assault weapons are not necessary for self-defense and should be banned along with high-capacity magazines that exceed a threshold of deadliness. These steps are reasonable and should be supported by anyone who wants to reduce gun violence in America.
