SUMMARY: House Democrats staged a sit-in to demand action on gun control following the Orlando shooting. While America isn't the only country to experience mass shootings, Australia's successful ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations provide a striking contrast, with no mass shootings in 20 years. Four reasonable steps towards reducing gun violence in the US are proposed: prohibiting suspected terrorists from buying guns, mandating background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and allowing adequate time for evaluation, and encouraging reporting of violent behavior to add individuals to the prohibited purchaser list. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is suggested, despite potential opposition from gun enthusiasts. Gun sellers' opposition to tighter laws is explained by the decline in hunting and the industry's need to promote more powerful weapons to increase sales. The AR-15, designed for lethality, is an example of a weapon that should be banned for civilian use. These measures aim to balance the need for self-defense with the urgency to prevent mass shootings.
END OF SUMMARY.
