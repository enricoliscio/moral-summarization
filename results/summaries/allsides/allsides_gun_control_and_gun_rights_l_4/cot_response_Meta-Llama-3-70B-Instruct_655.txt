SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, House Democrats staged a sit-in in Congress, highlighting the need for stricter gun control laws. The US can learn from Australia's example, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. Four steps can be taken to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, requiring federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and encouraging the public to report violent individuals. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is necessary. The gun industry's profit-driven motives are at odds with legitimate concerns for public safety, and it's time to take action to prevent more violent misconduct. END OF SUMMARY.
