SUMMARY: The article discusses the need for stricter gun control laws in the US, citing the example of Australia, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The author proposes four steps to diminish the chances of mass shootings: 1) prohibiting individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, 2) requiring federal background checks for all gun sales, 3) strengthening the background check system to include all prohibited purchasers, and 4) encouraging the public to report prohibited purchasers. The article also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, citing the deadly nature of modern assault weapons. The author argues that stricter gun laws would not infringe on legitimate gun owners' rights, but would help prevent mass shootings. END OF SUMMARY.
