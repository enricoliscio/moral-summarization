SUMMARY: America is not the only country that has experienced mass shootings. Australia, which had a similar problem, took dramatic action in 1996, banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun laws. As a result, they have not had a mass shooting in 20 years. While such drastic measures are unlikely in the US, there are four reasonable steps that could be taken to diminish the risk of further mayhem. Firstly, suspected terrorists should be prohibited from purchasing firearms. Secondly, federal law should require background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from exploiting loopholes. Thirdly, the background check system should be strengthened to ensure all prohibited purchasers are included and that the FBI has sufficient time to evaluate each case. Lastly, the public must take the initiative to report domestic abusers and other prohibited purchasers to the authorities. In addition to these measures, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is necessary, despite controversy over the Second Amendment. The gun market's focus on promoting more powerful and faster-shooting weapons is dangerous and must be addressed. The NRA's claim that brandishing a revolver is sufficient for self-defense in most cases undermines the argument for assault weapons as "protection weapons." These steps are crucial to dealing with the country's problem with mass shootings and preventing further loss of life.
