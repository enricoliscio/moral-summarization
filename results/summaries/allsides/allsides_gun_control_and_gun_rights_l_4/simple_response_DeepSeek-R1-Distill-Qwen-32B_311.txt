Alright, so the user has provided a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They've given a specific news article and instructions on how to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and follow a specific format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

First, I need to understand the content of the article. It's about gun control in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after their mass shootings in 1996. The author suggests four steps the US should take: banning gun sales to those on the no-fly list, universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and adding prohibited purchasers to a list. Additionally, the article discusses the need for an assault weapons ban, arguing against the gun industry's marketing tactics and the impracticality of assault weapons for self-defense.

Now, I need to preserve the moral framing. The article emphasizes the urgency and necessity of these measures, highlighting the failure of current policies and the moral obligation to prevent future tragedies. The tone is critical of the gun lobby and the inefficiency of the current system.

I should structure the summary to include the key points: the comparison with Australia, the four steps, the argument against assault weapons, and the moral imperative. I need to make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all the main points without getting bogged down in details.

I also need to be careful with word count, ensuring it's under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main ideas, then condense them into a coherent summary. I'll make sure to include the moral angle, such as the failure to act leading to preventable deaths and the need for stricter laws to protect public safety.

Finally, I'll format the summary correctly, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll review it to ensure it flows well and accurately reflects the article's message and moral stance.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the urgent need for gun control measures in the U.S. following mass shootings, drawing parallels to Australia's successful approach after its 1996 ban on rapid-fire rifles, which eliminated mass public shootings for 20 years. The author outlines four critical steps: banning gun sales to those on the "no-fly" list, implementing universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring prohibited purchasers are added to a list. The article also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, arguing that such weapons, like the AR-15, are too lethal for civilian use and serve no legitimate self-defense purpose. The author criticizes the gun industry for exploiting fear to sell weapons and emphasizes the moral imperative to act, as inaction perpetuates preventable tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
