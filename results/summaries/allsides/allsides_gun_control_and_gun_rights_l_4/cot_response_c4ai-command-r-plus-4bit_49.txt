SUMMARY:
In the wake of recent mass shootings, there is growing pressure to address gun violence in America. While countries like Australia have successfully curbed mass shootings by implementing strict gun control measures, the United States has yet to find a politically feasible solution. There are four reasonable steps that should be taken immediately to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies. Firstly, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing firearms. Secondly, federal law must mandate background checks for all gun sales, ensuring that terrorists cannot exploit loopholes by purchasing guns through private sales. Thirdly, the background check system needs to be strengthened by including all prohibited purchasers and allowing sufficient time for proper evaluation. Lastly, the public must take an active role in reporting domestic abusers and other prohibited individuals to ensure they are added to the prohibited purchaser list. In addition to these measures, there is a need to reconsider the federal assault weapons ban and close loopholes that allow the sale of deadly weapons to civilians. The argument that assault weapons are necessary for self-defense is not credible, as the majority of defensive gun use involves merely brandishing a weapon. It is time to prioritize public safety over the profits of gun sellers and take meaningful action to prevent further loss of life.
