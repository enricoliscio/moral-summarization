SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, House Democrats staged a sit-in in Congress, highlighting the need for stricter gun control laws. The US can learn from Australia's example, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. Four steps can be taken to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, requiring federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and encouraging the public to report violent individuals. Additionally, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes can help prevent the sale of deadly weapons. It's time to take action and prioritize public safety over gun sellers' profits. END OF SUMMARY.
