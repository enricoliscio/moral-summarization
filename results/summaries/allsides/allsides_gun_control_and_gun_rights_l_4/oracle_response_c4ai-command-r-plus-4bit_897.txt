SUMMARY: As the House Democrats staged a sit-in to address America's problem with mass shootings, it's clear that action is needed to prevent further suffering and mayhem. The article proposes four steps to reduce the chance of future attacks. First, suspected terrorists should be prohibited from purchasing guns, and background checks should be required for all gun sales to ensure they don't skip the screening. Second, background check systems must be strengthened and include all prohibited purchasers, with sufficient time for evaluation. Third, take initiative to add prohibited purchasers to the rolls, especially those with a history of violent misconduct. Fourth, return to the federal assault weapons ban and tighten loopholes to restrict access to deadly weapons and high-capacity magazines. These proposals are reasonable and should be supported by all but those trying to profit from gun sales. It's time to prioritize public safety and take action against gun violence. END OF SUMMARY.
