SUMMARY:

The article discusses the need for stricter gun control laws in the US following the Orlando nightclub shooting. It cites Australia's example, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The article proposes four steps to reduce the risk of mass shootings: (1) prohibit individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, (2) require federal background checks for all gun sales, (3) strengthen the background check system by including all prohibited purchasers and giving the FBI sufficient time to investigate, and (4) ensure that all prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. Additionally, the article suggests reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes. It argues that the gun industry's opposition to stricter laws stems from its need to boost sales, and that assault weapons are not necessary for self-defense.
