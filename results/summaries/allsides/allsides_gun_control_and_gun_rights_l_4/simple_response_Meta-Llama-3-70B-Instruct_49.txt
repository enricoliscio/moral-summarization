SUMMARY:

The recent mass shooting in Orlando has once again raised questions about the need for stricter gun control laws in the US. In contrast, Australia implemented a complete ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened its gun regulation regime in 1996, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US can take four steps to reduce the likelihood of such tragedies: prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, require federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthen the background check system, and ensure that prohibited purchasers are properly added to the rolls. Additionally, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes can help prevent the sale of deadly weapons. The gun industry's profit-driven motives are a major obstacle to these reforms, but it's morally imperative to prioritize public safety over gun sellers' interests. By taking these steps, the US can reduce the risk of mass shootings and protect its citizens.

END OF SUMMARY.
