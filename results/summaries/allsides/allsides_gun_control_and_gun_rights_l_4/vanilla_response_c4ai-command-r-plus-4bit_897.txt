SUMMARY: House Democrats staged a sit-in to address America's problem with mass shootings, particularly in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Australia's successful gun control efforts after a series of mass shootings in 1996 are highlighted as an example of effective action. Four steps are proposed for the US to reduce gun violence: prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, requiring background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and adding prohibited purchasers to the rolls. The article also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban and addresses the controversial nature of gun control debates. It refutes the notion that assault weapons are necessary for self-defense, citing that brandishing a weapon is usually enough to deter an attack. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgency of taking action to prevent further gun-related tragedies.
END OF SUMMARY.
