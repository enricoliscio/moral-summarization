SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, House Democrats staged a sit-in to demand action on gun control. While America struggles with mass shootings, Australia's success in eradicating them through strict gun regulation offers a stark contrast. Four urgent steps are proposed to reduce gun violence in the US, with a focus on blocking terrorists and other prohibited purchasers from acquiring firearms. These include expanding background checks to all gun sales, strengthening the background check system by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included, and adding those with violent histories like the Orlando shooter to the prohibited list. Additionally, returning to a federal assault weapons ban is advocated, despite potential opposition from gun enthusiasts. The argument is made that assault weapons are unnecessary for self-defense and their deadly nature makes them unsuitable for civilian use. Emphasizing the urgency of the situation, the article calls for immediate action to prevent further loss of life.
