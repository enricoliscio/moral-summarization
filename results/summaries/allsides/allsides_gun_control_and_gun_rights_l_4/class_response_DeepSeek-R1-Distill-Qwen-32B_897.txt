Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the text first.

The article talks about the US struggling with mass shootings, comparing it to Australia's successful gun control after their 1996 ban. The author suggests four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from buying guns, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the system, and ensuring police add prohibited purchasers. They also mention the need for a federal assault weapons ban, arguing against the gun industry's promotion of powerful weapons for profit.

Now, I need to identify the morally charged words: shooting, dealing, diminish, mayhem, profit, prohibited, strengthened, failed, turned, killers, killingnine, kept, added, shooter, abuser, misconduct, tries, pump, stressing, deadly, banned, exceed, fire, revolver.

I should include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long. I'll structure the summary to first mention the problem, then Australia's example, followed by the four steps and the assault weapons ban, highlighting the moral implications like profit, prohibited, deadly, etc.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and flows logically. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is clear and the moral framing is maintained.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the moral imperative to address the problem of mass shootings in the U.S., highlighting the political inaction and the need for effective measures. Australia's response to mass shootings in 1996, which included banning rapid-fire rifles, serves as a moral example, having prevented mass public shootings for 20 years. The author argues that the U.S. must take four steps: prohibiting individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. The article emphasizes the moral failure of current policies, such as the Charleston church shooting, where a killer obtained weapons due to loopholes. Additionally, the author advocates for a federal assault weapons ban, stressing that modern weapons like the AR-15 are too deadly for civilian use and should be banned. The gun industry's profit-driven promotion of such weapons is criticized, with the moral argument that only basic firearms are necessary for self-defense. END OF SUMMARY.
