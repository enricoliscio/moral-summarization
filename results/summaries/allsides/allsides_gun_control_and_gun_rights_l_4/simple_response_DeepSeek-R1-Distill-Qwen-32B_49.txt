Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query first. The user is asking for a summary of a CNN article about gun control measures in the US, comparing it to Australia's approach after mass shootings. The user wants the summary to include the moral framing the author used, which means I need to highlight the ethical arguments and the urgency of the situation.

First, I should identify the main points of the article. The article discusses the lack of progress in the US regarding gun control after the Orlando shooting, contrasts it with Australia's successful approach, and outlines four specific steps the US should take. It also touches on the gun industry's influence and the moral imperative to prevent mass shootings.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral elements. The author emphasizes the need for action, pointing out that the US isn't taking sufficient steps, while Australia did. The four proposals are crucial: banning gun sales to those on the no-fly list, universal background checks, strengthening the background system, and enforcing prohibitions. The article also critiques the gun industry's role in promoting assault weapons, which the author argues are unnecessary for self-defense and contribute to mass shootings.

I should structure the summary to first mention the Orlando shooting and the comparison to Australia, then outline the four steps, and finally address the moral and ethical arguments against assault weapons. I need to ensure that the summary flows logically and maintains the author's tone of urgency and moral necessity for these changes.

Let me start drafting. Begin with the context of the Orlando shooting and the comparison to Australia. Then list the four steps succinctly. Highlight the background checks as a key point, noting that they shouldn't be separate. Mention the need for a federal assault weapons ban as a more controversial step, but stress the moral argument that such weapons are excessive for self-defense.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep it clear. Also, make sure to include the point about the gun industry's tactics to sell more weapons, which ties into the moral framing of profiting from harm.

Finally, wrap it up by emphasizing that these measures are necessary to prevent future tragedies, aligning with the author's moral stance on the issue.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the lack of progress in addressing mass shootings in the U.S., contrasting it with Australia's decisive action after its 1996 gun reforms, which eliminated mass public shootings for 20 years. The author argues that while dramatic action is unlikely in the U.S., there are four feasible steps to reduce gun violence: banning gun sales to those on the "no-fly" list, requiring universal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and ensuring prohibited purchasers are added to the list. The author emphasizes that these measures are non-controversial and necessary to prevent tragedies like the Orlando shooting. Additionally, the article calls for a federal assault weapons ban, arguing that such weapons, like the AR-15, are unnecessary for self-defense and excessively deadly, and should be banned. The moral framing highlights the urgency of action to save lives and reduce gun violence, while criticizing the gun industry's role in promoting dangerous weapons for profit. END OF SUMMARY.
