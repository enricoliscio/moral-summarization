SUMMARY: As the US grapples with yet another mass shooting, this time in Orlando, the country is searching for solutions to prevent such tragedies. While dramatic actions like Australia's successful ban on rapid-fire rifles are unlikely in America, there are four reasonable steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of future massacres. Firstly, suspected terrorists on the no-fly list should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Secondly, federal law should mandate background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from bypassing checks through private sales. Thirdly, the background check system must be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and extending the investigation period. Lastly, the public must take an active role in reporting violent behavior so that individuals like the Orlando shooter, a known wife abuser, are added to the prohibited purchaser list. In addition to these measures, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is warranted, despite opposition from gun enthusiasts. The AR-15, designed for maximum lethality, far exceeds the needs of self-defense and should be banned. It's time to prioritize public safety over the profits of the gun industry and the desires of assault weapon enthusiasts. END OF SUMMARY.
