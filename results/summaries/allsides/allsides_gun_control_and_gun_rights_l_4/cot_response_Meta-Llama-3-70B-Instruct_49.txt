SUMMARY:
In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, House Democrats staged a sit-in to urge action on the country's problem with mass shootings. The US can learn from Australia's example, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. Four steps can be taken to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, requiring federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and taking initiative to add prohibited purchasers to the rolls. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is necessary. The gun industry's profit-driven motives and the National Rifle Association's flawed reasoning on assault weapons must be recognized and addressed. It's time to take action to prevent further "mayhem" and "deadly" attacks. END OF SUMMARY.
