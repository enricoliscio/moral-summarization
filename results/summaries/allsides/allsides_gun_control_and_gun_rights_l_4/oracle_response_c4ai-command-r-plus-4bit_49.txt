SUMMARY: In the wake of recent mass shootings, there is increased pressure to address gun violence in America. While dramatic actions such as Australia's complete ban on rapid-fire rifles are not politically feasible here, there are four reasonable steps that can be taken to reduce the chances of further bloodshed. These include prohibiting gun purchases by those on the no-fly list, mandating background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and evaluated, and encouraging reporting of violent behavior to add individuals like the Orlando shooter to the prohibited list. In addition to improving background checks, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is necessary. Gun sellers object to tighter laws because they need to encourage repeat purchases for self-protection, pushing more powerful and faster-shooting weapons. Modern assault weapons are incredibly deadly and should be banned, as should high-capacity magazines that enable rapid fire of damaging bullets. It is time to take action and protect our citizens from further shootings and mayhem.
END OF SUMMARY.
