SUMMARY: In the wake of the recent mass shooting in Orlando, House Democrats staged a sit-in to demand action on gun control, but what steps can be taken to reduce the chances of future attacks? Four measures are proposed that should be reasonably unobjectionable. Firstly, those on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Secondly, federal law should mandate background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from exploiting loopholes. Thirdly, the background check system must be strengthened to include all prohibited purchasers and allow adequate time for evaluation. Finally, the public must take initiative to ensure that all prohibited purchasers, such as violent abusers, are added to the list. In addition to these measures, a return to the federal assault weapons ban is suggested, despite its controversial nature. The article argues that modern assault weapons are as deadly as machine guns and should be banned, along with high-capacity magazines that enable rapid fire of damaging bullets. The NRA's argument that assault weapons are "protection weapons" permitted by the Second Amendment is refuted. These steps are urged to be taken to prevent extremists from taking advantage of America's lax gun laws and to reduce the devastating impact of mass shootings.
END OF SUMMARY.
