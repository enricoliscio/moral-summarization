SUMMARY: In the wake of the recent mass shooting in Orlando, House Democrats staged a sit-in to demand action on gun control, highlighting the moral urgency to diminish the chances of such tragic mayhem reoccurring. The article proposes four steps to strengthen gun regulation in the United States, with a focus on prohibiting dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms. Firstly, it suggests banning those on the "no-fly" list for suspected terrorist activity from purchasing guns. Secondly, it calls for mandatory federal background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from exploiting loopholes. Thirdly, the background check system should be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and by providing the FBI with adequate time to evaluate each case. Fourthly, public awareness and reporting of violent behavior, such as wife abuse, can help identify and add potential killers to the prohibited purchaser list. Additionally, the article advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, highlighting the immorality of gun sellers profiting from pumping up sales of deadly weapons under the guise of self-protection. It emphasizes that modern assault weapons are excessively lethal and should be banned for civilian use. The article concludes by challenging the notion that assault weapons are necessary for self-defense, underscoring the need for moral courage in the face of industry interests and misguided interpretations of the Second Amendment.
END OF SUMMARY.
