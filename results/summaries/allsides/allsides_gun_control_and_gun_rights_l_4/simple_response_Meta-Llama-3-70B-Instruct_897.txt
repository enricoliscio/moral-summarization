SUMMARY: 

The recent mass shooting in Orlando has once again raised questions about the feasibility of addressing America's problem with mass shootings. In contrast, Australia took drastic measures in 1996, banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US can take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, require federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthen the background check system, and encourage the public to report prohibited purchasers. Additionally, reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes can help. The gun industry's opposition to tighter laws stems from their need to boost sales, as hunting has declined and guns last for decades. It's time to prioritize public safety over gun sellers' profits.
