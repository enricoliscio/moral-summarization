SUMMARY: As the United States grapples with the issue of mass shootings, the article proposes four moral and feasible steps to reduce gun violence. Firstly, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activities should be prohibited from purchasing firearms. Secondly, federal law should mandate background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from circumventing the system through private sales. Thirdly, the background check system needs strengthening by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and providing the FBI with sufficient time to conduct thorough evaluations. Lastly, there must be a concerted effort by law enforcement, prosecutors, and the public to identify and report individuals who should be added to the prohibited purchaser list, such as violent abusers. Additionally, the article advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, arguing that modern assault weapons are as deadly as machine guns and have no place in civilian hands. The proposed measures aim to balance the rights of legitimate gun owners with the need to protect innocent lives and should be supported by all who prioritize public safety over profits from gun sales. END OF SUMMARY.
