SUMMARY:

In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, the US is again left wondering if there's a feasible path to dealing with the country's mass shooting problem. Australia's complete ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 have led to 20 years without a single mass public shooting. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibit purchasers on the "no-fly" list, require federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthen the background check system, and encourage the public to report prohibited purchasers. Additionally, a return to the federal assault weapons ban with tightened loopholes is necessary. The gun industry's profit-driven motives are a major obstacle, as they try to pump up sales by stressing the need for more powerful weapons. It's time to ban deadly weapons like the AR-15 and prioritize public safety over gun sellers' interests.

END OF SUMMARY.
