SUMMARY:

The article discusses the need for stricter gun control laws in the US, citing the example of Australia, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 and has not had a mass public shooting in 20 years. The author proposes four steps to reduce the chances of mass shootings: 1) prohibit individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, 2) require federal background checks for all gun sales, 3) strengthen the background check system by including all prohibited purchasers and giving the FBI sufficient time to evaluate legitimacy, and 4) ensure that prohibited purchasers are properly added to the rolls. The article also advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, citing the deadly nature of modern assault weapons. The author argues that stricter gun laws are necessary to prevent further mayhem and that the gun industry's opposition to such laws is driven by a desire to increase sales.
