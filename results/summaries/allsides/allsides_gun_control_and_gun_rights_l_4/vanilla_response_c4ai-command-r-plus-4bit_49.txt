SUMMARY: In the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting, House Democrats staged a sit-in to demand action on gun control. While America isn't the only country to experience mass shootings, Australia's successful ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations offer a stark contrast, with no mass shootings in 20 years. Four steps are proposed for the US to reduce gun violence: prohibiting suspected terrorists from buying guns, requiring background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system by including all prohibited purchasers, and encouraging reporting of violent behavior to add individuals to the prohibited purchaser list. In addition, the article calls for a return to the federal assault weapons ban and tightening loopholes. Gun sellers object to tighter laws as they try to encourage multiple gun purchases for self-protection, promoting more powerful and faster-shooting weapons. Assault weapons are not credible "protection weapons" and should be banned for civilian use. The article concludes that legitimate gun purchasers would accept minor inconveniences if it meant keeping deadly weapons out of the wrong hands.
END OF SUMMARY.
