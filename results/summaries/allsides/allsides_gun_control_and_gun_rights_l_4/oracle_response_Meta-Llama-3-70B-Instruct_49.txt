SUMMARY: The recent mass shooting in Orlando has sparked a renewed debate on gun control in the US. The country is urged to take action to prevent further mayhem, unlike Australia, which suffered a string of mass shootings before banning rapid-fire rifles and tightening gun regulations, resulting in no mass public shootings in 20 years. The US should take four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibit suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, require background checks for all gun sales, strengthen the background check system, and add prohibited purchasers to the rolls. Additionally, the federal assault weapons ban should be reinstated with tightened loopholes. The gun industry's opposition to tighter laws stems from its need to boost sales by promoting more powerful weapons. The idea that assault weapons are necessary for self-defense is not credible, and allowing them only enables further killing. It's time for the US to take action to prevent further suffering. END OF SUMMARY.
