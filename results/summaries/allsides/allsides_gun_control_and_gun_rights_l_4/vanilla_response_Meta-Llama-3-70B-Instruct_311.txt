SUMMARY: The article discusses the need for stricter gun control laws in the US, citing the example of Australia, which banned rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 and has not had a mass public shooting in 20 years. The article proposes four steps to reduce the chances of mass shootings: 1) prohibit individuals on the "no-fly" list from purchasing guns, 2) require federal background checks for all gun sales, 3) strengthen the background check system by including all prohibited purchasers and giving the FBI sufficient time to evaluate purchasers, and 4) ensure that all prohibited purchasers are added to the rolls. The article also suggests reinstating the federal assault weapons ban, citing the deadly nature of modern assault weapons. The goal is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, while still allowing legitimate gun owners to purchase weapons for self-defense. END OF SUMMARY.
