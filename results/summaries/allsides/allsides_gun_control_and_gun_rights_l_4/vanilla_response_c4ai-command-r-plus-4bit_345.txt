SUMMARY: In the wake of recent mass shootings in Orlando and Charleston, there is a renewed call for gun control measures in the United States. While dramatic actions such as Australia's complete ban on rapid-fire rifles may not be feasible in the US, there are four reasonable steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies. First, individuals on the no-fly list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law should require background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from circumventing the system through private sales. Third, the background check system should be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and by extending the mandated investigation period to allow for thorough evaluations. Fourth, efforts must be made to encourage the reporting of domestic violence and other relevant misconduct so that individuals like the Orlando shooter can be added to the prohibited purchaser list. In addition to these measures, there is also a need to consider reinstating the federal assault weapons ban with tighter loopholes. The gun market has shifted towards promoting more powerful and faster-shooting weapons, and modern assault weapons pose a significant threat to public safety. These steps are essential to reducing gun violence and preventing further loss of life. END OF SUMMARY.
