SUMMARY: In the wake of recent mass shootings in the US, there is a renewed call for gun control measures to reduce the frequency and severity of these tragic incidents. While dramatic actions such as Australia's complete ban on rapid-fire rifles may not be feasible in the US, there are four reasonable steps that can be taken to diminish the chances of future shootings. First, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Second, federal law should require background checks for all gun sales, ensuring that terrorists cannot skip the screening process by purchasing guns through private sales. Third, the background check system needs to be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and by giving the FBI adequate time to evaluate each purchaser. Fourth, the public must take an active role in reporting violent behavior, such as domestic abuse, so that individuals can be added to the prohibited purchaser list. Additionally, there is a need to consider a return to the federal assault weapons ban, despite opposition from gun enthusiasts who view these weapons as "protection weapons" permitted by the Second Amendment. These steps could help reduce the prevalence of mass shootings in the US without infringing on the rights of legitimate gun owners. END OF SUMMARY.
