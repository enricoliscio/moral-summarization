Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about gun control measures in the US, inspired by Australia's actions after mass shootings. The author suggests four steps: prohibiting no-fly list individuals from buying guns, requiring universal background checks, strengthening the background check system, and improving the prohibited purchaser list. They also mention a federal assault weapons ban.

I need to make sure to include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Words like "shooting," "ban," "action," "mayhem," "checks," "included," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

I'll start by highlighting the main points: the context of mass shootings, Australia's example, the four steps, and the assault weapons ban. I'll use the moral terms to convey the urgency and necessity of these measures. I'll structure it to flow logically, ensuring each step is clearly mentioned without going into too much detail. Also, I'll make sure to use the required words to maintain the moral framing as the author intended.

SUMMARY:  
The article addresses the moral imperative to address mass shootings in the U.S., drawing parallels to Australia's successful response through a ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations. The author emphasizes the urgent need for action, particularly after the Orlando shooting, and outlines four key steps to reduce gun violence. First, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing firearms. Second, universal background checks for all gun sales must be required to prevent loopholes. Third, the background check system must be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and giving the FBI adequate time to evaluate legitimacy. Fourth, authorities must actively add prohibited purchasers to the rolls, especially those with violent histories, such as the Orlando shooter. The author also advocates for a federal assault weapons ban, arguing that modern weapons like the AR-15 are too deadly for civilian use and should be banned. These measures aim to prevent mayhem and protect public safety, while addressing the moral failure of lax gun laws. END OF SUMMARY.
