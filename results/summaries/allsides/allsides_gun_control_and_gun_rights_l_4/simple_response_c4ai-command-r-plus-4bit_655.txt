SUMMARY: As the United States grapples with the issue of mass shootings, it is worth noting that Australia, which had a similar problem, successfully addressed it with a complete ban on rapid-fire rifles and tighter gun regulations. While such dramatic action may not be feasible in the US, there are four reasonable steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies. Firstly, individuals on the "no-fly" list due to suspected terrorist activity should be prohibited from purchasing guns. Secondly, federal law should mandate background checks for all gun sales to prevent terrorists from circumventing the system through private sales. Thirdly, the background check system should be strengthened by ensuring all prohibited purchasers are included and by extending the investigation period. Lastly, there must be a concerted effort to add prohibited purchasers, such as violent abusers, to the list. In addition to these measures, there should be a return to the federal assault weapons ban, despite opposition from gun enthusiasts. Gun sellers object to tighter laws because they rely on creating a sense of insecurity and promoting more powerful weapons to boost sales. Assault weapons, designed to be lethally efficient, have no place in civilian hands. The argument that they are necessary for self-defense is unfounded, as the majority of defensive gun use involves brandishing a weapon rather than firing it. It is time to prioritize public safety over profit and take meaningful action to prevent further loss of life.
END OF SUMMARY.
