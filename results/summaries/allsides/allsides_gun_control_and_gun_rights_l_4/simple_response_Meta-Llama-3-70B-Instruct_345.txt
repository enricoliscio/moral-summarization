SUMMARY:

The recent mass shooting in Orlando has once again raised questions about the need for stricter gun control laws in the US. Australia's ban on rapid-fire rifles and tightened gun regulations in 1996 has resulted in no mass public shootings in 20 years. In contrast, the US has been hesitant to take action, despite videos surfacing that urge extremists to take advantage of the country's lax gun laws. The author proposes four steps to diminish the chances of more mayhem: prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, requiring federal background checks for all gun sales, strengthening the background check system, and taking initiative to add prohibited purchasers to the rolls. Additionally, the author advocates for a return to the federal assault weapons ban, citing the deadly nature of modern assault weapons. The gun industry's profit-driven motives are seen as a major obstacle to reform. By taking these steps, the US can reduce the risk of mass shootings and protect its citizens.
