SUMMARY: In a bid to curb hate speech, Reddit has banned over 2,000 communities, including "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum with a history of extreme political ideas and paranoia about "white genocide," and "Gender Critical," an anti-trans, self-described feminist forum. This decision comes amidst ongoing protests for equality and a boycott of Facebook advertisements led by civil rights groups. Reddit's statement acknowledges that all communities must abide by their content policy and that these banned subreddits have consistently broken the rules, antagonized other communities, and failed to demonstrate any intention of reining in their toxic behavior. With nearly 430 million monthly visitors, Reddit's actions send a strong message against online hate speech and signal a commitment to creating a safer online environment for its users. 

END OF SUMMARY.
