SUMMARY:

Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech, including subreddits like "The_Donald", "Gender Critical", and "CapoTrapHouse". This move comes amid ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, and follows several brands' decision to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech. Reddit administrators took action against these communities, citing repeated violations of the site's rules, including hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. The company stated that it is their responsibility to support their communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to craft more rules around hate speech.

END OF SUMMARY.
