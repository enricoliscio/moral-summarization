SUMMARY: Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech, including subreddits such as "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "ChapoTrapHouse." The company stated that these communities broke several rules, including consistently hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. Reddit's statement acknowledged that while they had tried to work with the communities to improve, the issues persisted. The ban comes amid ongoing protests for equality and a movement led by civil rights groups to boycott advertisements on Facebook due to its failure to address hate speech. Reddit acknowledged that this purge is just the beginning of their efforts to create a safer space online and develop more robust policies around hate speech. 

END OF SUMMARY.
