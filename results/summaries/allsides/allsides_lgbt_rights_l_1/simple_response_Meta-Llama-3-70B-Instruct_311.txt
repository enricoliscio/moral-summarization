SUMMARY:

Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. This move comes amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality and follows several brands' decision to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech. The banned communities include subreddits like "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit's decision is a moral imperative, as these communities have consistently broken the site's rules and promoted harmful and discriminatory content. By taking action against these communities, Reddit is taking responsibility for supporting its users and mitigating hate speech on its platform. This move is a crucial step towards creating a safer and more inclusive online environment.
