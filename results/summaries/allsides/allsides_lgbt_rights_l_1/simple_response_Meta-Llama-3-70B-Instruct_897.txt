SUMMARY: 

Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting discriminatory and harmful content. The banned subreddits include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist) forum, among others. These communities have consistently broken Reddit's rules by hosting and upvoting hate speech, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. By taking this action, Reddit is taking responsibility for supporting its communities and mitigating hate speech. The company recognizes that it has a role to play in creating a safer online environment and is committed to crafting more rules around hate speech. This move is a significant step towards promoting equality, inclusivity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their gender, race, or sexual orientation.
