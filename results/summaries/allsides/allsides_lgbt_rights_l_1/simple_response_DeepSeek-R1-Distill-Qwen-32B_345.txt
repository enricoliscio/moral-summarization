Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Reddit shutting down communities for hate speech. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Reddit is closing over 2,000 communities due to hate speech, especially in the context of ongoing equality protests. They mention specific subreddits like "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical." Reddit's reasoning is that these communities broke their content policies, promoting hate speech and failing to moderate properly. They also note that this action follows brands pulling ads from Facebook over similar issues.

I need to capture the moral aspect, which seems to be about responsibility and the fight against hate. Reddit is taking a stand against hate speech, supporting equality and inclusion. It's a proactive move, but there's also criticism about free speech. I should mention both the action and the potential criticisms.

I'll structure the summary to include the number of communities shut down, the context of equality protests, specific examples, Reddit's reasoning, and the broader implications. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft it, making sure to highlight the moral stance and the impact on the platform and its users. I'll also mention the criticism briefly to show a balanced view.

SUMMARY:  
Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities, including "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical," citing violations of its content policies, particularly hate speech, in the context of ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. The platform, with nearly 430 million monthly visitors, argues that these communities consistently hosted rule-breaking content and failed to moderate effectively. "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a radical feminist space, were singled out for promoting hate speech, anti-trans rhetoric, and other harmful content. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to combat hate and support inclusive communities, though critics argue the move risks stifling free speech. The purge is part of a broader effort to enforce stricter rules against hate speech, following similar actions by brands on Facebook. END OF SUMMARY.
