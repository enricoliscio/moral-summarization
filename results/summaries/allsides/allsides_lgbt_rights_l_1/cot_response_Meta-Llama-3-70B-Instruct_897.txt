SUMMARY:
Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The move comes amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. The banned communities include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit administrators have taken action against these communities for breaking several rules, including promoting hate speech and antagonizing other communities. The company has reiterated its commitment to crafting more rules around hate speech and has vowed to take stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. This move is a significant step towards promoting equality and mitigating hate speech on the platform. END OF SUMMARY.
