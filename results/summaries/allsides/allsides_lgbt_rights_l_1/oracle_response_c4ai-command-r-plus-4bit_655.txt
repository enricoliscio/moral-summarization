SUMMARY: In an effort to curtail hate speech and promote equality, Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities that have a history of breaking its content rules and promoting hateful ideologies. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum that has consistently hosted and promoted rule-breaking content, including paranoia about "white genocide" and support for ethnic cleansing. Another banned community is "Gender Critical," a feminist forum that has regularly spewed anti-trans rhetoric and denied that trans women are women. Reddit's statement emphasizes its responsibility to take stronger action against those who try to weaponize its platform to harm others and that this purge is just the start of its mission to better mitigate hate speech. The company's actions come amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality and in response to brands boycotting Facebook over its handling of hate speech. 

END OF SUMMARY.
