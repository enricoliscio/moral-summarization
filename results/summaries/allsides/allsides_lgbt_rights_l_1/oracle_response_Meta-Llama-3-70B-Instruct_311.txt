SUMMARY:

Reddit has taken a bold step to curtail hate speech by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The banned subreddits include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. These communities have broken several rules, including hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. Reddit administrators have worked in good faith to help these communities, but ultimately, they had to take stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. The company reiterated that it's their responsibility to support their communities by taking action against hate speech. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to craft more rules around hate speech and mitigate the harm it causes. By taking a stand against hate speech, Reddit is promoting a safer and more inclusive online environment.

END OF SUMMARY.
