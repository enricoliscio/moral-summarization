SUMMARY: Reddit has banned over 2,000 communities that have a history of breaking its content rules and promoting hate speech. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum that has hosted rule-breaking content and promoted hate speech since before the 2016 election; "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric and denies that trans women are women; and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum. Reddit's statement said that these communities have broken multiple rules, including antagonizing other communities and refusing to meet the company's basic expectations. The company also noted that it had tried to help the communities preserve their spaces by issuing warnings and quarantining, but the mods of these subreddits had not reined in their users. Reddit acknowledged its responsibility to support its communities and take stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of the platform to harm others. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to create more robust rules around hate speech.
END OF SUMMARY.
