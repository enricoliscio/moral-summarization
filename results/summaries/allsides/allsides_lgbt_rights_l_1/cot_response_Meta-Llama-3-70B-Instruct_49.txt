SUMMARY:
Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The move comes amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. The banned communities include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit administrators have taken action against these communities for breaking several rules, including hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. The company has reiterated its commitment to crafting more rules around hate speech and mitigating hate on its platform. This move is seen as a positive step towards creating a safer and more inclusive online space. END OF SUMMARY.
