SUMMARY:

Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech, including subreddits "The_Donald", "Gender Critical", and "CapoTrapHouse". This move comes as several brands have vowed to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech, led by civil rights groups. Reddit administrators stepped in after these communities broke site rules, consistently hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. The banned communities have promoted hate speech, including anti-trans rhetoric and support for ethnic cleansing. Reddit reiterated that this purge is just the start of its mission to craft more rules around hate speech, with the goal of supporting its communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of the platform against others.

END OF SUMMARY.
