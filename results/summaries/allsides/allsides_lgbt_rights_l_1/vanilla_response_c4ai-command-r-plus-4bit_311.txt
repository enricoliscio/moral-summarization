SUMMARY: Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech, including popular subreddits such as "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "ChapoTrapHouse." The decision comes amidst ongoing protests for equality and in the wake of brands boycotting Facebook advertisements to protest hate speech. Reddit's statement cites rule-breaking and a refusal to abide by content policies as reasons for the ban. The company specifically called out "The_Donald" subreddit for promoting extreme political ideas and paranoia about "white genocide," as well as "Gender Critical" for its anti-trans rhetoric and denial of trans women's identities. Reddit acknowledges its responsibility to support its communities and take stronger action against those who weaponize the platform to spread hate. The company also reiterated that this purge is just the beginning of its efforts to create more robust rules around hate speech.
END OF SUMMARY.
