SUMMARY: In an effort to curtail hate speech, Reddit has decided to shut down over 2,000 communities with a history of such content, including "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "ChapoTrapHouse." This decision comes amid protests for equality and civil rights groups urging brands to ban advertisements on social media platforms that allow hate speech. Reddit's statement acknowledges that these communities broke several rules, including hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. The company has tried to help preserve these communities in the past but now acknowledges its responsibility to deal squarely with hate speech and weaponization of its platform. The purge of these 2,000 communities is just the start, as Reddit plans to craft more robust rules around hate speech to better enforce its content policies. 
END OF SUMMARY.
