Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Reddit shutting down communities. Let me read through the article first to get the main points.

So, Reddit is closing around 2,000 communities due to hate speech, especially in the context of ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. They mention specific subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." These communities were violating content policies, promoting hate speech, and their moderators weren't cooperating.

I should note that Reddit has a lot of monthly visitors, making it a major platform. The move follows other brands pulling ads from Facebook over similar issues. The article also gives examples of why each subreddit was banned, like "The_Donald" promoting hate even before the 2016 election and "Gender Critical" denying trans identities.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll include the number of communities closed, the reason (hate speech), mention the specific subreddits, and the context of brands boycotting Facebook. Also, highlight that this is just the start of Reddit's efforts to combat hate speech.

Let me structure this: start with Reddit's action, the number of communities, the reason, mention the specific ones, the context with brands and Facebook, and end with it being the beginning of their enforcement.

I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points without getting too detailed. Avoiding jargon and keeping it clear for a general audience.

SUMMARY:  
Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities, including subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse," for violating its content policies and promoting hate speech. The move comes amid protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality and follows brands boycotting Facebook over hate speech concerns. "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, was banned for hosting rule-breaking content and refusing to meet Reddit's expectations. "Gender Critical," a radical feminist community, was closed for anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to combat hate speech and stated this purge is just the start of stricter enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
