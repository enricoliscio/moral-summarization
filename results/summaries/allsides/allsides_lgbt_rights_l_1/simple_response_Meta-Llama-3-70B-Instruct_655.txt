SUMMARY:

Reddit, one of the most popular websites, has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. This move comes in the wake of several brands vowing to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech, led by civil rights groups. The banned communities include subreddits like "The_Donald", a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical", a TERF forum, which have consistently broken Reddit's rules by hosting and upvoting hate speech. Reddit's argument is that these communities have refused to abide by their content policy, despite warnings and opportunities to correct their behavior. By taking this action, Reddit is taking responsibility to support its communities by mitigating hate speech and promoting a safer online environment. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to craft more rules around hate speech and create a more inclusive platform.
