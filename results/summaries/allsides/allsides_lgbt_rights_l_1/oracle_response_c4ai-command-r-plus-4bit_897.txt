SUMMARY: In a bid to tackle hate speech and promote equality, Reddit has taken a stand by banning over 2,000 communities that have a history of breaking its content rules and promoting hateful ideologies. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum that has consistently antagonized other communities and hosted rule-breaking content, and "Gender Critical," a forum for radical feminists that has spewed anti-trans rhetoric and denied the identity of trans women. These communities have broken Reddit's rules by promoting paranoia about "white genocide," supporting ethnic cleansing, and antagonizing other users. Reddit has a responsibility to support its users and mitigate hate speech, and the company has stated that this purge is just the start of its mission to create a safer online environment for all. The platform will be crafting more robust rules around hate speech to prevent users from weaponizing parts of the site against others. 

END OF SUMMARY.
