SUMMARY:

Reddit, a popular online platform with 430 million monthly visitors, has shut down over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech. The purged communities include subreddits like "The_Donald", a pro-Trump forum, "Gender Critical", a TERF forum, and "CapoTrapHouse", a radical left forum. Reddit administrators took action after several brands vowed to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech. The company cited rule-breaking content, antagonism towards other communities, and refusal to meet basic expectations as reasons for the ban. The banned communities have a history of promoting hate speech, with "The_Donald" promoting extreme political ideas and "Gender Critical" spewing anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit reiterated its commitment to crafting more rules around hate speech, stating that it's their responsibility to support their communities by taking stronger action against hate speech.
