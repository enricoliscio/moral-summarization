SUMMARY:

Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech, including subreddits "The_Donald", "Gender Critical", and "CapoTrapHouse". The move comes amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, and follows several brands vowing to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech. Reddit administrators took action against these communities, citing repeated rule-breaking and refusal to meet basic expectations. The banned communities have promoted hate speech, including anti-trans rhetoric and support for ethnic cleansing. Reddit stated that it is their responsibility to support their communities by taking stronger action against hate speech, and that this purge is just the start of their mission to craft more rules around hate speech.

END OF SUMMARY.
