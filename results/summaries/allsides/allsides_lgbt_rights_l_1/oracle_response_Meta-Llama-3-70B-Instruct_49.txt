SUMMARY:

Reddit has taken a bold step to curtail hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The banned communities include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. These communities have broken several rules, including hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. Reddit administrators have worked to help these communities preserve their space, but ultimately, they have refused to take responsibility for their actions. The company has reiterated its commitment to crafting more rules around hate speech and taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. By taking this step, Reddit aims to mitigate the hate speech that has been promoted on its platform, including support for ethnic cleansing and denying trans women access to bathrooms. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to create a safer and more inclusive online environment.
