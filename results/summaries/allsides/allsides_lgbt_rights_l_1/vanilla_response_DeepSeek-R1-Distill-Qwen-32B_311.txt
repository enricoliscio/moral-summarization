Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Reddit shutting down some communities. Let me read through it first.

The article says Reddit is closing around 2,000 communities because of hate speech, especially amid protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. Reddit is a big site with 430 million monthly visitors. They're targeting subreddits like "Gender Critical," "The_Donald," and "CapoTrapHouse." These communities have a history of violating content policies.

I should mention that these subreddits were removed because they broke rules, like promoting hate speech and not following community guidelines. Reddit's statement explains they gave warnings and tried other measures but had to ban them. "The_Donald" was problematic since 2015, promoting extreme ideas and hate speech. "Gender Critical" is a feminist community but uses anti-trans rhetoric.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll include the main points: number of communities closed, reasons (hate speech, rule violations), examples of subreddits, and the impact on Reddit's efforts to combat hate speech.

I should structure it clearly, starting with the action Reddit took, then the reasons, examples, and the significance of this move. Make sure it's within the word limit and flows well.

SUMMARY:  
Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities, including "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse," due to hate speech and rule violations. These subreddits were banned for consistently hosting harmful content, despite warnings and attempts to reform. "The_Donald," created in 2015, promoted extreme political ideas and hate speech, while "Gender Critical" targeted transgender individuals with anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to combat hate speech and stated this purge is just the beginning of stricter enforcement.  
END OF SUMMARY.
