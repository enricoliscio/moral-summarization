SUMMARY: 
In its ongoing fight against hate speech, Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities that have a history of rule-breaking and promoting hateful content. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that denies the identity of trans women, and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum. Reddit's statement emphasized that all communities must abide by their content policy in good faith and that those who break the rules will be held accountable. The company specifically called out "The_Donald" and "CapoTrapHouse" for consistently hosting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to rein in their members. Reddit acknowledged its responsibility to support its communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of the platform against others. The company also reiterated that this purge is just the beginning of its efforts to create a safer space for all users and to craft stronger rules around hate speech. 
END OF SUMMARY.
