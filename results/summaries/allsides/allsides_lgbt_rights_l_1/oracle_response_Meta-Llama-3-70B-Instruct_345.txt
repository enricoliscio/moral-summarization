SUMMARY:

Reddit, one of the most popular websites, has taken a bold step to curtail hate speech by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The banned communities include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. These communities broke several rules, hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. Reddit's administrators worked in good faith to help these communities preserve their space, but ultimately had to take stronger action against those who tried to weaponize parts of the platform against others. The company reiterated that this purge is just the start of its mission to craft more rules around hate speech. By taking responsibility to support its communities, Reddit aims to mitigate hate speech and promote a safer online environment.

END OF SUMMARY.
