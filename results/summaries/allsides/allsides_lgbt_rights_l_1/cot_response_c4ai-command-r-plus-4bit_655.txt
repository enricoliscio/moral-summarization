SUMMARY: In an effort to curb hate speech and promote equality, Reddit has taken a stand against online hate by shutting down over 2,000 communities with a history of rule-breaking and harmful content. Among those purged are well-known subreddits such as "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, "Gender Critical," a TERF forum, and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left community. Reddit's decision comes amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, and in support of brands boycotting Facebook advertisements to address hate speech. 

Reddit's statement highlights their commitment to upholding their content policy and creating a safe space for users. They acknowledge their responsibility to deal squarely with hate and support their communities. The company specifically calls out "The_Donald" and "ChapoTrapHouse" for consistently hosting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to moderate their users. Similarly, the "Gender Critical" subreddit is noted for its anti-trans rhetoric and hateful discussions, denying the rights and identities of trans women. 

With this purge, Reddit sends a strong message against hate speech and upholds its moral obligation to create a safer online environment. The company reiterates that this is just the beginning of their mission to enforce stricter rules and mitigate the weaponization of hate speech on their platform. 

END OF SUMMARY.
