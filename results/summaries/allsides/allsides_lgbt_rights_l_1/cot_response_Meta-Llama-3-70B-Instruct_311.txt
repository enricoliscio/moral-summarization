SUMMARY:
Reddit, one of the most popular websites, has taken a strong stance against hate speech by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. This move comes amid ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. The banned subreddits include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit administrators argue that these communities broke several rules, including hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. The company reiterated its commitment to crafting more rules around hate speech and taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to mitigate hate speech on its platform. END OF SUMMARY.
