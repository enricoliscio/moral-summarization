Okay, so I need to summarize this Reddit news article. Let me read through it carefully. The main points are that Reddit is shutting down around 2,000 communities because of hate speech. These communities include some well-known ones like "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical." The reason is to support equality movements and respond to brands boycotting Facebook over similar issues. Reddit's content policy is the basis for these bans, and they've been giving warnings and other measures but decided to remove them now. The banned subreddits have a history of breaking rules, like promoting hate speech and not following moderation expectations. Reddit sees this as a start to more strict policies against hate speech.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." I should mention the number of communities, the reason (hate speech against equality movements), the notable subreddits, the brands' actions on Facebook, Reddit's content policy, the history of warnings, and their commitment to further action. I should keep it concise, making sure each key point is covered without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Reddit has closed approximately 2,000 communities, including "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical," due to hate speech, aligning with efforts to support gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. This move follows brands boycotting Facebook over hate speech. The banned subreddits violated Reddit's content policy, promoting hate and failing to moderate effectively. Reddit emphasizes its responsibility to combat hate and plans further measures to enforce stricter policies. END OF SUMMARY.
