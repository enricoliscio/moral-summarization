Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Reddit shutting down communities. They mentioned that I need to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, okay, I should focus on the ethical implications here.

First, I need to read through the article carefully. It's about Reddit removing 2,000 communities due to hate speech, especially in the context of ongoing protests for equality. The author highlights specific subreddits like "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical," which are known for problematic content.

I should note that Reddit's action is part of a broader trend, with brands pulling ads from Facebook over hate speech. This shows a societal push against such content. The moral angle here is about responsibilityâ€”Reddit taking action to uphold community safety and equality.

I need to mention the specific subreddits and why they were banned, like promoting hate speech and violating content policies. Also, the article points out that these communities have been problematic for a while, which adds to the moral justification for their removal.

The user wants a summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll start by stating Reddit's action, the number of communities, and the context of equality protests. Then, mention the specific subreddits and the reasons for their banning. Finally, tie it back to the broader movement against hate speech and Reddit's commitment to enforcing policies.

I should make sure the summary flows well and captures the moral stance without getting too detailed. Keeping it clear and within the word limit is key. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all important points are included without exceeding the length.

SUMMARY:  
Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities, including "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse," for violating its content policies, particularly for promoting hate speech. This move comes amid growing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality and follows brands boycotting Facebook over hate speech. Reddit, with nearly 430 million monthly visitors, emphasized its responsibility to combat hate and protect its users. "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, was banned for consistently hosting rule-breaking content and refusing to moderate effectively. "Gender Critical," a radical feminist community, was also banned for anti-trans rhetoric and denying trans women's rights. Reddit's action reflects a broader societal push to hold platforms accountable for fostering inclusive spaces. The company stressed that this purge is just the beginning of stricter enforcement against hate speech.  
END OF SUMMARY.
