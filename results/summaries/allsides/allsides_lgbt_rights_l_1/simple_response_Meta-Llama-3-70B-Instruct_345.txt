SUMMARY:

Reddit has taken a bold step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting discriminatory rhetoric. This move comes amidst protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, and follows several brands' decision to boycott Facebook ads in protest of hate speech. The banned subreddits include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that has consistently denied the humanity of trans women. Reddit administrators have taken this action due to the communities' consistent violation of site rules, including hosting and upvoting hate speech, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. By taking a strong stance against hate speech, Reddit is reaffirming its responsibility to support its communities and promote a safer online environment. This purge is just the beginning of Reddit's mission to craft more rules around hate speech and create a more inclusive platform.
