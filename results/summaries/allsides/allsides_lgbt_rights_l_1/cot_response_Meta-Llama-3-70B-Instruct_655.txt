SUMMARY:
Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The move comes amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. The banned subreddits include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit's decision is a response to several brands vowing to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech, led by civil rights groups. The company has reiterated its commitment to crafting more rules around hate speech, stating that it's their responsibility to support their communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to mitigate hate speech on its platform. END OF SUMMARY.
