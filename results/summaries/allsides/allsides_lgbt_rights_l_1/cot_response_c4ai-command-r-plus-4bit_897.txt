SUMMARY: 
In an effort to curb hate speech and promote equality, Reddit has taken a stand against online hate by shutting down over 2,000 communities with a history of hateful content. The company's decision comes amidst ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, and follows a movement led by civil rights groups to boycott advertisements on social media platforms that fail to address hate speech. 

Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum that has promoted extreme political ideas and paranoia about "white genocide"; "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that has consistently spewed anti-trans rhetoric and denied the identity of trans women; and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum. 

Reddit's statement acknowledged that these communities had broken its content policies and that their moderators had refused to take action despite warnings and quarantines. The company emphasized its responsibility to support its communities and take stronger action against those who weaponize the platform to target marginalized groups. 

This mass banning is just the beginning of Reddit's mission to create a safer online environment, and the company has pledged to continue developing policies to address hate speech and enforce its content guidelines. 

END OF SUMMARY.
