SUMMARY: Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities that have a history of breaking its content rules and promoting hate speech. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum that has consistently hosted and upvoted rule-breaking content, antagonized other communities, and promoted paranoia about "white genocide" and ethnic cleansing. Another banned subreddit, "Gender Critical," is a TERF forum that has regularly denied that trans women are women and spewed anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit's statement acknowledged that it is their responsibility to support communities and take stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of the platform to harm others. The company also reiterated that this purge is just the start of their mission to create more robust rules around hate speech.

END OF SUMMARY.
