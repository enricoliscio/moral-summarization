SUMMARY: In a moral stand against hate speech, Reddit has taken action to shut down over 2,000 communities that have perpetuated harmful rhetoric. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum that has a history of promoting extreme political ideas and hate speech, "Gender Critical," a forum that denies the rights and identities of trans women, and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum. Reddit's decision comes amidst growing protests for equality and civil rights groups pressuring social media platforms to address hate speech. The company stated that these communities consistently broke rules, antagonized others, and refused to meet basic expectations. Notably, "The_Donald" has a long history of promoting ethnic cleansing and paranoia about "white genocide." Similarly, "Gender Critical" has consistently denied the rights and identities of trans women, supporting harmful rhetoric. Reddit acknowledges its responsibility to support its communities and take stronger action against those who weaponize the platform to harm others. The company also plans to continue crafting more robust rules around hate speech to create a safer online environment. 

END OF SUMMARY.
