SUMMARY: 

Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The banned subreddits include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, "Gender Critical," a TERF forum, and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum, among others. These communities have consistently broken Reddit's rules by hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet the site's basic expectations. "The_Donald" has a history of promoting hate speech, including support for ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Myanmar, while "Gender Critical" has spewed anti-trans rhetoric, denying trans women their identity and advocating for their exclusion from bathrooms. By taking stronger action against these communities, Reddit aims to mitigate hate speech and create a safer space for its users. This purge is just the start of the company's mission to craft more rules around hate speech.

END OF SUMMARY.
