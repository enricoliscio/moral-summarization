Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Reddit shutting down communities due to hate speech. They also listed specific morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Reddit is taking action against hate speech by banning thousands of communities, including "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical." These communities were breaking rules by hosting and promoting hate speech, which led to their banning. The author uses words like "banned," "hosted," "promoted," "hate," and "weaponize," so I need to make sure these are included.

Next, I'll identify the key events: the shutdown of over 2,000 communities, the specific examples given, and Reddit's reasoning. I should highlight how these communities broke rules, hosted hate speech, and the impact on other communities. Also, mention the civil rights groups and brands boycotting ads on Facebook as context.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. I'll start by stating Reddit's action, then the reasons, examples, and the consequences. I'll make sure to use the morally framed words to maintain the author's perspective.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all important points are covered and the moral framing is preserved. I'll check the word count and adjust if necessary to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities for breaking its content policy, including "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum. These communities were banned for consistently hosting rule-breaking content, promoting hate speech, and antagonizing other communities. "The_Donald" was singled out for its history of hate speech, including discussions of "white genocide" and ethnic cleansing. "Gender Critical" was criticized for denying trans women's identities and spewing anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to mitigate hate speech and support its communities by enforcing stricter rules. The purge of these communities is part of a broader effort to combat hate speech, following brands boycotting Facebook ads over similar concerns. The company stressed that all communities must adhere to its content policy in good faith, and those failing to do so will face consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
