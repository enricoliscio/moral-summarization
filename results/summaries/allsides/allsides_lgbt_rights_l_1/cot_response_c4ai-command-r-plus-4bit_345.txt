SUMMARY: 
Reddit has taken a stand against hate speech by shutting down more than 2,000 communities with a history of hateful content. This decision comes amidst ongoing protests advocating for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum that has promoted extreme political ideas and hate speech since its creation in 2015; "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that has consistently denied the identity of trans women and promoted anti-trans rhetoric; and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum. Reddit's statement highlights that these communities have broken its rules by antagonizing other communities and refusing to rein in their rule-breaking content. The company acknowledges its responsibility to support its users and mitigate hate through policy enforcement. This purge is just the beginning of Reddit's efforts to create a safer online environment by implementing stricter rules around hate speech.
