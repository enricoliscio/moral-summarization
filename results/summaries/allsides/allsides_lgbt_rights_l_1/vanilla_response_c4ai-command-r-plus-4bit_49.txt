SUMMARY: In an effort to combat hate speech, Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hateful content, including subreddits such as "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "ChapoTrapHouse." These communities were banned for consistently breaking site rules and promoting content that antagonized other communities. Reddit's statement emphasized that all communities must abide by their content policy and that the banned subreddits had failed to do so despite multiple warnings and attempts at moderation. The company acknowledged that it is their responsibility to support its users by taking stronger action against those who weaponize the platform to target others. The purge of these communities is part of Reddit's ongoing efforts to create a safer and more inclusive environment for its users, with a focus on addressing hate speech. The company also reiterated that this is just the beginning of their work to create more robust rules and enforcement around hate speech.
END OF SUMMARY.
