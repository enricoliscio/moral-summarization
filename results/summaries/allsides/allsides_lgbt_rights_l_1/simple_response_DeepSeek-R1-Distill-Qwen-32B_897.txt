Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Reddit shutting down 2,000 communities for hate speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the reasons behind the shutdown, the impact, and the context of the broader movement against hate speech.

First, the article mentions that Reddit is taking action due to ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. That sets a moral context about fighting against discrimination. I should highlight that Reddit is curbing hate speech, which aligns with promoting equality.

Next, the article lists specific subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." These were problematic for different reasons: promoting hate speech, anti-trans rhetoric, etc. I need to mention these examples to show the scope of the issue.

It's important to note that Reddit's decision comes after brands boycotting Facebook due to hate speech. This shows a trend where platforms are being held accountable for their content, which adds to the moral argument of responsibility in content moderation.

The article also details Reddit's process: they tried warnings and other measures before banning. This shows that the action was taken after attempts to correct the behavior, emphasizing that it was a necessary step.

Additionally, the article mentions the influence of upvoting and how problematic content could still be prominent. This highlights the challenges in enforcing rules on user-generated content platforms.

Finally, Reddit's statement about their responsibility to support communities by taking stronger action ties back to the moral imperative of preventing hate speech. I should end the summary by noting that this is just the start of their efforts, indicating a commitment to ongoing improvement.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include all these points. I'll structure it by first stating the action, then the reasons, the examples, the context, and the implications. This way, the moral framing of promoting equality and responsible content moderation is clear.

SUMMARY: Reddit has taken action to combat hate speech by banning over 2,000 communities, including controversial subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." These communities were shut down for violating content policies, such as promoting hate speech, anti-trans rhetoric, and other rule-breaking behaviors. The move follows broader efforts to address hate speech, with brands boycotting platforms like Facebook and civil rights groups advocating for change. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to enforce rules and support inclusive communities, though some argue the platform's moderation tools, like upvoting, allowed problematic content to persist. This purge marks the beginning of stricter measures to curb hate speech, reflecting a growing societal push for equality and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
