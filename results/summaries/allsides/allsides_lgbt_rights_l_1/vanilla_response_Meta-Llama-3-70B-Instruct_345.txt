SUMMARY:

Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech, including subreddits "The_Donald", "Gender Critical", and "CapoTrapHouse". The move comes amid ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, and follows several brands vowing to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech. Reddit administrators cited the communities' consistent hosting and upvoting of rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusal to meet basic expectations as reasons for the ban. The company stated that it is their responsibility to support their communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. The purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to craft more rules around hate speech.

END OF SUMMARY.
