Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Reddit shutting down communities for hate speech. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Reddit is removing around 2,000 communities because of hate speech, especially in the context of ongoing protests for equality. The article mentions specific subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." These communities have been breaking Reddit's rules, including promoting hate speech and not following policies.

I should highlight Reddit's justification: they're enforcing their content policy to prevent hate speech. It's important to mention that this action is part of a broader trend, like brands pulling ads from Facebook over similar issues. 

Also, the article points out that these communities were problematic for a long time, even before the 2016 election. "Gender Critical" is particularly noted for anti-trans rhetoric, supporting TERF views, and opposing inclusive language. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it captures the moral aspectâ€”Reddit taking responsibility to combat hate speech and support equality. I'll structure it to first state the action, then the reasons, and conclude with the broader implications.

SUMMARY: Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities, including "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse," for violating its hate speech policies. This move follows growing pressure to address hate speech amid protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality. The banned communities were found to consistently host rule-breaking content, antagonize others, and resist moderation efforts. "The_Donald," for instance, has long promoted extreme political ideas and hate speech, while "Gender Critical" has been a hub for anti-trans rhetoric and opposition to inclusive language. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to combat hate and support equality, signaling this purge as part of a broader effort to strengthen hate speech policies. END OF SUMMARY.
