SUMMARY: In a moral stand against hate speech, Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities, including prominent forums such as "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse," which have a history of promoting harmful content. This decision comes amidst ongoing protests for equality and a boycott of Facebook advertisements by brands and civil rights groups. 

Reddit acknowledged that all communities must abide by their content policy, and the banned subreddits had consistently broken the rules, refused to cooperate, and fostered environments antagonistic to other users. "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, had a history of extreme political ideas and paranoia about "white genocide," while "Gender Critical," a TERF forum, regularly denied the identity of trans women and supported J.K. Rowling's anti-trans rhetoric. 

Reddit's statement emphasized their responsibility to support their communities and take stronger action against those who weaponize their platform. They also reiterated that this purge is just the beginning of their efforts to create a safer online environment by implementing stricter rules around hate speech. 

END OF SUMMARY.
