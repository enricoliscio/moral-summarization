Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Reddit is shutting down over 2,000 communities due to hate speech, especially in the context of ongoing equality protests. They mention specific subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." 

I should note the moral words used, such as "banned," "hosted," "upvoted," "rule-breaking," "antagonized," "promoted," "genocide," "spews," "denied," "weaponize," "hate," and "mitigate." These words carry a strong moral judgment, so I need to include them in the summary.

The summary should be concise, around 200 words. I'll start by stating Reddit's action, then mention the specific subreddits and why they were banned. I'll include the reasons like promoting hate speech, breaking rules, and the impact on the community. I should also mention the broader context of brands boycotting Facebook and Reddit's ongoing efforts to combat hate speech.

I'll make sure to use the moral words where appropriate and keep the summary focused on the key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step: introduction of the action, reasons for banning, examples of problematic subreddits, and the implications of the move. Finally, I'll conclude with Reddit's commitment to enforcing stricter policies.

SUMMARY:  
Reddit has banned over 2,000 communities, including "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse," for hosting hate speech and breaking its content policies. These subreddits were accused of promoting hate, antagonizing others, and consistently hosting rule-breaking content. "The_Donald" was singled out for its long history of hate speech, including discussions on "white genocide" and ethnic cleansing. "Gender Critical" was banned for spewing anti-trans rhetoric and denying trans women's identities. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to mitigate hate and support communities by taking stronger action. The purge is part of an ongoing effort to craft stricter rules against hate speech, following brands' boycott of Facebook over similar issues. END OF SUMMARY.
