SUMMARY:
Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The move comes amid ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, and follows several brands' decision to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech. The purged communities include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, and "Gender Critical," a TERF forum that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit administrators argued that these communities broke several rules, including hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. The company reiterated its commitment to supporting its communities by taking stronger action against hate speech and crafting more rules around hate speech. END OF SUMMARY.
