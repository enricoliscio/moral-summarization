SUMMARY: Reddit has banned over 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech, including prominent subreddits such as "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." The decision comes amid ongoing protests for equality and a boycott of Facebook advertisements by brands and civil rights groups. Reddit's statement cites rule-breaking and a refusal to comply with site policies as reasons for the ban. Subreddits are typically user-run, but Reddit administrators can intervene when necessary. The company specifically called out "The_Donald" for promoting extreme political ideas and hate speech, and "Gender Critical" for its anti-trans rhetoric. With this purge, Reddit reiterates its commitment to curbing hate speech and plans to continue developing policies to address it. 

END OF SUMMARY.
