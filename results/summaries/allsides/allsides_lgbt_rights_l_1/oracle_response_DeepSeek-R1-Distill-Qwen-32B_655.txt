Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Reddit is shutting down 2,000 communities due to hate speech, targeting subreddits like "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical." They mention the communities broke rules, hosted hate speech, and antagonized others. The author uses specific moral terms like "ban," "hosted," "upvoted," etc., which I need to include.

I should start by identifying the key elements: Reddit's action, the number of communities, the reasons (breaking rules, hate speech), and the impact on equality movements. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words as much as possible without making the summary too long. Also, I need to mention the context of brands boycotting Facebook and the support for equality. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with Reddit's decision, the communities affected, the reasons, and the broader implications.

I should avoid adding any personal opinions or extra information not in the article. Keeping it concise under 200 words is important. Let me draft a summary that hits all these points while using the specified moral terms. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's clear and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
Reddit has banned over 2,000 communities for breaking its content policies, including those hosting hate speech and rule-breaking content. Subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse" were shut down for consistently promoting hate speech, upvoting rule-breaking posts, and antagonizing other communities. "The_Donald" was particularly problematic, promoting extreme political ideas and hate speech since its creation in 2015. "Gender Critical" was also banned for spewing anti-trans rhetoric, denying trans women's identities, and discussing denying them bathroom access. Reddit emphasized its responsibility to mitigate hate and support equality movements, stating that the purge is just the start of stricter hate speech rules. The move follows brands boycotting Facebook over hate speech, highlighting the broader push for accountability in online spaces. END OF SUMMARY.
