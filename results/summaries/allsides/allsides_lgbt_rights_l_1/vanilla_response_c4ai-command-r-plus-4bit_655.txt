SUMMARY: In an effort to curb hate speech, Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting such content. Among the banned subreddits are "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, "Gender Critical," a forum for anti-trans rhetoric, and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum. Reddit's decision comes amid ongoing protests for equality and a boycott of Facebook advertisements by brands in protest of hate speech. The company stated that the banned communities had consistently broken site rules and that their moderators had shown no intention of reining in their users. "The_Donald," in particular, has a history of promoting extreme political ideas and paranoia, while "Gender Critical" has been known for its anti-trans stance. Reddit acknowledged that it has a responsibility to support its communities and take stronger action against those who try to weaponize the platform. The company also reiterated that this purge is just the beginning of its efforts to create more robust rules around hate speech.
END OF SUMMARY.
