SUMMARY: In a moral stand against hate speech, Reddit has decided to ban over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hateful and discriminatory content, including subreddits such as "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." The decision comes amidst ongoing protests for equality and civil rights groups pressuring social media platforms to take a stand against hate speech. 

Reddit's statement acknowledged that all communities must abide by their content policy, and the banned subreddits had consistently broken the rules, including antagonizing other communities and refusing to rein in their users. The company specifically called out "The_Donald" for promoting hate speech, with its users espousing paranoia about "white genocide" and supporting ethnic cleansing. Similarly, "Gender Critical," a self-proclaimed feminist community, regularly denied the identity of trans women and promoted anti-trans rhetoric. 

Reddit acknowledged its responsibility to support its communities and take stronger action against those who weaponize the platform to spread hate. The company also reiterated that this purge is just the beginning of their efforts to create a safer online environment by implementing stricter rules around hate speech. 

END OF SUMMARY.
