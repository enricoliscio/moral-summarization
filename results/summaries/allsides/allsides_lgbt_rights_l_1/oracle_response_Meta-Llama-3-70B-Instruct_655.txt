SUMMARY:

Reddit has taken a significant step towards curbing hate speech on its platform by shutting down over 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The banned subreddits include "The_Donald," a pro-Trump forum, "Gender Critical," a TERF forum, and "CapoTrapHouse," a radical left forum, among others. These communities have consistently broken Reddit's rules, hosting and upvoting rule-breaking content, antagonizing other communities, and refusing to meet basic expectations. "The_Donald" has promoted hate speech since its creation in 2015, while "Gender Critical" has spewed anti-trans rhetoric, denying trans women their identity and promoting harmful discussions. Reddit's decision to ban these communities is a necessary step towards mitigating hate speech on its platform. The company acknowledges that it's their responsibility to support their communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against others. This purge is just the start of Reddit's mission to craft more rules around hate speech.
