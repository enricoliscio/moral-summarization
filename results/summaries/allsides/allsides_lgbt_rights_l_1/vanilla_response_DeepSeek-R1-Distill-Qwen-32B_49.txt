Okay, I need to summarize this article about Reddit shutting down communities. Let me read through it carefully. 

The main points are: Reddit is closing about 2,000 communities due to hate speech, especially in the context of current equality protests. They've named some subreddits like "The_Donald" and "Gender Critical." Reddit has 430 million monthly visitors, making it a major platform. The action follows brands pulling ads from Facebook over hate speech, led by civil rights groups. 

Subreddits are user-run, but Reddit can step in if rules are broken. The banned communities broke rules like promoting hate speech and antagonizing others. "The_Donald" was problematic even before 2016, promoting extreme ideas and hate. "Gender Critical" is a feminist group that's anti-trans. Reddit says this is part of a larger effort to combat hate speech.

I should make sure the summary includes the number of communities, the reason (hate speech), the notable subreddits, the context of the ad boycott, and that this is part of a broader initiative. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me structure it: start with the action, reasons, context, specific examples, and the broader plan.

I think that covers all the key points without getting too detailed. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.

SUMMARY: Reddit has shut down over 2,000 communities for violating its hate speech policies, targeting subreddits like "The_Donald," "Gender Critical," and "CapoTrapHouse." The move follows brands boycotting Facebook ads over hate speech, led by civil rights groups. Subreddits are user-run, but Reddit intervenes when rules are broken. "The_Donald" promoted hate speech pre-2016, and "Gender Critical" spread anti-trans rhetoric. Reddit aims to enforce stricter policies against hate speech, with this purge being part of a broader initiative. END OF SUMMARY.
