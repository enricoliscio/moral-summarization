Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's campaign in Pennsylvania. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

So, Trump is holding a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and he's facing a lot of issues. There's the tape where he bragged about groping women, some Republicans are defecting, and his poll ratings are dropping. But at the rally, he didn't mention any of that. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton by talking about appointing a special prosecutor and referencing WikiLeaks documents. 

He praised WikiLeaks and mentioned a Russian news outlet, Sputnik, which might tie him to Russia. This is a problem because Clinton's campaign thinks Russia hacked the emails to help Trump. Trump also made a mistake by misrepresenting an email from Sidney Blumenthal, which backfired.

At another rally, Trump tried to defend his comments about groping women, calling it "locker room talk." His surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, even made a joke about it. Trump's supporters seem to ignore the scandal, but outside his rallies, his campaign is struggling. Paul Ryan, the House speaker, stopped supporting him, and polls show Clinton leading by 11 points.

 McCain also withdrew support, saying Trump's comments about women were unacceptable. Clinton is gaining in swing states like Ohio, and Obama is helping her campaign.

So, the summary should cover Trump's rally, his attacks on Clinton, the issues with Russia and WikiLeaks, the loss of support from Republicans, and the polls showing Clinton ahead. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's rally, mention the issues he avoided, his attacks on Clinton, the Russia connection, the rally supporters, and the external problems like defections and polls. Make sure each point is clear and brief.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump addressed his supporters in Pennsylvania, avoiding mention of the groping tape, Republican defections, and falling poll ratings. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor and referencing WikiLeaks documents, which were inaccurately sourced from a Russian news outlet. Trump praised WikiLeaks and made a joke about groping, while his surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, trivialized the issue. Despite his rally success, Trump's campaign faces trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves and Clinton leading in polls. McCain also withdrew support, citing Trump's offensive remarks. Clinton is strengthening her lead in key states like Ohio, with Obama aiding her campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
