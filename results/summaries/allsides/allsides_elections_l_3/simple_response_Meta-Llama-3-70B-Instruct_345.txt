SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a leaked tape showed him bragging about sexual assault. Despite this, Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. He also praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government hacking, and made an erroneous claim about Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk." However, Trump's campaign is facing significant backlash, with many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, abandoning him. A recent poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 11 points nationally, and she is solidifying her lead in key swing states. Trump's behavior, including his hostile stance towards Clinton during the presidential debate, has generated widespread unease and outrage.

END OF SUMMARY.
