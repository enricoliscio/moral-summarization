Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to preserve the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points and the tone.

The article is about Donald Trump's campaign after the release of the groping tape. It describes his rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he avoided talking about the scandal. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, mentioning a special prosecutor and using WikiLeaks information, which turned out to be inaccurate. The article also mentions Republican defections, like Paul Ryan and John McCain, who withdrew support because of Trump's offensive comments, especially about women. Trump's supporters defend his behavior, but his poll ratings are dropping, and Clinton is gaining ground, especially in key states like Ohio.

The moral framing here seems to be critical of Trump. The article highlights his avoidance of the scandal, his inaccurate attacks on Clinton, and the negative impact on his campaign due to the defections. It also shows the contrast between Trump's loyal supporters and the broader Republican party's disapproval.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points while maintaining that critical tone. I should mention the rally, the avoidance of the scandal, the inaccurate WikiLeaks claims, the Republican defections, and the impact on his campaign. Also, highlight the moral issues like the offensive comments and the contrast between his supporters and the party's stance.

I'll structure the summary to first talk about Trump's rally and avoidance of the scandal, then his attacks on Clinton, the inaccuracies, the defections, and the resulting trouble in his campaign. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral elements are clear.

Let me draft it:

SUMMARY: Donald Trump avoided addressing the groping tape scandal at his Pennsylvania rally, instead focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton using inaccurate WikiLeaks claims. His campaign faces trouble as key Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, withdraw support due to his offensive remarks. Trump's supporters defend his behavior, but his poll ratings drop as Clinton gains ground, especially in swing states like Ohio. The article highlights the moral issues surrounding Trump's campaign, emphasizing the contrast between his loyal base and the broader Republican party's disapproval. END OF SUMMARY.

Wait, that's 106 words. I can add more details to reach closer to 200 without going over. Maybe include more about the inaccurate claims, the specific examples from McCain, and the impact on the campaign.

Let me revise:

SUMMARY: Donald Trump avoided addressing the groping tape scandal at his Pennsylvania rally, instead focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton using inaccurate WikiLeaks claims. His campaign faces significant trouble as key Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, withdraw support due to his offensive remarks. McCain specifically criticized Trump's treatment of women, highlighting the moral issues surrounding the campaign. Trump's supporters defend his behavior, but his poll ratings drop as Clinton gains ground, especially in swing states like Ohio. The article emphasizes the contrast between Trump's loyal base and the broader Republican party's disapproval, suggesting the campaign's unraveling despite Trump's efforts to rally his supporters. END OF SUMMARY.

That's 134 words. I can add more details about the rally, the WikiLeaks inaccuracies, and the impact on the campaign.

Let me try again:
