SUMMARY:
Donald Trump held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he fired up his diehard supporters and made no mention of the recent scandal involving a leaked tape of him making offensive comments about sexually assaulting women. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton and threatening to prosecute her if he becomes president. Trump also praised WikiLeaks and made controversial statements about the Benghazi attack, which could backfire due to his perceived closeness with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Despite Trump's attempt to brush off the groping scandal as "locker room talk," his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan effectively dumping him and refusing to defend his actions. Clinton, meanwhile, has solidified her lead in national polls and key swing states such as Ohio. The article also highlights John McCain's public condemnation of Trump's comments, stating that he could no longer support the nominee due to his demeaning remarks towards women. McCain's decision underscores the growing unease within the Republican Party about Trump's candidacy. END OF SUMMARY.
