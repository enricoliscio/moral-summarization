SUMMARY:

Donald Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, ignoring the controversy surrounding his leaked 2005 tape and Republican defections. He repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government hacking. Trump also falsely claimed that Clinton's adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, admitted that Clinton failed to protect American personnel in Benghazi, Libya. The claim was based on an inaccurate report by a Russian government-sponsored news agency. Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans distancing themselves from him, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. A recent opinion poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 11 points nationally, and she is solidifying her lead in key swing states like Ohio. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, have downplayed the groping tape controversy, calling it "locker room talk."

END OF SUMMARY.
