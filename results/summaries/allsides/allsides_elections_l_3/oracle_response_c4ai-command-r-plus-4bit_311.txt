SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign is facing an ethical crisis after a recording surfaced of him bragging about sexually assaulting women. The tape has caused an uproar, leading to Republican defections and a plunge in poll ratings. Ignoring the controversy, Trump instead threatened to prosecute Hillary Clinton and praised WikiLeaks, adopting an erroneous report by a Russian news agency. This backfired, given previous accusations of being too friendly with Vladimir Putin. Trump dismissed the groping tape as "locker room talk," but his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan effectively abandoning him. Clinton is now leading in national polls and solidifying her advantage in key swing states. The situation has prompted John McCain to publicly renounce Trump, citing his demeaning remarks and attacks on women as reasons for withdrawing support. McCain will instead write in the name of a qualified conservative Republican.
END OF SUMMARY.
