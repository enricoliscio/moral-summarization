SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's campaign is in a state of catastrophic disarray after a leaked tape revealed his offensive comments about sexually assaulting women. Despite the backlash, Trump refused to apologize and instead fired up his loyal supporters at a rally in Pennsylvania. He repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, and praised WikiLeaks, which has been accused of being a conduit for Russian government-sponsored hacking. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape as "locker room talk," which many found phony and disparaging. The Republican party is in a state of profound unease, with many senior members, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, dumping Trump and refusing to defend him. Clinton, meanwhile, is solidifying her lead in key swing states, with many seeing her as a more legitimate and qualified candidate. END OF SUMMARY.
