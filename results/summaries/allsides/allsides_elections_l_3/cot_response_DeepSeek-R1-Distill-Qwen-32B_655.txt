Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. Then, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these morally charged words as possible.

First, I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "groping," "sexual assault," "defections," "plummeting," "controversy," "locker room talk," "overly complimentary," "scandal," "unease," "condemned," "outrage," "offensive," "demeans,"
