SUMMARY:

Donald Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, ignoring the controversy surrounding the leaked tape of him making offensive comments about women. He instead focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, promising to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her alleged crimes if elected. Trump also praised WikiLeaks and repeated an erroneous report from a Russian government-sponsored news agency about Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal. Despite his energetic performance, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with many senior Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, distancing themselves from him. A new opinion poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 11 points nationally, and she is also solidifying her lead in key swing states like Ohio. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, have also been criticized for downplaying the significance of the leaked tape.

END OF SUMMARY.
