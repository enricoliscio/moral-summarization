SUMMARY: Donald Trump rallied supporters in Pennsylvania, ignoring the recent scandals involving his offensive comments and instead focusing on his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. He praised WikiLeaks and made erroneous claims about Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal. Trump's surrogates defended his controversial remarks as "locker room talk" and tried to shift focus to attacking Clinton. Despite Trump's efforts, his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves from him. Opinion polls show Clinton leading Trump nationally and in key swing states like Ohio. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, publicly renounced his support for Trump due to his demeaning comments about women.
END OF SUMMARY.
