SUMMARY:

Donald Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, ignoring the controversy surrounding the leaked tape of him bragging about sexual assault. He repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government-sponsored hacking. Trump also falsely claimed that Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal had admitted that Clinton was responsible for the Benghazi attack. The crowd responded enthusiastically, but Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, distancing themselves from him. A new poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 11 points nationally, and she is solidifying her lead in key swing states like Ohio. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, have downplayed the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk." Despite the controversy, Trump's supporters remain loyal, but his campaign is struggling to recover from the scandal.

END OF SUMMARY.
