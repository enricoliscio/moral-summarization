SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a leaked tape revealed his offensive comments about women. Despite this, Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, making no reference to the controversy. Instead, he threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praised WikiLeaks, a group that has leaked US government secrets. Trump also adopted an erroneous report from a Russian government-sponsored news agency, which claimed Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal admitted she had failed to protect American personnel in Benghazi. This attack on Clinton backfired, as Trump has been accused of being overly complimentary about Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk." Despite Trump's efforts to rally his base, his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan, abandoning him and Clinton solidifying her lead in key swing states.
