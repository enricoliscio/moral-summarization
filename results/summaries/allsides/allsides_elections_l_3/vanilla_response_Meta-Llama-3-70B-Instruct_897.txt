SUMMARY:

Donald Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania on Monday night, ignoring the controversy surrounding a 2005 recording where he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Instead, he repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes, which sparked chants of "Lock her up!" from the crowd. Trump also praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government-sponsored hacking, and misinterpreted an email from Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Republican candidate's campaign remains in trouble, with many party members abandoning him publicly, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. A recent opinion poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 11 points nationally, and she is solidifying her lead in key swing states like Ohio. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, have downplayed the groping tape scandal, calling it "locker room talk."

END OF SUMMARY.
