Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points and the author's tone. The article talks about Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, his handling of the groping tape scandal, his campaign issues, and the reactions from supporters and critics.

The user wants the summary to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I should make a list of those words provided: tape, bragged, using, assault, comments, grabbing, suggest, threat, lock, praised, conduit, adopt, report, hacked, called, something, claim, death, extracted, account, reported, attack, sway, bragging, kiss, grab, issue, joke, quip, phony, dismissed, stance, threatened, interrupted, jabbed, stood, scandal, mistreating, remarks, taunted, preferred, say, disparaging, attacks, demeans, part, qualified.

I need to ensure that the summary includes these words where appropriate. I should structure the summary to cover Trump's actions at the rally, his deflection of the scandal, the support from his base, the negative reactions from Republicans and Clinton, and the overall impact on his campaign.

I'll start by highlighting Trump's avoidance of the scandal, then mention his supporters' defense, his attack on Clinton using WikiLeaks, and the inaccuracies in his claims. I'll include the mention of Paul Ryan distancing himself and the polls showing Clinton's lead. I'll also note McCain's withdrawal of support and the overall campaign struggles.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented in the article, maintaining the author's critical tone towards Trump's actions and the implications for his campaign.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump, facing a spiraling disaster from the release of a tape where he bragged about grabbing women's genitals, appeared at a rally in Pennsylvania, avoiding mention of the scandal. His supporters suggested such behavior wasn't assault, while Trump focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, threatening to "lock her up" and praising WikiLeaks, which he used to spread claims about Clinton's Benghazi role, though these were based on inaccurate reports. Trump also renewed his defense, calling his 2005 remarks "locker room talk," while his surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, turned the issue into a joke. Despite his braggadocio and attempts to rally his base, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with key Republicans, including Paul Ryan, distancing themselves from him. Polls show Clinton leading nationally and in swing states like Ohio. McCain, a Republican senator, withdrew support, citing Trump's attacks on women and others. Trump's campaign, marked by controversy and scandal, faces mounting challenges as his poll ratings plummet. END OF SUMMARY.
