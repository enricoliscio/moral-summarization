SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign suffered a catastrophic 72 hours following the release of a decade-old recording where he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Despite this, Trump made no mention of the scandal at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, instead repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. Trump's comments generated further controversy as he praised WikiLeaks and made erroneous claims based on a Russian news agency's inaccurate reporting of leaked documents. Trump's surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, also turned the groping scandal into a joke. Despite Trump's attempts to fire up his base, his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan effectively dumping him. Opinion polls show Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally, and she is solidifying her lead in key swing states such as Ohio. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, also renounced his support for Trump, citing his attacks on women as a step too far.
END OF SUMMARY.
