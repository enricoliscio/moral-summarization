Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The summary needs to be under 200 words and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump's campaign after the release of the groping tape. He's making appearances, ignoring the scandal, and attacking Hillary Clinton. He's using WikiLeaks and Russian news outlets for information, which is problematic. His supporters are backing him, but there are defections in the Republican party. Polls show Clinton leading, and McCain withdrew support.

I need to highlight the moral issues: the groping tape, sexual assault, defying party members, using WikiLeaks as a conduit for leaks, adopting a report from a Russian source, attacking Clinton, and the scandal's impact on his campaign. Also, include how he's dismissed concerns as political correctness and his aggressive campaign tactics.

I should structure the summary to cover Trump's actions, the reactions from supporters and Republicans, the polls, and the implications of his strategies. Make sure to use the moral words like "tape," "bragged," "assault," "defections," "grabbing," "suggested," "threat," "praised," "conduit," "adopted," "report," "hacked," "attacked," "scandal," "mistreating," "defections," "attacks," "demeans," "part."

I need to be concise, so I'll mention each point briefly, ensuring the moral framing is clear. I'll start with Trump's rally, his ignoring the scandal, his attacks on Clinton, the use of WikiLeaks, the Russian report, the botched attack, McCain's defection, the polls, and the overall campaign trouble.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the key moral elements and keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump addressed his supporters in Pennsylvania, ignoring the fallout from the released groping tape, which showed him bragging about grabbing women's genitals, and the subsequent Republican defections. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her and her campaign. Trump praised WikiLeaks, a conduit for leaked government secrets, and adopted a report from a Russian news outlet to falsely claim Clinton's adviser admitted fault over the Benghazi incident. This botched attack could backfire, as Trump has been accused of mistreating people and being overly complimentary toward Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump's supporters dismissed concerns about the tape as political correctness, but his campaign faces trouble outside his rallies. Senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, have distanced themselves from him. Polls show Clinton leading, with an 11-point advantage nationally and gains in key swing states. Trump's aggressive campaign tactics, including threats and interruptions during debates, have deepened the scandal's impact. His dismissal of the tape as "locker room talk" and Rudy Giuliani's joking about it further alienated critics. Despite his efforts, Trump's campaign remains in turmoil, with McCain and others denouncing his attacks on women and society. END OF SUMMARY.
