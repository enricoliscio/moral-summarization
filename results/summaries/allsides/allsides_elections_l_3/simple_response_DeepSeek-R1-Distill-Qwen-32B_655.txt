Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is asking for a news summary from a moral perspective, so I should focus on the ethical implications and the author's stance.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. It's about Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, his campaign issues, the groping tape, Republican defections, and his strategies. The moral angle is important hereâ€”Trump's behavior and its impact on his campaign and the Republican party.

I notice the article mentions how Trump avoided addressing the groping tape and instead focused on attacking Hillary Clinton. This shows a moral failing, as he's not taking responsibility for his actions. The mention of Rudy Giuliani trivializing the issue adds to the moral critique.

The article also talks about Trump's supporters and how they dismiss concerns about the tape, highlighting a divide in values between his base and the broader public. This is a crucial moral point because it shows a lack of accountability and respect for women.

Additionally, the article discusses the impact on the Republican party, with Paul Ryan and John McCain distancing themselves. This indicates a broader moral issue within the party, as they can't support Trump's behavior.

I need to ensure the summary captures these elements without being too lengthy. I'll focus on Trump's avoidance of the issue, his supporters' reactions, the ethical implications of his campaign tactics, and the consequences for the party.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to highlight the moral failing and the resulting fallout, keeping it concise and within 200 words. I'll make sure to include key points like the rally, the tape, the supporters' dismissal, and the party's reaction to maintain the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania highlighted his campaign's moral failings as he avoided addressing the controversial groping tape and instead focused on attacking Hillary Clinton. Despite Republican defections and plummeting poll ratings, Trump energized his supporters by threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. He also praised WikiLeaks and cited inaccurate Russian reports to accuse Clinton of mishandling the Benghazi attack, further deepening ties with Russia. Trump's supporters dismissed concerns about the tape, framing it as "locker room talk," while his surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, trivialized the issue. Trump's campaign, relying on divisive rhetoric and promises to his base, faces growing opposition from senior Republicans like Paul Ryan and John McCain, who have distanced themselves from him. Clinton, meanwhile, is gaining ground in polls and key swing states. Trump's refusal to take responsibility for his actions and his supporters' dismissal of ethical concerns underscore a broader moral divide in the campaign. END OF SUMMARY.
