SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's campaign suffered a spiraling disaster over the weekend, as an 11-year-old recording of him making catastrophic and offensive comments about sexually assaulting women was released. Despite this, Trump's mood at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was effervescent, and he succeeded in generating further controversy with his insurrectionary stance. He made no reference to the scandal, instead firing up his loyal and dedicated base of supporters with threats of prosecuting Hillary Clinton. However, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans such as Paul Ryan dumping him and expressing unease over his candidacy. The moral condemnation of Trump extended beyond his party, with many Republicans publicly abandoning him in shameful repudiation of his disrespectful comments about women. Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, renounced Trump, stating that he must "part company" with Trump due to his demeaning and disparaging remarks. END OF SUMMARY.
