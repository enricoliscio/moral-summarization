Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's campaign events. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Trump holding a rally in Pennsylvania despite the groping tape scandal and declining poll numbers. He didn't address the scandal but focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, mentioning a special prosecutor and the Benghazi incident. There's confusion about the source of his claims, possibly from a Russian news outlet. His supporters are loyal, but there's Republican defection, like Paul Ryan and John McCain distancing themselves. Clinton is leading in polls, especially in swing states.

I should include the main points: the rally, ignoring the scandal, attacks on Clinton, issues with sources, loyal supporters, Republican opposition, and Clinton's lead.

Now, I'll structure this into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to cover all these aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump held a rally in Pennsylvania, focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton and ignoring the recent scandals, including the groping tape and Republican defections. He threatened to appoint a special prosecutor for Clinton and referenced the Benghazi incident, citing claims from WikiLeaks documents, though these were later found to be based on inaccurate reporting by a Russian news outlet. Trump's supporters remained loyal, but senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, distanced themselves from him. Clinton maintains a significant lead in national polls and key swing states like Ohio. Trump's campaign continues to face challenges despite his efforts to rally his base. END OF SUMMARY.
