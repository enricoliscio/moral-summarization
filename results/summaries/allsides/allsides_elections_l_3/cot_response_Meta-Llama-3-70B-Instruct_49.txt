SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's campaign is in a catastrophic state after a tape surfaced of him bragging about sexually assaulting women. Despite the offensive comments, Trump avoided addressing the issue at a rally in Pennsylvania, instead firing up his loyal supporters by threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. Trump's backers suggest that his comments are not sexual assault, but rather "locker room talk." The Republican candidate's hostile stance towards Clinton and his praise for WikiLeaks have generated further controversy. Meanwhile, senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, have abandoned Trump, citing his offensive comments about women as a key reason. Clinton has solidified her lead in key swing states, and Trump's campaign remains in considerable trouble. END OF SUMMARY.
