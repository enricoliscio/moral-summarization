SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a tape surfaced of him bragging about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women. Despite this, Trump made no reference to the tape or the many Republican defections at a rally in Pennsylvania. Instead, he fired up his supporters by repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. He also praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government hacking, and adopted an erroneous report from a Russian government-sponsored news agency. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the tape as "locker room talk" and even turned it into a joke. However, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with many senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, distancing themselves from him. Clinton has taken an 11-point lead nationally and is solidifying her lead in key swing states. Trump's remarks have been widely criticized as offensive and disparaging towards women and other groups.
