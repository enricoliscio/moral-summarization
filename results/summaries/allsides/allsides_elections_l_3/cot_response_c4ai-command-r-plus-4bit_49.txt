SUMMARY:
Donald Trump rallied his diehard supporters in Pennsylvania, choosing to ignore the disastrous fallout from the groping tape, Republican desertions, and his plummeting poll ratings. He made no reference to the offensive comments in the tape or the wave of Republicans who abandoned him in protest. Instead, he continued to threaten Hillary Clinton with prosecution and jail, generating further controversy by praising WikiLeaks and adopting erroneous reports from a Russian news agency. Trump's surrogates dismissed the groping scandal as mere "locker room talk", and his supporters dismissed concerns as political correctness. Despite his ebullient mood and the hothouse atmosphere of the rally, Trump's campaign remains in trouble. Senior Republicans, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have effectively dumped Trump and refused to defend him. Clinton has solidified her lead in key swing states, and Trump's incendiary and insulting remarks about women, Mexicans, Muslims, prisoners of war, and a Gold Star family have led many Republicans to part company with him. Even Senator John McCain, who was previously insulted by Trump, has renounced his support, calling Trump absolutely wrong and saying it is impossible to continue to offer even conditional support.
END OF SUMMARY.
