SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's campaign is in a catastrophic state after a 2005 recording surfaced, where he bragged about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women. Despite the offensive comments, Trump's diehard supporters are standing by him, with some even suggesting that grabbing women's genitals is not sexual assault. At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump fired up his loyal followers by repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. He also praised WikiLeaks, which has been accused of being a conduit for Russian government secrets. Trump's campaign is in trouble, with many senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, publicly distancing themselves from him. Clinton, on the other hand, is solidifying her lead in key swing states, with an 11-point lead nationally over Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
