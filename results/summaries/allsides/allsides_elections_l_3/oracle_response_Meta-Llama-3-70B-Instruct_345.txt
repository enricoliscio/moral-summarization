SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a tape surfaced of him bragging about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women. Despite this, Trump avoided addressing the issue at a rally in Pennsylvania, instead focusing on threatening Hillary Clinton with a special prosecutor and praising WikiLeaks, which has been accused of being a conduit for Russian government-sponsored hacking. Trump also adopted an erroneous report from a Russian news agency, using it to attack Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The crowd responded with chants of "Lock her up!" and Trump agreed, saying "Lock her up is right!" Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk" and even making a joke about it. However, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with many senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, distancing themselves from him. Clinton, on the other hand, is solidifying her lead in key swing states and has slammed Trump's "weak excuse for mistreating people."

END OF SUMMARY.
