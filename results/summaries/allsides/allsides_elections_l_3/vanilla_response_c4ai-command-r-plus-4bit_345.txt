SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign suffered a blow as a recording of him making lewd comments about women was released, causing Republican defections and a drop in poll ratings. Despite the controversy, Trump made no reference to the tape during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he fired up his supporters by threatening to prosecute Hillary Clinton. Trump also praised WikiLeaks and made erroneous claims about Clinton's adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, based on a Russian news agency's report. Trump's surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, dismissed the groping controversy as "locker room talk." Meanwhile, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves from him. Opinion polls show Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally, and she is solidifying her lead in swing states like Ohio. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, also renounced his support for Trump due to his demeaning comments about women.
END OF SUMMARY.
