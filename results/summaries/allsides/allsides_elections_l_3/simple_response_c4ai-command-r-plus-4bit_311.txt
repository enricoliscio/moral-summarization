SUMMARY: Donald Trump's presidential campaign has been plagued by a series of controversies and scandals, including the release of a tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Despite the backlash and growing unease among Republicans, Trump remains defiant and continues to fire up his loyal base with promises of prosecuting Hillary Clinton and reiterating his controversial policy proposals. He has also embraced WikiLeaks and made erroneous attacks on Clinton, potentially backfiring given his perceived closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russian interference in the US election. Trump's defense of his comments as "locker room talk" and his surrogate's jokes about the issue highlight a dismissive attitude towards the severity of his actions. Meanwhile, Trump's hostile debate performance and his disregard for the groping scandal have not improved his campaign's situation, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan effectively dumping him. Clinton is solidifying her lead in national polls and swing states, while Republicans like John McCain have publicly renounced their support for Trump due to his offensive remarks and demeaning attitude towards women.
END OF SUMMARY.
