SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a leaked tape revealed his offensive comments about women. Despite this, Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, making no reference to the controversy. Instead, he repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government hacking. Trump also made an erroneous claim about Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal, citing a Russian government-sponsored news agency. The crowd responded with chants of "Lock her up!" Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape as "locker room talk." Meanwhile, senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, have distanced themselves from Trump, citing his offensive comments and behavior. Clinton has solidified her lead in national polls and key swing states. Trump's campaign is in disarray, and his actions are being seen as an attempt to distract from his own controversies.

END OF SUMMARY.
