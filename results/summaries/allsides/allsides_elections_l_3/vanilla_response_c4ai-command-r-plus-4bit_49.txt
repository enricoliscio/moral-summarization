SUMMARY: Donald Trump rallied supporters in Pennsylvania, ignoring the fallout from the recent scandal involving his comments on sexually assaulting women. He instead focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her and praising WikiLeaks for their leaks of US government secrets. Trump also repeated claims that Sidney Blumenthal admitted Clinton could have done more regarding the Benghazi attack, though this was based on an erroneous report. Trump's surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, made light of the groping scandal, joking about it during his speech. Despite Trump's efforts, his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves from him. Recent polls show Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally, and she is also solidifying her lead in key swing states like Ohio. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, also renounced his support for Trump due to his offensive remarks towards women.
END OF SUMMARY.
