SUMMARY:

Donald Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, ignoring the controversy surrounding a 2005 tape where he bragged about sexually assaulting women. He repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praised WikiLeaks, which has released hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman. Trump also falsely claimed that Clinton's adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, admitted that Clinton had failed to protect American personnel in Benghazi, Libya. The claim was based on an inaccurate report by a Russian government-sponsored news agency. Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, distancing themselves from him. A recent opinion poll shows Clinton leading Trump nationally by 11 points, and she is solidifying her lead in key swing states like Ohio. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, have also come under fire for downplaying the groping tape scandal.

END OF SUMMARY.
