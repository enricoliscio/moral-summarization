SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign is in a downward spiral after a tape revealed him bragging about sexually assaulting women. Many Republicans have abandoned him, and his poll ratings have plummeted. Trump, however, ignored the controversy during a rally in Pennsylvania, instead threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praising WikiLeaks. He also made erroneous claims about Clinton's adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, and the Benghazi attack, citing a Russian news agency's inaccurate report. Trump's surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, turned the issue into a joke. Despite Trump's attempts to fire up his base, his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves from him. Clinton, meanwhile, is solidifying her lead in key swing states, and Trump faces backlash for his demeaning comments about women and other groups.
END OF SUMMARY.
