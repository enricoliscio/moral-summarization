Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral aspects highlighted.

The article talks about Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, where he's facing several issues. There's the tape where he bragged about grabbing women, which is a clear moral issue. His campaign is struggling with defections from his party and his poll ratings are dropping. He's making threats against Hillary Clinton, which is another moral concern because it's aggressive and not appropriate for a candidate.

He praised WikiLeaks, which is known for leaking sensitive information, possibly with Russian involvement. This ties into the hacking of emails, which is a breach of privacy and trust. His supporters are dismissing concerns about the tape, showing a divide in how different groups perceive the issue.

There's also the part where Trump conflates information from WikiLeaks, leading to inaccurate claims about Clinton's involvement in Benghazi. This is misleading and could be seen as an attempt to undermine her credibility, which is another moral failing.

Additionally, Trump's campaign is facing internal issues with senior Republicans distancing themselves, like Paul Ryan, which shows a lack of support and confidence in his leadership. McCain's decision to abandon Trump is another significant moral stance, highlighting the unacceptability of Trump's behavior.

I need to make sure to include the morally charged words the author used, such as "tape," "bragged," "assault," "comments," "grabbing," "threat," "praised," "hacked," "attack," "scandal," "threatened," "interrupted," "jabbed," "demeans," etc.

I should structure the summary to cover Trump's rally, his aggressive tactics, the moral issues surrounding his comments and actions, the impact on his campaign, and the reactions from within his party and other figures like McCain.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key moral points without getting bogged down in every detail. I'll make sure each sentence reflects the moral framing by using the specified words.

Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring each point ties back to the moral aspects highlighted.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump faced a moral crisis as he rallied in Pennsylvania, avoiding mention of the tape where he bragged about grabbing women, a form of sexual assault. Despite Republican defections and plummeting polls, Trump threatened Hillary Clinton with a special prosecutor, inciting his supporters to "lock her up." He praised WikiLeaks, a conduit for leaked documents, and inaccurately attacked Clinton over Benghazi, highlighting his misleading tactics. Trump's aggressive stance, including threats and interruptions during debates, deepened the scandal. His supporters dismissed concerns, but senior Republicans, like Paul Ryan, distanced themselves, signaling unease. McCain abandoned Trump, citing his attacks on women and society, opting to support a qualified conservative instead. Trump's campaign remained in turmoil, with Clinton gaining ground in polls and key states. END OF SUMMARY.
