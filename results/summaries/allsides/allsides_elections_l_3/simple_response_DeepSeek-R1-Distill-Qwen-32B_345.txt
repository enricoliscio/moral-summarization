Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania. He's facing issues like the groping tape, losing support from Republicans, and his poll numbers dropping. He didn't address these problems at the rally. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, even making controversial statements about WikiLeaks and Russia's involvement in the election.

He repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor against Clinton, which caused more controversy. He also made a mistake by misquoting a document from WikiLeaks, which backfired because it tied him to Russia, a point his opponent was already using against him.

At another rally, he defended his comments about grabbing women as "locker room talk," and his surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, even joked about it. Despite all this, Trump's campaign is struggling. His support among senior Republicans is dwindling, with Paul Ryan distancing himself from him. Polls show Clinton leading, especially in key states like Ohio.

 McCain, a prominent Republican, also withdrew support, citing Trump's offensive remarks towards women and others. The article highlights the moral issues Trump's campaign is facing, like the groping scandal and his hostile approach, which are causing significant problems for his campaign.

So, the summary should cover Trump's rally, his avoidance of the scandal, his attacks on Clinton, the controversies, his supporters' reactions, the loss of Republican support, and the polls showing Clinton's lead. I need to keep it under 200 words and preserve the moral framing, emphasizing the ethical issues and the campaign's troubles.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump addressed his supporters in Pennsylvania, avoiding mention of the recent scandals surrounding his campaign, including the release of a tape where he bragged about sexually assaulting women and the defection of Republican allies. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, repeating threats to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her and praising WikiLeaks, which has been accused of leaking documents tied to Russian interference in the election. Trump also misquoted a WikiLeaks document, incorrectly suggesting Clinton's adviser admitted fault over the Benghazi incident, a claim based on a flawed report from a Russian news outlet. His supporters chanted "Lock her up!" as he stoked their anger. Trump defended his controversial remarks about grabbing women as "locker room talk" and dismissed concerns about the tape as political correctness. Meanwhile, his campaign faces growing trouble, with senior Republicans distancing themselves, including Paul Ryan, and Clinton leading in polls, including in key swing states like Ohio. McCain withdrew support, citing Trump's offensive remarks. Trump's focus on hostility and moral controversies has deepened his campaign's crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
