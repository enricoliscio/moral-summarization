SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's presidential campaign has hit a catastrophic bump in the road, following the release of an old recording where he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Despite the scandal, Trump avoided the topic during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, instead firing up his diehard supporters by threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. Trump's controversial comments come amidst a wave of Republican defections and plummeting poll ratings. The GOP nominee also generated further controversy by adopting an inaccurate report and praising WikiLeaks. Trump's hostile behavior towards Clinton during the debate and his bragging about groping women have put his campaign in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan effectively dumping him. Clinton now leads by 11 points nationally, solidifying her lead in key swing states. Trump's offensive comments and demeaning attitude towards women have caused even the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, to part company and renounce their nominee. The moral framing of this article highlights the scandalous and offensive nature of Trump's actions and their potential impact on the election.
END OF SUMMARY.
