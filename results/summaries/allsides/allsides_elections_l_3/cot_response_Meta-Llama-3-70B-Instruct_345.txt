SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's campaign is in a catastrophic state after a leaked tape revealed his offensive comments about women. Despite the backlash, Trump continued to fire up his loyal supporters at a rally in Pennsylvania, repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. He also praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government-sponsored news agencies, and adopted an erroneous report relating to a recent WikiLeaks stash of documents. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk." However, many Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, have abandoned Trump, citing his offensive comments about women and other groups. Clinton, meanwhile, has solidified her lead in key swing states and nationally, with an 11-point lead in a recent opinion poll. END OF SUMMARY.
