SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign has suffered a setback following the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Despite the controversy, Trump made no reference to the incident during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, instead focusing on his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. Trump also praised WikiLeaks and made erroneous claims about Clinton's adviser, Sidney Blumenthal. Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, has distanced himself from Trump's comments, while senior Republicans have abandoned Trump, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. Opinion polls show Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally, and she is also solidifying her lead in key swing states such as Ohio. Trump's controversial remarks have drawn criticism from many, including 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, who has renounced his support for Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
