SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign suffered a catastrophic blow as a recording of him bragging about sexually assaulting women was released, leading to a wave of Republican defections and a plummet in poll ratings. Ignoring the controversy, Trump rallied supporters in Pennsylvania, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and embracing WikiLeaks. He also made erroneous claims about Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal and Benghazi, possibly influenced by a Russian news outlet. Despite attempts to divert attention, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with Speaker Paul Ryan effectively dumping him. Clinton gains an 11-point lead nationally, solidifying her advantage in swing states. Trump's offensive comments and behavior towards women, prisoners of war, minorities, and the disabled have caused widespread outrage, leading to increasing isolation from his own party. Even Senator John McCain, once mocked by Trump, has renounced his support.
END OF SUMMARY.
