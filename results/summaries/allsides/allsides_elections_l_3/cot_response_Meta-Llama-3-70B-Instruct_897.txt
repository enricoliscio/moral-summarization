SUMMARY:
Donald Trump's campaign is in a state of catastrophic disarray after a tape surfaced of him bragging about sexually assaulting women. Despite the offensive comments, Trump's loyal supporters remain unwavering, with some even suggesting that grabbing women's genitals is not sexual assault. At a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump fired up his base by repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. He also praised WikiLeaks, which has been accused of being a conduit for Russian government secrets. Trump's campaign is plagued by profound unease among senior Republicans, with many, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, publicly distancing themselves from him. Clinton, meanwhile, is solidifying her lead in key swing states and has slammed Trump's "weak excuse for mistreating people." END OF SUMMARY.
