Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's campaign in Pennsylvania. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and they specified the format with "SUMMARY:" at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It seems to cover Trump's rally in Wilkes-Barre, his avoidance of the groping tape scandal, his attacks on Hillary Clinton, the impact of WikiLeaks, and the distancing of Republican leaders like Paul Ryan and John McCain.

I should focus on the key events: Trump not addressing the scandal, his focus on Clinton's emails, the inaccurate claims about Benghazi, the support from his base, and the defections within the Republican party. Also, the poll numbers showing Clinton leading.

I need to condense these points into a coherent summary without getting bogged down in details. I'll make sure to mention the rally, his strategy, the WikiLeaks situation, the Republican defections, and the poll results.

I should also keep the language clear and straightforward, avoiding any markdown or special formatting. The summary needs to be under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive.

Let me structure it: start with Trump's rally, his avoidance of the scandal, his attacks on Clinton using WikiLeaks info, the inaccuracies, his support from the base, the Republican leaders distancing themselves, and the poll numbers. That should cover the main points succinctly.

I'll make sure each sentence is tight and only includes the essential information. Also, check that I'm not including any unnecessary details that don't contribute to the main summary.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and flows well. Make sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: Donald Trump held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he avoided discussing the recent scandal involving an 11-year-old tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, falsely claiming her aide admitted fault over the Benghazi incident, based on inaccurate Russian reports. Trump also praised WikiLeaks, deepening ties with Russia amid accusations of Russian interference in the election. Despite his loyal supporters cheering, Trump's campaign faces significant challenges, including Republican defections and Clinton's rising poll numbers. Senior Republicans, like Paul Ryan and John McCain, have distanced themselves from Trump, with McCain even considering writing in another conservative candidate. Clinton leads Trump nationally and in key swing states like Ohio, as Trump struggles to contain the fallout from the scandal. END OF SUMMARY.
