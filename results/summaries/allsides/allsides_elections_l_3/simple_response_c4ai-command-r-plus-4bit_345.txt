SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign suffered a major setback as an 11-year-old recording of him bragging about sexually assaulting women was released, causing Republican defections and a plunge in poll ratings. Ignoring the controversy, Trump focused on attacking Hillary Clinton during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her. He praised WikiLeaks and made erroneous claims about Clinton's adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, based on a report by a Russian news agency. Trump's defense of his comments in the tape as "locker room talk" and his surrogate Rudy Giuliani's joke about it indicate a lack of remorse. Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with Speaker Paul Ryan effectively dumping him and polls showing Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, also renounced Trump due to his demeaning comments about women, stating that he will write in the name of a conservative Republican instead. Trump's actions and statements reveal a lack of moral responsibility and a disregard for the impact of his words and actions on others.
END OF SUMMARY.
