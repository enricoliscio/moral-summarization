SUMMARY: Donald Trump held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he fired up his supporters by reiterating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes if he becomes president. He praised WikiLeaks and made controversial statements about Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal and the Benghazi attack, based on an inaccurate report by a Russian news agency. Trump avoided mentioning the recent groping tape scandal and Republican defections, instead focusing on familiar campaign promises. Despite his confident demeanor, Trump's campaign faces significant challenges, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves from him. Clinton has gained an 11-point lead nationally, and is solidifying her advantage in key swing states like Ohio. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, publicly renounced his support for Trump due to his demeaning comments about women.
END OF SUMMARY.
