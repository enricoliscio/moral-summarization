Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump, but I have to make sure I keep the moral framing that the author used. The user also wants me to first identify all the morally framed words in the article. Let me read through the article again to understand the context and pick out those words.

The article talks about Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, his handling of the groping tape scandal, his supporters, his attacks on Clinton, and the fallout from his comments. I notice words like "scandal," "offensive," "controversy," "locker room talk," "sexual assault," "defections," "abandoned," "protest," "alleged crimes," "special prosecutor," "Clinton," "WikiLeaks," "hacked," "Benghazi," "admits," "conspiracy," "Trumpistas," "unease," "condemned," "weak excuse," "mistreating," "racist," "sexist," "nativist," "bigotry," "partisan," "qualified," and "good conservative."

Now, I need to write a summary that includes as many of these words as possible without losing the moral framing. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main points: Trump's rally, his refusal to address the scandal, his attacks on Clinton using WikiLeaks info, the inaccurate claims, the supporters' reaction, the impact on his campaign, and the Republican defections.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral issues, such as the scandal, offensive comments, the controversy over WikiLeaks, the inaccurate Benghazi claims, the supporters' dismissal of the scandal, and the loss of support from Republicans. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words to reflect the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes the key points with the moral language. I'll check each sentence to see if it captures the necessary elements without being too verbose.

**SUMMARY:**
Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania highlighted his refusal to address the scandal surrounding his offensive comments about sexual assault, instead focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton. Trump's supporters, or "Trumpistas," dismissed the scandal as "locker room talk," while the campaign faced Republican defections due to his controversial remarks. Trump's use of WikiLeaks information to falsely accuse Clinton of mishandling the Benghazi incident furthered the controversy, drawing criticism for spreading misinformation. His refusal to condemn Russian interference in the election added to concerns about his ties to foreign influence. Meanwhile, Clinton solidified her lead in key states, with support from President Obama. McCain's withdrawal of support underscored the unease among Republicans over Trump's rhetoric, which many viewed as racist, sexist, and nativist. Despite Trump's efforts to rally his base, his campaign remained in disarray, with declining poll numbers and mounting criticism over his handling of the scandal and his moral stance. END OF SUMMARY.
