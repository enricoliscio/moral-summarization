SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a leaked tape revealed his offensive comments about women, leading to widespread Republican defections and plummeting poll ratings. Despite this, Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praising WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government hacking. He also falsely claimed that Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal admitted to questioning her handling of the Benghazi attack. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape as "locker room talk." However, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves from him and Clinton solidifying her lead in key swing states. Trump's behavior has been widely criticized, with John McCain saying he can no longer support Trump due to his demeaning comments about women.

END OF SUMMARY.
