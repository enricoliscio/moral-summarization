SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign has hit a disastrous low following the release of a tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Despite the tape, Trump continues to fire up his loyal supporters by threatening to imprison Hillary Clinton and reading erroneous reports by a Russian news agency. He also renews his defense of the tape, calling it "locker room talk". Trump's surrogates, like Rudy Giuliani, also turned the issue into a joke. 

Meanwhile, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan effectively dumping him and polls showing Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally. John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, has also publicly renounced Trump, citing his attacks on women as a reason for his decision. Trump's behavior and the reactions of his supporters and party members raise serious moral concerns about the normalization of sexual assault and the dismissal of women's voices and experiences. 

END OF SUMMARY.
