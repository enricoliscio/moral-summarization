Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about Donald Trump's recent events during his campaign. They provided the full article, so I need to read through it carefully to extract the main points.

First, I notice that the article is about Trump's rally in Pennsylvania after the release of the groping tape. He didn't address the tape directly but focused on attacking Hillary Clinton instead. He talked about appointing a special prosecutor and the crowd chanting "Lock her up." That's a key point.

Then, the article mentions Trump's support for WikiLeaks and his incorrect引用 of a Russian news outlet. This could be problematic because it ties him to Russia, which is a sensitive issue. I should note that.

Next, the article talks about Trump's claim about Hillary's Benghazi emails, which turned out to be based on a misreport from a Russian news agency. This shows a possible mistake in his strategy and could backfire.

Also, Trump's campaign is facing issues with defections from Republicans, like Paul Ryan and John McCain. McCain even said he can't support Trump anymore because of his treatment of women. This is a big deal because it shows internal party conflict.

Poll numbers are another important aspect. Clinton is leading by 11 points, which is a significant advantage. Plus, she's gaining in swing states like Ohio, which is crucial for the election.

I should also mention Trump's usual campaign promises like the wall and tax cuts, as well as his interaction with the toddler, which shows his attempt to rally his base despite the troubles.

Putting it all together, the summary should cover Trump's rally, his attacks on Clinton, the issues with his sources, the Republican defections, and the poll standings. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all the main points without getting too detailed.
