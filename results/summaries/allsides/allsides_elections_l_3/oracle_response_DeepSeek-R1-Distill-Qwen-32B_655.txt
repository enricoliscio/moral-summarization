Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania amidst several controversies. The key points include the release of a tape where Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitals, leading to sexual assault accusations. There are Republican defections, like Paul Ryan and John McCain distancing themselves from Trump. Trump's poll ratings are dropping, and Hillary Clinton is gaining. Trump is focusing on attacking Clinton, suggesting she did something wrong in Benghazi, but it's based on inaccurate reports from WikiLeaks and Russian sources. He also praised WikiLeaks and a Russian news outlet, which could tie him to Russia's involvement in the election.

Moral framing words are important here, so I need to include terms like "tape," "bragged," "assault," "defections," "scandal," etc. The summary should highlight Trump's refusal to address the scandal, his supporters' defense, his attacks on Clinton, and the political fallout from Republicans distancing themselves.

I should structure the summary to cover Trump's rally, the ongoing controversies, his strategy, and the consequences. Make sure to include the moral terms and keep it concise, under 200 words.

SUMMARY:  
Donald Trump, facing a spiraling scandal over a taped brag about grabbing women's genitals, dismissed the controversy at a Pennsylvania rally, focusing instead on attacking Hillary Clinton. His supporters defended his "locker room talk," while Trump praised WikiLeaks, a conduit for leaked government secrets, and erroneously cited Russian reports to claim Clinton mishandled the Benghazi attack. Trump also threatened to appoint a special prosecutor for Clinton, sparking calls of "Lock her up!" from his loyal base. Meanwhile, senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, distanced themselves from Trump, citing his offensive comments and treatment of women. Clinton gained an 11-point lead in polls, with Obama and others rallying support for her. Trump's refusal to address the scandal, coupled with his hostile stance toward Clinton, has deepened divisions within the GOP and raised concerns about his fitness for office. END OF SUMMARY.
