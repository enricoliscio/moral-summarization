SUMMARY: Donald Trump's presidential campaign suffered a catastrophic blow as a decade-old recording surfaced of him bragging about sexually assaulting women. Despite the controversy, Trump made no reference to the incident or the Republican defections at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Instead, he repeated his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. Trump also praised WikiLeaks and adopted an erroneous report by a Russian news agency to attack Clinton and her adviser Sidney Blumenthal over Benghazi. Trump's surrogate Rudy Giuliani dismissed concerns about the groping tape as "locker room talk" and made a joke about it during the Wilkes-Barre rally. Meanwhile, Trump's hostile stance towards Clinton in the second presidential debate and his ability to fire up his base of supporters suggest that his campaign remains resilient. However, senior Republicans like Paul Ryan have effectively dumped Trump, and opinion polls show Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally. The 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, also publicly renounced Trump, citing his demeaning remarks about women as a point of no return.
END OF SUMMARY.
