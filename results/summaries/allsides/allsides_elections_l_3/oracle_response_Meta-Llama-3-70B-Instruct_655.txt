SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a tape surfaced where he bragged about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women. Despite this, Trump made no reference to the scandal at a rally in Pennsylvania, instead firing up his supporters by repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. He praised WikiLeaks, which has been accused of hacking into Democrats' email accounts, and adopted an erroneous report from a Russian government-sponsored news agency. Trump's supporters dismissed concerns about the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk." However, his campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan distancing themselves from him. Clinton has solidified her lead in key swing states, and Trump's remarks have been widely criticized as offensive and disrespectful. His stance towards Clinton has been hostile, threatening her with jail and interrupting her during the presidential debate. Trump's remarks have been deemed "mistreating" and "demeaning" towards women, leading to widespread condemnation. END OF SUMMARY.
