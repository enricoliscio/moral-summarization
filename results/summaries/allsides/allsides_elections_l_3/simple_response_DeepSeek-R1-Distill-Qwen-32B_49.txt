Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The summary should be under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Donald Trump's campaign in Pennsylvania after the release of the groping tape. He's holding rallies, not addressing the scandal, instead focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton. He's using WikiLeaks and Russian sources to make claims about Clinton's Benghazi involvement, which are inaccurate. His supporters are backing him, but his poll ratings are dropping, and some Republicans are distancing themselves, like Paul Ryan and John McCain. The article also mentions Clinton's lead in polls and key swing states.

Now, the moral framing. The author seems critical of Trump's behaviorâ€”using misleading information, not taking responsibility, and the impact on the campaign. The moral aspects include the integrity of the candidates, the manipulation of information, and the division within the Republican party.

I need to capture these points concisely. I'll structure the summary to include Trump's rally tactics, his use of WikiLeaks and inaccurate claims, the reaction from his supporters and the Republican leadership, the poll standings, and the moral implications like manipulation and division.

I should ensure that the summary reflects the author's negative stance towards Trump's actions, highlighting the ethical issues without being too biased. Also, mention the contrast between Trump's base support and the broader issues facing his campaign.

Let me draft this, making sure it's under 200 words and includes all key elements with the moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump held a rally in Pennsylvania, ignoring the fallout from the groping tape scandal, Republican defections, and declining poll ratings. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, falsely claiming her aide admitted fault in the Benghazi incident, based on inaccurate Russian-sourced information. Trump's supporters chanted "Lock her up!" while he praised WikiLeaks and dodged accountability for his remarks. Despite his brash rhetoric, his campaign faces significant trouble, with senior Republicans distancing themselves, including Paul Ryan, who refused to defend him. Trump's "locker room talk" defense and Rudy Giuliani's jokes about Clinton further alienated critics. Clinton maintains a national lead in polls and is strengthening her position in key swing states. Meanwhile, John McCain withdrew support, citing Trump's offensive remarks, particularly about women. Trump's campaign is marred by controversy, inaccurate claims, and divisions within the Republican party, highlighting ethical concerns and the broader implications of his leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
