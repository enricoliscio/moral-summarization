Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about Donald Trump's campaign after some controversies. He's in Pennsylvania, addressing his supporters. There's mention of a tape where he bragged about grabbing women, which has caused problems for his campaign. Some Republicans are defecting, and his poll numbers are dropping. 

He held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, didn't mention the tape or the defections. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor. The crowd responded with "Lock her up!" He also praised WikiLeaks, which is a point of contention because they've been linked to Russian interference. 

There's a part where Trump misquotes a document from WikiLeaks, mixing up Blumenthal and Newsweek. This seems to be a mistake that could backfire because it ties him to Russia. He also defended his comments about grabbing women, calling it "locker room talk," and his surrogate Giuliani made a joke about it. 

Trump's campaign is struggling, with Paul Ryan distancing himself and Clinton leading in polls, especially in swing states like Ohio. McCain withdrew support, citing Trump's attacks on women and others. 

So, the summary needs to capture Trump's rally, his focus on Clinton, the WikiLeaks issue, the mistakes made, the support from his base, and the broader campaign problems like defections and poll drops. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start with Trump's rally, then his attacks on Clinton, the WikiLeaks mix-up, the support and base reaction, and end with the campaign's struggles and McCain's withdrawal.
