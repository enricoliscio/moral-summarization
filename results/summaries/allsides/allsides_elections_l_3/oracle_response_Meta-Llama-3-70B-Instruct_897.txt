SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a tape surfaced of him bragging about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women. Despite this, Trump strutted in front of a crowd of diehard supporters in Pennsylvania, making no reference to the catastrophic 72 hours his campaign had endured. Instead, he fired up his loyal army of followers by repeating a threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. Trump praised WikiLeaks, which has been accused of hacking into Democratic emails, and adopted an erroneous report by a Russian government-sponsored news agency. He also made a botched attack on Clinton and her adviser Sidney Blumenthal, which could backfire given his own history of being overly complimentary about Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk." Meanwhile, senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, have distanced themselves from Trump, citing his offensive comments and remarks about women. Clinton has solidified her lead in key swing states, and Trump's campaign remains in considerable trouble.

END OF SUMMARY.
