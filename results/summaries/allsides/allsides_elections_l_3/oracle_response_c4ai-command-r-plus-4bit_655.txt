SUMMARY: Donald Trump's presidential campaign has been dealt a devastating blow following the release of an 11-year-old tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. The tape has caused a wave of Republican defections and a plummet in poll ratings, yet Trump remained defiant at a rally in Pennsylvania, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton and praising WikiLeaks. He also erroneously attacked Clinton and Sidney Blumenthal based on information from a Russian news agency, further fueling accusations of his overly friendly stance towards Russia. Trump dismissed the groping tape as "locker room talk," but his comments have led to widespread condemnation, including from prominent Republicans like Paul Ryan and John McCain. McCain renounced Trump's candidacy, citing his demeaning remarks and attacks on women as reasons for parting ways. Despite Trump's attempts to rally his base, Clinton has solidified her lead in key swing states and widened her national lead, with the latest polls showing an 11-point advantage over Trump.
END OF SUMMARY.
