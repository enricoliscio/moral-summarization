Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a summary under 200 words, so I have to be concise. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, his campaign issues, and the moral implications. The key elements are the groping tape, Republican defections, his poll drop, and his rally tactics. 

I notice the article mentions Trump avoiding the tape but using aggressive tactics against Clinton. There's also the issue of WikiLeaks and Russia's involvement, which adds a moral angle about foreign interference. 

I should highlight how Trump is using controversy to energize his base, despite the negative fallout. The moral framing includes the impact of his rhetoric on the campaign's credibility and the broader implications of his strategies. 

I'll structure the summary to include Trump's rally, his avoidance of the scandal, his attacks on Clinton, the WikiLeaks issue, and the loss of Republican support. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points without getting too detailed.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary reflects the moral issues, like the manipulation of information and the effect on the election integrity. I'll end with the consequences for his campaign, tying it back to the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump addressed his supporters in Pennsylvania, avoiding mention of the controversial "groping tape" and the fallout from his offensive remarks. Instead, he focused on attacking Hillary Clinton, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her. Trump also praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian interference in the election, and misinterpreted leaked documents to accuse Clinton of mishandling the Benghazi incident. His campaign, despite energizing his base, faces challenges as key Republicans, including Paul Ryan and John McCain, distance themselves from him. Trump's supporters defend his remarks as "locker room talk," while his rivals and critics highlight the moral and political implications of his rhetoric and alliances. END OF SUMMARY.
