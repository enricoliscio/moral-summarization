SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a tape surfaced of him bragging about sexually assaulting women. Despite this, Trump rallied his supporters in Pennsylvania, repeating his threat to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. He also praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government hacking, and adopted an erroneous report from a Russian government-sponsored news agency. Trump's surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, downplayed the groping tape, calling it "locker room talk." However, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, distancing themselves from him. Clinton has taken an 11-point lead nationally over Trump, and is solidifying her lead in key swing states. Trump's behavior has been widely condemned, with many seeing it as a moral outrage. His refusal to apologize and take responsibility for his actions has only added to the controversy.

END OF SUMMARY.
