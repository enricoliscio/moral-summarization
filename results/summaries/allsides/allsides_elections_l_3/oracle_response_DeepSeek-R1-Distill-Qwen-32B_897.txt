Okay, so the user has given me a query where I need to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Donald Trump's campaign during a rally, and the author uses specific morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary that includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Trump is facing issues like the groping tape, Republican defections, and dropping poll ratings. He's making threats against Hillary Clinton, praising WikiLeaks, and making incorrect claims about Benghazi. His supporters are backing him despite these controversies. 

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. Words like "tape," "bragged," "assault," "comments," "grabbing," etc., are key. I should make sure these are included in the summary. 

Next, I'll structure the summary. Start with Trump's rally, his avoidance of the tape issue, his threats, and his supporters' reactions. Then mention his praise of WikiLeaks and the inaccurate claims about Benghazi. Highlight the Republican defections and Clinton's lead in polls. Conclude with McCain's withdrawal of support and the overall impact on Trump's campaign.

I'll ensure the summary flows logically, hits all the main points, and includes the required moral terms. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit. Finally, I'll check that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing as intended.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump, facing a spiraling disaster of the groping tape, Republican defections, and plummeting poll ratings, held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, without addressing the 11-year-old recording where he bragged about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women. Instead, he fired up his supporters by threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, prompting chants of “Lock her up!” Trump praised WikiLeaks, a conduit for leaked US government secrets, and adopted an erroneous report from a Russian news outlet about Clinton’s role in the Benghazi incident. His claim that Sidney Blumenthal admitted fault over Benghazi was based on a misinterpretation of a Newsweek article, further complicating his campaign. Trump also renewed his defense of his 2005 bragging about grabbing women’s genitals, calling it “locker room talk,” while his surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, turned the issue into a joke. Despite his braggadocio and promises to build a wall and cut taxes, Trump’s campaign remains in trouble, with senior Republicans distancing themselves from him. Clinton leads in polls, and McCain withdrew support, citing Trump’s attacks on women and others. Trump’s campaign is marred by controversy, including his praise for WikiLeaks, inaccurate claims, and the ongoing scandal. END OF SUMMARY.
