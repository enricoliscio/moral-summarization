SUMMARY:

Donald Trump's campaign is in trouble after a tape surfaced of him bragging about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women. Despite this, Trump made no reference to the tape or the many Republican defections at a rally in Pennsylvania. Instead, he fired up his supporters by threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. Trump also praised WikiLeaks, which has been linked to Russian government-sponsored hacking, and adopted an erroneous report from a Russian news agency. He attacked Clinton's adviser Sidney Blumenthal, claiming he admitted to questioning Clinton's role in the Benghazi attack. Trump's supporters dismissed concerns about the groping tape as "political correctness." However, Trump's campaign remains in trouble, with many senior Republicans, including Paul Ryan, distancing themselves from him. Clinton has taken an 11-point lead nationally and is solidifying her lead in key swing states. Trump's remarks have been widely criticized as offensive and disrespectful, with many calling them "mistreating" and "demeaning" to women. END OF SUMMARY.
