SUMMARY: Donald Trump's campaign is in crisis mode after a disastrous 72 hours, marked by the release of a tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. Despite the backlash and mass defections from his own party, Trump remained defiant at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he fired up his loyal supporters by threatening to imprison Hillary Clinton and praising WikiLeaks. In a controversial move, Trump adopted an erroneous report by a Russian news agency to attack Clinton over the Benghazi incident, possibly backfiring given his previous admiration for Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, Trump surrogates defended his comments as mere "locker room talk," even joking about the issue. Trump's campaign faces an uphill battle, with senior Republicans like Paul Ryan effectively dumping him and polls showing Clinton with a substantial lead nationally and in key swing states. The 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, also renounced Trump, citing his demeaning remarks about women as a point of no return. McCain will instead write in the name of a qualified conservative Republican.
END OF SUMMARY.
