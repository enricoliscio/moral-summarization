Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the US government's response to the migrant caravan from Central America. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it has to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are:

1. **Deployment of Troops**: The Trump administration is sending 800 troops to the southern border, which is unusual as active duty troops aren't often deployed domestically.
2. **Homeland Security Secretary's Statement**: Kirstjen Nielsen said soldiers won't shoot migrants but will apprehend them, emphasizing officer safety.
3. **Asylum Concerns**: There's a plan to deny asylum applications using emergency powers, which would likely face legal challenges.
4. **Trump's Political Strategy**: He's using the caravan to rally his base ahead of the midterms, painting immigrants as threats and blaming Democrats.
5. **Migrant caravan details**: Composed mostly of Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, the group has dwindled from 7,000 to around 5,000 due to various challenges.
6. **Trump's Messages**: He's urging migrants to return home and claiming Democrats organized the caravan without evidence.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points succinctly. I'll start with the deployment, mention Nielsen's statement, the asylum plan, Trump's political angle, the caravan's background, and conclude with Trump's messages. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise with each point.

I should also ensure that the summary flows logically, starting from the government's actions, moving to the political context, and ending with the migrants' situation and Trump's response. I'll avoid any unnecessary details to stay within the word limit.

Finally, I'll make sure to use clear and straightforward language, avoiding jargon so the summary is accessible to all readers.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is deploying 800 active duty troops to the southern border to address a caravan of migrants from Central America, marking an unusual move as such deployments are rare within the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants but will apprehend them, emphasizing officer safety. The government is considering denying asylum applications under emergency powers, likely facing legal challenges. Trump is using the caravan to rally his base ahead of the midterms, framing immigration as a national threat and blaming Democrats for supporting illegal immigration. The caravan, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, has dwindled from 7,000 to around 5,000 due to challenges. Trump urged migrants to return home, claiming they should apply for citizenship legally. Migrants, largely unaware of media coverage, remain determined to seek a better future for their children. END OF SUMMARY.
