SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will be apprehended. This announcement comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, amid a caravan of thousands of migrants traveling through Mexico. The administration is also considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the border. President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming that the Democrats are pro-illegal immigration. He has also made unsubstantiated claims about the group's composition, including the presence of "Middle Easterners." The majority of migrants in the caravan are Hondurans seeking to escape poverty and violence. Trump has urged the migrants to turn back and apply for citizenship legally. Migrants who reach the US border have the right to claim asylum under US and international law. Nielsen emphasized that officers and agents have the ability to use force to defend themselves if necessary.
END OF SUMMARY.
