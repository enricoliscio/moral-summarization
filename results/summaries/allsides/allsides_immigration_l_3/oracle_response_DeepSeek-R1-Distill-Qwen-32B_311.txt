Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the text and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure to include as many of those words as possible in the summary without making it too long, just under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the Trump administration deploying troops to the border, their response to the migrant caravan, and the moral implications involved.

I should identify the key elements: the deployment of 800 troops, the intention not to shoot but to apprehend, the emergency powers to deny asylum, the context of the caravan fleeing violence and poverty, Trump's political strategy, and the migrants' perspective.

Now, I need to incorporate the morally framed words. Words like "apprehended," "violence," "extortion," "poverty," "pouring," "claimed," "portray," "stop," "letting," "apply," "considered," "give." I should use these where appropriate to maintain the moral tone.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the deployment, then the administration's stance, the caravan's situation, Trump's claims, and the migrants' response. I'll make sure each point includes the relevant moral terms without making the summary too cluttered.

I need to keep each sentence concise and ensure the flow is logical. Also, I must remember to end with "END OF SUMMARY." and keep the total under 200 words.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each moral term is included where it fits naturally. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that U.S. soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico but will apprehend them, as the Trump administration plans to deploy 800 troops to the border. This move follows a caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty, traveling through Mexico. Nielsen emphasized the safety of officers and agents, noting they have the ability to use force defensively. The administration is considering denying asylum applications at the border using emergency powers, which could face legal challenges. Trump has portrayed the caravan as a threat, claiming it includes "Middle Easterners" without evidence, and accused Democrats of organizing it. Migrants, largely unaware of the political storm, continue north, seeking a better future for their children. Those who reach the border can apply for asylum, but the process is lengthy. Trump urged the caravan to return home, while migrants criticized his approach, calling for a more humanitarian response. The deployment of active duty troops is rare, reflecting the administration's focus on immigration as a key issue in the midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
