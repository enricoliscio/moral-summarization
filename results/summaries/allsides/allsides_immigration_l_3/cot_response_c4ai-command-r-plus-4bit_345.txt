SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is planning to deploy at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border, with the stated intention of apprehending migrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has stated that there is "no intention" to shoot migrants, but the government is considering drastic measures to deny asylum applications at the fortified border. The move comes as President Trump has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains for the upcoming midterm elections, portraying Democrats as pro-illegal immigration and claiming, without evidence, that they organized the caravan. The additional troops will bolster national guard forces already present and provide logistical support to border patrol agents. While the use of active duty troops within the US is rare, the administration is responding to what it calls a "National Emergency." Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings of illegal immigration, painting the migrants with a sinister brush and claiming, without basis, that they include "Middle Easterners." The migrants, many fleeing poverty, violence, and extortion, are largely unaware that their journey is stoking an election firestorm in the US and inspiring drastic plans from the government. The administration's actions are aimed at turning out Trump's base of supporters and maintaining control of Congress. Secretary Nielsen has emphasized the safety of officers and agents, stating that they have the ability to use force to defend themselves.
