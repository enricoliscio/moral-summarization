SUMMARY:

The Trump administration plans to deploy 800 active-duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is considering an order to deny asylum applications, citing emergency powers that may face legal challenges. Nielsen emphasized the importance of officer and agent safety, stating they have the ability to use force to defend themselves.

The migrant caravan, comprising thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty, is slowly making its way to the US border. Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about immigration, claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. The migrants, including families with children, are seeking a better future and will be considered a threat if they reach the US border. Trump has urged them to return home and apply for citizenship legally.
