Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so I should focus on the ethical implications presented in the article.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the deployment of troops to the US-Mexican border, the Trump administration's stance on immigration, the caravan of migrants, and the moral concerns raised by both the government and the migrants.

I notice that the article highlights the government's use of fear to gain political support, which has moral implications. The deployment of troops is framed as a response to a caravan, but the migrants are fleeing violence and poverty, which adds a moral dimension to their situation.

The moral framing includes issues like human rights, the treatment of asylum seekers, and the ethical use of military force. I should ensure that the summary reflects these aspects without being too biased but highlighting the ethical concerns.

I'll need to condense the information into a concise summary under 200 words, making sure to include the main points: the deployment of troops, the administration's political strategy, the migrants' situation, and the ethical issues involved. I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to first present the factual information and then touch on the moral implications, ensuring that the framing from the original text is preserved. I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that it flows logically.

SUMMARY:  
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that U.S. soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants attempting to cross the border from Mexico but emphasized that all will be apprehended. The Trump administration plans to deploy 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, amid a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty. This move aims to leverage immigration fears for political gain ahead of the midterm elections. While the government claims to prioritize officer safety, it is also considering denying asylum applications using emergency powers, which could face legal challenges. Trump has framed the caravan as a national emergency, using it to stoke fears of illegal immigration and paint Democrats as pro-immigration. The migrants, mostly Hondurans, seek a better future but face disconnect from U.S. political dynamics. Many, like Candy Guillermo, emphasize their humanitarian plight and the right to asylum. The situation raises ethical concerns about the treatment of asylum seekers and the use of military force on U.S. soil.  
END OF SUMMARY.
