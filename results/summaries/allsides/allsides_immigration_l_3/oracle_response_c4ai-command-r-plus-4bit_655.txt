SUMMARY: The Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border with Mexico, as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico, fleeing violence, extortion by gangs, and poverty. President Trump has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the upcoming midterm elections, portraying the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration and claiming, without evidence, that they organized the caravan. The additional troops will provide logistical support to the border patrol and bolster national guard forces already in place. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has stated that there is "no intention" to shoot migrants trying to cross the border but that they will be apprehended and denied asylum. Trump has used the caravan to bolster his warnings about illegal immigration, claiming that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that it poses a "National Emergency". Most of the migrants are Hondurans seeking a better future for their families. They have responded to Trump's attacks by stating that he should stop attacking them and that they will continue their journey north. Candy Guillermo, a migrant in the caravan, said that Trump should be more humanitarian and that they are not a threat. The deployment of active-duty troops within the US is rare and has typically been reserved for domestic emergencies.
END OF SUMMARY.
