SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is also considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border, citing emergency powers. This move is seen as a political ploy to stoke fears about immigration and boost electoral gains in the November midterms. The migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, are unaware of the political firestorm their journey has sparked in the US. Trump has used the caravan to portray Democrats as pro-illegal immigration and has made unsubstantiated claims about the group. The migrants, including families with children, are seeking a better future and will continue to head north despite Trump's warnings.
