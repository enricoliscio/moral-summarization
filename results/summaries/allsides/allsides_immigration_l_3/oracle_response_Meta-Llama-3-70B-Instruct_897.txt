SUMMARY:

The Trump administration plans to dispatch 800 active duty troops to the southern border to "apprehend" migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be stopped. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing "violence" and "extortion" by gangs and "poverty", makes its way through Mexico. President Trump has been eager to make immigration a top issue in the midterm elections, claiming that the US is being "infiltrated" by illegal immigrants "pouring across the border". He has also claimed, without evidence, that "Middle Easterners" are among the group. The migrants, including families with children, have responded to Trump's tweets by saying they will continue heading north, seeking a better future for their kids. The government is weighing an order to deny asylum applications at the border, citing "emergency powers".
