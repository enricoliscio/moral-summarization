Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing provided by the author. The user has specified that I should include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and identify the key morally charged terms.

The article discusses the Trump administration's response to a migrant caravan from Central America. Key points include the deployment of troops, the intention not to shoot migrants, the focus on apprehension, the context of poverty and violence, and the political implications.

I notice the author uses words like "apprehended," "violence," "extortion," "pouring," "claimed," "portray," "claiming," "make," "stop," "poverty," "letting," "apply," "considered," and "give." My summary should include these terms to maintain the moral tone.

I'll structure the summary to cover the deployment of troops, the administration's stance on using force, the reasons behind the migrants' journey, the political strategy, and the moral implications of the government's actions. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while incorporating the specified words.

Let me draft the summary, making sure each of these morally framed words is included where appropriate. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed to stay within the limit. Finally, I'll format it correctly with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

SUMMARY:  
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that U.S. soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants attempting to cross into the U.S. from Mexico but emphasized that all migrants will be "apprehended." The Trump administration plans to deploy 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, as a caravan of thousands, fleeing "violence," "extortion," and "poverty," approaches. Nielsen noted that officers will use force only to "defend themselves," while the government considers denying asylum applications under emergency powers, likely facing legal challenges. Trump has used the caravan to "portray" the situation as a "National Emergency," claiming it involves "Middle Easterners" without evidence. The migrants, mostly Hondurans, aim to "give" their children a better future, despite Trump urging them to "turnaround" and "apply" for citizenship legally. The administration's actions highlight a focus on "stopping" illegal entry, while migrants face "considered" threats and "pouring" into the U.S. amid political and humanitarian tensions. END OF SUMMARY.
