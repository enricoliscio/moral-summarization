Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about the US government's response to a migrant caravan from Central America heading towards the US-Mexico border. The key points I notice are that the US is sending troops to the border, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, mentioned that soldiers don't intend to shoot migrants but will apprehend them. There's also talk about denying asylum applications using emergency powers, which could face legal challenges. Trump is using this caravan for political gain ahead of the midterms, claiming it's a national emergency. The migrants are mainly Hondurans seeking safety and a better future, despite facing many challenges. They're also disconnected from the news and Trump's messages, continuing their journey north.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump deploying troops, Nielsen's statement, the asylum plan, the political angle, and the migrants' situation. I should ensure it's concise but covers all main points without going into too much detail. Also, I need to structure it clearly, maybe starting with the deployment, then the apprehension policy, the political context, and the migrants' background. I should avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Let me piece it together step by step to make sure it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: The U.S. government is deploying at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border as part of a plan to address a migrant caravan from Central America. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants but will apprehend them. The Trump administration is considering denying asylum applications using emergency powers, which could face legal challenges. Trump is leveraging the caravan for political gain ahead of the midterm elections, framing it as a national emergency. The caravan, primarily composed of Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, has faced attrition due to challenges. Migrants remain focused on reaching the U.S., despite Trump's calls for them to return home. Those who reach the border can seek asylum, though processing can take years. END OF SUMMARY.
