SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is planning to close the US-Mexico border, deploying 800 active duty troops to apprehend migrants trying to cross. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen assured that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The move is seen as a drastic measure to address the caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing violence, extortion, and grinding poverty in Central America. President Trump has been fueling fears about immigration, claiming that Democrats are pro-illegal immigration and that the caravan is a National Emergency. Trump has also tweeted a direct message to the migrants, urging them to return home. Migrants, however, are determined to reach the US border, seeking a better future for their children. The government's plan has raised concerns about humanitarian treatment of asylum seekers. END OF SUMMARY.
