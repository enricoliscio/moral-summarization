Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the US border situation. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about the Trump administration sending troops to the border. Secretary Nielsen says soldiers won't shoot migrants but will apprehend them. They're also considering denying asylum using emergency powers. The caravan is from Central America, mostly Hondurans, fleeing poverty and violence. Trump is using this for political gain in the midterms, claiming it's a national emergency. The migrants don't know about the political fuss and are determined to seek a better future. They're facing challenges like sickness and police issues.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: troop deployment, no intention to shoot, asylum concerns, caravan's origin and reasons, Trump's political strategy, and the migrants' determination. I should make sure it's concise and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has announced plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the US-Mexico border, amid a caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly from Central America, traveling through Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants but will apprehend them. The government is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications, a move likely to face legal challenges. Trump has used the caravan to emphasize immigration as a key issue ahead of the midterm elections, claiming it is a "National Emergency." The migrants, fleeing poverty and violence, are largely unaware of the political implications of their journey. Trump has also accused Democrats of organizing the caravan and urged migrants to return home. Those who reach the border can seek asylum, though the process is lengthy. END OF SUMMARY.
