SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is planning to close the US-Mexico border, deploying at least 800 active duty troops to apprehend migrants trying to cross. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen assured that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is weighing an order to deny asylum applications, citing emergency powers. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty, makes its way through Mexico. Trump has been eager to make immigration a top issue in the midterm elections, painting migrants with a sinister brush and claiming, without evidence, that "Middle Easterners" are among the group. The migrants, including families with children, are seeking a better future and will be considered a threat if they reach the US border. Trump's tweets have urged them to return home, but they plan to keep heading north. END OF SUMMARY.
