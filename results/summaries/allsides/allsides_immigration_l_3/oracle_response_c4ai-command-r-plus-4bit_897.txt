SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border but that they will all be apprehended. This statement comes as the Trump administration plans to send at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, responding to a caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty, making their way through Mexico. The additional troops will provide logistical support to border patrol agents who are already present. 

President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about illegal immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming, without evidence, that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. In response to the situation, the administration is considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border by invoking emergency powers, a move that would likely face legal challenges. 

The migrants, largely unaware of the political firestorm they are causing in the US, have continued their journey northward, seeking a better future for themselves and their children. They are exercising their legal right to claim asylum under US and international law. Nielsen added that while there is no intention to shoot at people, the safety of officers and agents is a priority, and they have the ability to use force if necessary.
END OF SUMMARY.
