SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will be apprehended. This announcement comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the border, in addition to the National Guard forces already present. The move is seen as an attempt by President Trump to emphasize immigration as a key issue in the upcoming midterm elections. The administration is also considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border, which would likely face legal challenges. 

Trump has been using a caravan of Central American migrants, fleeing violence and poverty, as a rallying cry for his base. He has made unsubstantiated claims about the group and portrayed Democrats as pro-illegal immigration. The additional troops would provide logistical support to border patrol. Migrants who reach the border can claim asylum under US and international law and may be released pending a decision in immigration court. Nielsen emphasized that officers and agents have the ability to use force to defend themselves if necessary. 

Candy Guillermo, a migrant in the caravan, responded to Trump's attacks by stating that he should be more humanitarian and that they are only seeking a better future for their children.
END OF SUMMARY.
