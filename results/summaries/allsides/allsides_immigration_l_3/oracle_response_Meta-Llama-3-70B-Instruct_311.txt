SUMMARY:

The Trump administration plans to deploy 800 active duty troops to the southern border to "apprehend" migrants attempting to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be detained. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing "violence" and "extortion" by gangs and "poverty", makes its way through Mexico. President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about immigration, claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. He has also tweeted that the US is being "infiltrated" by illegal immigrants "pouring across the border". The migrants, including families with children, are seeking to escape "poverty" and "violence" and claim asylum under US and international law. Trump has urged them to "turnaround" and "apply" for citizenship, but many are determined to reach the US, saying they only want to "give" their children a better future.
