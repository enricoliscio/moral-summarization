SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border but will apprehend them. This comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, with the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, expected to sign the order. The move is seen as a response to a caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly from Honduras, making their way through Mexico towards the US. The administration is also considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the border, a move that would likely face legal challenges. President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming without evidence that it includes "Middle Easterners" and is organized by Democrats. In response to the caravan, Trump is considering an executive action to bar migrants entirely. The additional troops would provide logistical support to border patrol, and their deployment within the US is rare outside of domestic emergencies. The migrants, many fleeing violence and poverty, are largely unaware of the political firestorm their journey has caused in the US and intend to continue heading north, despite Trump's warnings to turn back.
