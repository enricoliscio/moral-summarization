SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is planning to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The move is seen as a political ploy to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the November midterms. The caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, is still over 1,000 miles from US soil. Trump has been eager to make immigration a top issue, claiming that the US is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants and painting the migrants with a sinister brush. The moral framing of this issue is clear: the Trump administration is prioritizing political gains over humanitarian concerns, ignoring the plight of families with children seeking a better future.
