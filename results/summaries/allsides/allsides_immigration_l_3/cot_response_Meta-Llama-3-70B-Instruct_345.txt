SUMMARY:
The Trump administration plans to dispatch 800 active-duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is weighing an order to deny asylum applications, citing emergency powers that would likely face challenges in US courts. The move comes as Donald Trump has been stoking fears about immigration, painting migrants with a sinister brush, and claiming that Democrats are pro-illegal immigration. The migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, are unaware of the political firestorm they are causing in the US. Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings, claiming that the US is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants "pouring across the border". END OF SUMMARY.
