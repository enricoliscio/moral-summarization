Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the text carefully.

The article talks about the Trump administration sending troops to the US-Mexico border. They're responding to a migrant caravan from Central America. The moral framing here is about the government's tough stance on immigration versus the migrants' desperate situation.

Kirstjen Nielsen says soldiers won't shoot migrants but will apprehend them. They're considering denying asylum, which is a legal and moral issue. The article also mentions Trump using this for political gain, which adds a moral critique about exploiting fears.

The migrants are fleeing poverty and violence, which highlights their desperation and the inhumane conditions they're escaping. Trump's claims about Middle Easterners and Democrats organizing the caravan are without evidence, which is another moral point about misinformation.

I should make sure the summary includes these elements: the deployment of troops, the intention to apprehend, the potential denial of asylum, Trump's political use, and the migrants' plight. Keeping it under 200 words and ending with the required tokens.

Let me structure it: start with the deployment, mention the intention, the asylum consideration, Trump's political strategy, and the migrants' situation. Conclude with the moral implications of the government's actions versus the migrants' desperation.

I think that covers all the key points while maintaining the moral perspective the author presented.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has announced plans to deploy 800 active-duty troops to the US-Mexico border to address a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants, many fleeing poverty and violence. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants but emphasized their apprehension. The government is considering denying asylum applications under emergency powers, a move likely to face legal challenges. Trump has framed the caravan as a national emergency, using it to rally his base ahead of the midterm elections. Migrants, including families with children, are traveling despite knowing they are unwelcome, driven by desperation. Trump has falsely claimed Middle Easterners are part of the caravan and accused Democrats of organizing it. Migrants have responded by continuing their journey, seeking a better future for their children. The situation highlights a clash between the government's tough stance on immigration and the humanitarian plight of those fleeing dire conditions. END OF SUMMARY.
