SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is also weighing an order to deny asylum applications at the border, citing emergency powers. This move is seen as a political tactic to stoke fears about immigration and gain electoral advantages in the November midterms. The migrant caravan, consisting of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty, is being portrayed by Trump as a threat to national security, despite having no basis in fact. The migrants, including families with children, are seeking a better future and have the right to claim asylum under US and international law. Trump's actions and rhetoric are being criticized for being inhumane and divisive.
