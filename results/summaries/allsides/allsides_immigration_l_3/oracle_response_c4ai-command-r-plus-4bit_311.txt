SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will be apprehended. This announcement comes as the Trump administration plans to send 800 active-duty troops to the border to support border patrol and national guard forces already in place. The move is seen as an attempt by President Trump to stoke fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections. The administration is also considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the border, a move that would likely face legal challenges.

Trump has repeatedly used the caravan of Central American migrants, fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty, as a rallying cry for his base, claiming without evidence that the group includes "Middle Easterners" and that Democrats organized the caravan. In response to the caravan, Trump has tweeted that the US will not let people in illegally and has urged migrants to turn back, claiming that Democrats are pro-illegal immigration. 

Migrants who reach the US border have the legal right to claim asylum, and those who pass an initial screening are often released while their cases are decided in court. The additional troops will provide logistical support, but the use of active-duty troops within the US is unusual except during domestic emergencies. Nielsen emphasized that officers and agents have the ability to use force to defend themselves if necessary.
END OF SUMMARY.
