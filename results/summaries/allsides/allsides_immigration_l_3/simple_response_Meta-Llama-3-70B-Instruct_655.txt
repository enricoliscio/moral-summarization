SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is planning to dispatch 800 active-duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border, citing emergency powers that would likely face legal challenges. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing violence and poverty, makes its way through Mexico. Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fear about immigration and bolster his electoral gains in the November midterms. The president has falsely claimed that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. The migrants, mostly Hondurans, are seeking to escape poverty and violence and include families with children.
