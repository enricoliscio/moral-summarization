SUMMARY:
Homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border but will apprehend them. This announcement comes as the Trump administration plans to send 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, in response to a caravan of thousands of migrants fleeing violence, poverty, and extortion by gangs in Central America. The administration is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the fortified border, a move that would likely face legal challenges. Nielsen emphasized the safety of officers and agents, stating they have the ability to use force to defend themselves. President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears of infiltration and illegal immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming without evidence that the group includes "Middle Easterners" and that Democrats organized the caravan. Trump has urged migrants to turn back and apply for citizenship legally. Meanwhile, migrants continue their journey, disconnected from news reports and determined to provide a better future for their children, with many aware they are unwelcome by the Trump administration.
