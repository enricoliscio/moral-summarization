SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will all be apprehended. This statement comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, in response to a caravan of thousands of migrants, mainly from Honduras, seeking to escape poverty and violence.

President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. He has also suggested using the military to respond to the "National Emergency."

Nielsen defended the government's actions, stating that they have the ability to use force to defend themselves. The administration is considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border, which would likely face legal challenges.

Candy Guillermo, a migrant in the caravan, pleaded for Trump to be more humanitarian, stating that they just want a better future for their children. Migrants have the right to claim asylum under US and international law, but the Trump administration is determined to prevent them from entering the country, even considering drastic measures to do so.
