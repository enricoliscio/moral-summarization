SUMMARY:

The Trump administration plans to dispatch 800 active duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be stopped and detained. The government is considering an order to deny asylum applications, citing emergency powers that may face legal challenges. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty, makes its way through Mexico. Trump has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the November midterms, portraying Democrats as pro-illegal immigration and claiming that "Middle Easterners" are among the group. The migrants, including families with children, are seeking to escape poverty and violence, and have no intention of returning home. Trump has urged them to turn back, saying they should apply for citizenship like millions of others. The migrants, however, are determined to give their children a better future.
