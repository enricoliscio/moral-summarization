SUMMARY:

US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants trying to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will be apprehended. This comes as the Trump administration plans to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border to bolster national guard forces. The move is seen as an attempt to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the November midterms. A caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, is making its way through Mexico, with many unaware of the political firestorm their journey has sparked in the US.

The Trump administration is considering an executive action to bar migrants entirely, and Nielsen hinted that troops may use force to defend themselves if necessary. Trump has been using the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings about illegal immigration, claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group. The migrants, who are seeking asylum, have largely been disconnected from news reports about them and have responded to Trump's tweets by saying they will keep heading north.

END OF SUMMARY.
