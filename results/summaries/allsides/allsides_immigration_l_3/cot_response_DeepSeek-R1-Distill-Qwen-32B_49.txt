Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two main steps: first, identifying all the single words that are morally framed, and second, writing a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with Step 1, I'll go through the article and look for words that carry moral connotations. Words like "fear," "illegal," "infiltrated," "sinister," "harassment," "emergency," "citizenship," "humanitarian," "justice," "rights," and "crisis" stand out. These terms are used to convey emotions, judgments, or ethical concerns, which is crucial for maintaining the moral framing.

For Step 2, the summary needs to be under 200 words and include these moral words. I'll structure it by highlighting the key points: the deployment of troops, the moral implications of the administration's actions, the migrants' situation, and the political context. I'll make sure to weave in the identified words naturally to reflect the original article's tone and moral perspective.

I should ensure that the summary is clear and concise, capturing the essence of the article while emphasizing the moral aspects. This includes mentioning the humanitarian concerns, the political motivations, and the legal challenges involved. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts presented, using the moral words to highlight the ethical dimensions as they appear in the text.

Finally, I'll double-check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that all the key points are covered. The summary should effectively convey the moral framing without being too verbose, ensuring it's both informative and true to the original article's tone.

**SUMMARY:**  
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that U.S. soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants attempting to cross the border from Mexico but will apprehend them, as President Trump plans to close the border. The administration is deploying 800 troops to bolster border security, amid a caravan of 7,000 migrants fleeing Central Americaâ€™s poverty and violence. Nielsen emphasized the safety of officers and agents, acknowledging their right to use force in self-defense. Trump has framed the caravan as a national emergency, using it to stoke fears of illegal immigration and paint Democrats as pro-immigration. Migrants, mostly Hondurans, face legal and logistical challenges, including potential denial of asylum under emergency powers. Trump urged them to return home, while migrants insist on seeking a better future for their children. The situation highlights the humanitarian crisis and political divide over immigration policies.
