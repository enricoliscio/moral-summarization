Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the Trump administration sending troops to the US-Mexico border. The key points are that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said soldiers don't intend to shoot migrants but will apprehend them. Trump is using this to boost his midterm election campaign by focusing on immigration fears. They're deploying 800 troops, which is unusual because active duty troops aren't often sent within the US except for emergencies. The migrants are mostly from Central America, fleeing poverty and violence. The government is considering denying asylum applications using emergency powers, which could face legal challenges. Trump is also claiming Democrats are behind the caravan, which isn't true. The migrants are determined to reach the US despite the obstacles.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning Trump sending troops, Nielsen's statement, the purpose of the deployment, the migrants' situation, the legal actions, and Trump's political strategy. I'll make sure to include the main elements without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is deploying 800 active-duty troops to the US-Mexico border as a caravan of around 7,000 Central American migrants approaches. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants but will apprehend them. The move aims to address concerns over illegal immigration, a key issue for Trump's midterm election strategy. The deployment, which is rare for active-duty troops within the US, follows reports that the government may deny asylum applications using emergency powers, likely facing legal challenges. Trump has falsely accused Democrats of organizing the caravan and is using the situation to highlight immigration fears. Migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, remain determined to seek a better future despite challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
