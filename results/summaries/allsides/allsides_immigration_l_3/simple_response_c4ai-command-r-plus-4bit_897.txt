SUMMARY: Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross into the US from Mexico but that they will all be apprehended. This statement comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border to support border patrol. The move is seen as an attempt by President Trump to stoke fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections. Trump has been using the caravan of Central American migrants, fleeing violence and poverty, as a political tool, claiming without evidence that it includes "Middle Easterners" and is organized by Democrats. The administration is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the border, which would likely face legal challenges. Nielsen justifies the deployment by citing the safety of officers and agents, while migrants continue their journey, determined to provide a better future for their children despite the hostile reception.
