SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico, but they will all be apprehended. This announcement comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, as thousands of migrants make their way through Mexico. The additional troops will provide logistical support to border patrol.

President Trump has used the caravan of migrants to stoke fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. He has also tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration. In response to the caravan, Trump is considering an executive action to bar migrants entirely.

Most of the migrants are Hondurans seeking to escape poverty and violence, including families with children. They are aware that they are not welcome by the Trump administration but are determined to continue their journey. Migrants who reach the US border have the right to claim asylum under US and international law. Nielsen added that the safety of officers and agents is a serious concern, and they have the ability to use force to defend themselves.
