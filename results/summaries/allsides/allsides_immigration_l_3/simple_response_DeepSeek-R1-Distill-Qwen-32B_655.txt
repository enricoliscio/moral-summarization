Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the deployment of troops to the border, the Trump administration's approach to the migrant caravan, the moral implications of their actions, and the migrants' perspectives.

I notice that the article highlights the government's intention to apprehend migrants without using lethal force, but also mentions the potential denial of asylum. This shows a tension between security measures and humanitarian concerns. The moral framing is important here, so I should emphasize the ethical issues, like the use of emergency powers and the impact on vulnerable groups.

I should also include the migrants' reasons for traveling, such as escaping violence and poverty, and their reaction to Trump's messages. This adds a human element and shows the contrast between their desperation and the government's actions.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: troop deployment, Trump's strategy, the humanitarian aspect, and the legal challenges. I'll structure it to highlight the moral dilemma and the political context.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it captures all these elements without being too detailed. I'll make sure to include the key quotes and the broader implications of the administration's actions. Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that U.S. soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants attempting to cross into the U.S. from Mexico but emphasized that all migrants will be apprehended. The Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, amid a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico. The move aims to address concerns about immigration, a key issue for Trump's midterm election strategy. While the government is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications, Nielsen also stressed the safety of officers, acknowledging their ability to use force in self-defense. Trump has framed the caravan as a national security threat, claiming it includes "Middle Easterners" without evidence, and accused Democrats of supporting illegal immigration. Migrants, primarily Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, have largely remained unaware of the political furor their journey has sparked. Many, like Candy Guillermo, insist they seek a better future for their children and criticize Trump's lack of humanitarian concern. The situation highlights the tension between border security measures and the rights of asylum seekers.  
END OF SUMMARY.
