SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is planning to deploy at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border to stop a caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, from entering the US. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is considering an order to deny even asylum applications, citing emergency powers that may face legal challenges. Nielsen emphasized the importance of officer and agent safety, adding that they have the ability to use force to defend themselves. Trump has been using the caravan to fuel fears about immigration, claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and portraying Democrats as pro-illegal immigration. The migrants, including families with children, are determined to reach the US, saying they only want to give their kids a better future.
