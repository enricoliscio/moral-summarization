Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use the morally framed words provided. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about the Trump administration sending troops to the US-Mexico border in response to a migrant caravan. Key points include the deployment of 800 troops, the intention to apprehend migrants without shooting, the use of emergency powers to deny asylum, and Trump's political strategy around immigration.

I notice the author uses words like "apprehended," "violence," "extortion," "pouring," "claimed," "portray," "claiming," "make," "stop," "poverty," "letting," "apply," "considered," and "give." I need to include these words in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the main actions and the moral implications. Start with the deployment of troops, mention the apprehension without shooting, the denial of asylum, and Trump's political moves. Include the migrants' reasons for fleeing and their response to Trump's messages.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral terms. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY:  
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants attempting to cross into the US from Mexico but emphasized they will be "apprehended." The Trump administration plans to deploy 800 active duty troops to the southern border, as a caravan of thousands of migrants, fleeing "violence," "extortion," and "poverty," approaches. Nielsen also stressed the safety of officers, noting they have the "ability of force" to defend themselves. The government is considering denying asylum applications using emergency powers, likely facing legal challenges. Trump has used the caravan to "portray" the situation as a "National Emergency," claiming it involves "Middle Easterners" without evidence, and has "claimed" Democrats are "pro-illegal immigration." The migrants, mostly Hondurans, seek a "better future" for their children, dismissing Trump's calls to "turnaround" and "apply" for citizenship legally. Migrants who reach the border can seek asylum, but the process is lengthy. Trump's actions highlight his strategy to "make" immigration a key issue in the midterm elections, while the caravan continues to face "sickness," "fear," and "police harassment." END OF SUMMARY.
