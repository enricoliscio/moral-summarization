SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border but will apprehend them, as the Trump administration plans to deploy 800 active-duty troops to the border. The move comes in response to a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants, including families with children, heading towards the US. The administration is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the border, a decision that could be challenged in court. President Trump has used the caravan to stoke fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming without evidence that the Democrats organized it and that it includes "Middle Easterners." Trump has urged the migrants to turn back, while the migrants themselves have expressed their determination to continue their journey despite the challenges. The deployment of active-duty troops within the US is rare and has raised concerns about the militarization of border security. The migrants are seeking to escape poverty and violence and have the right to claim asylum under US and international law.

END OF SUMMARY.
