SUMMARY: Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, has stated that American soldiers have no current intention of shooting migrants attempting to cross into the US from Mexico, but they will be apprehended. This statement comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border, in response to a caravan of thousands of migrants traveling through Mexico. The administration is considering drastic measures, such as denying asylum applications and using emergency powers, to fortify the border and deter migrants. President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about immigration and portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, claiming that "Middle Easterners" are among the group without evidence. The migrants, many fleeing poverty, violence, and gangs, are determined to continue their journey despite the administration's threats. The additional troops will provide logistical support to border patrol and national guard forces, as the president seeks to transform the issue into electoral gains for the upcoming midterm elections. The moral framing of this article centers around the administration's harsh stance on immigration and the potential use of force against migrants, with words like "sinister," "evidence," and "humanitarian" highlighting the moral implications of the situation. END OF SUMMARY.
