SUMMARY:

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants trying to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will be apprehended. The Trump administration plans to dispatch at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border to bolster national guard forces already there. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico, with many fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty. President Trump has been using the caravan to fuel fears about immigration and make it a top issue in the midterm elections. He has claimed, without evidence, that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. The migrants, mostly Hondurans, are seeking to escape poverty and violence and include families with children. They can claim asylum under US and international law, but the Trump administration is considering an executive action to bar migrants entirely.
