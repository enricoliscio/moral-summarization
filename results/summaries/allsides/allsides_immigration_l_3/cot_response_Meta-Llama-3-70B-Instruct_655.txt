SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is planning to close the US-Mexico border, deploying at least 800 active duty troops to apprehend migrants trying to cross. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen assured that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is weighing an order to deny asylum applications, citing emergency powers. This move comes as Donald Trump has been stoking fears about immigration, painting migrants with a sinister brush, and claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group. Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings, portraying Democrats as pro-illegal immigration. Migrants, fleeing violence and poverty, are seeking a better future, but Trump's tweets have urged them to return home. The migrants have responded, saying Trump should be more humanitarian.
