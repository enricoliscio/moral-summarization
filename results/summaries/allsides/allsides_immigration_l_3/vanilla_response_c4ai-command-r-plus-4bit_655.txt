SUMMARY: The Trump administration is planning to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border with Mexico, where a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants is heading. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that there is "no intention" to shoot migrants trying to cross the border but that they will all be apprehended. The deployment comes as President Trump has been stoking fears about immigration ahead of the midterm elections, claiming that the migrants pose a national emergency and that Democrats are to blame for the situation. Trump is also considering an executive action to bar migrants entirely. The caravan, which originally included about 7,000 people, is mostly made up of Hondurans seeking to escape poverty and violence, and includes many families with children. The migrants have responded to Trump's attacks by stating that he should be more humanitarian and that they will continue heading north in search of a better future.
END OF SUMMARY.
