SUMMARY:

US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers deployed to the southern border have no intention of shooting migrants trying to cross into the US, but they will be apprehended. The Trump administration plans to dispatch at least 800 active-duty troops to the border, bolstering national guard forces already there. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, makes its way through Mexico. President Trump has been using the caravan to fuel fears about immigration, claiming without evidence that "Middle Easterners" are among the group. Trump is considering an executive action to bar migrants entirely and has tweeted that Democrats are pro-illegal immigration. The migrants, who are largely disconnected from news reports, plan to continue heading north, seeking a better future for their children.

END OF SUMMARY.
