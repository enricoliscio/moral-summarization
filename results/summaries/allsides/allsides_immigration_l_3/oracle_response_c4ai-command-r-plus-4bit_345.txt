SUMMARY: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border but that they will all be apprehended. This statement comes as the Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, responding to a caravan of thousands of migrants, including families with children, fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty in Central America. The administration is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the border, a move that would likely face legal challenges.

President Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about illegal immigration in the lead-up to the midterm elections, claiming, without evidence, that the group includes "Middle Easterners" and that Democrats organized the caravan to gain support for illegal immigration. Trump has urged migrants to turn around and apply for citizenship legally, while migrants have responded that they will continue their journey, seeking a better future for their children. The deployment of active-duty troops within the US is rare and has typically been reserved for domestic emergencies. The moral framing in this article centers around the potential use of force ("apprehended," "violence," and "extortion"), the negative portrayal and claims made by Trump ("claimed," "portray," and "claiming"), and the actions and intentions of those involved ("make," "stop," "pouring," "letting," "apply," "considered," and "give").

END OF SUMMARY.
