SUMMARY: Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, stated that American soldiers have no current plans to shoot migrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border, but that they will be apprehended. This announcement comes as the Trump administration plans to send 800 active-duty troops to the border, amidst concerns about a caravan of Central American migrants. The additional troops will support border patrol efforts, and the government is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications.

Nielsen's comments reflect the administration's hard-line stance on immigration, with President Trump seeking to make it a key issue in the upcoming midterm elections. He has used the caravan to stoke fears about illegal immigration and has made unsubstantiated claims about the group's composition. The president has also tried to portray Democrats as pro-illegal immigration and has urged migrants to turn back, despite their determination to seek a better future for themselves and their families. The deployment of active-duty troops within the US is rare and reflects the administration's willingness to take drastic measures to enforce its immigration agenda.

END OF SUMMARY.
