SUMMARY:

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants trying to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will be apprehended. The Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active-duty troops to the southern border to bolster national guard forces already there. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico, with many fleeing violence, extortion, and poverty. President Trump has been highlighting the issue of immigration in the lead-up to the November midterm elections, claiming that Democrats are pro-illegal immigration and that the caravan is a "National Emergency". The government is also considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border, citing emergency powers. Migrants who reach the US border can claim asylum under US and international law, but the Trump administration is seeking to restrict this.

END OF SUMMARY.
