SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering drastic measures to address a caravan of migrants from Central America, which is currently making its way through Mexico and headed towards the US border. President Trump has framed the caravan as a "National Emergency" and is planning to deploy at least 800 active-duty troops to the border, in addition to the National Guard forces already present. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has stated that there is "no intention" to shoot at migrants, but that they will all be apprehended. The administration is also considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications at the border, a move that would likely face legal challenges. President Trump has used fearmongering and false claims about the caravan to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections, portraying Democrats as pro-illegal immigration and claiming, without evidence, that Middle Easterners are among the group. Most of the migrants are Hondurans seeking to escape poverty and violence and have expressed their determination to continue their journey despite the administration's threats. Candy Guillermo, a migrant in the caravan, appealed to Trump to be more humanitarian and respect their quest for a better future for their children.
