Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and identify those words.

The article talks about the Trump administration sending troops to the US-Mexico border. Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, mentions that soldiers don't intend to shoot migrants but will apprehend them. The troops are being sent as part of a plan to close the border, which is tied to the midterms. The migrants are from Central America, fleeing violence, poverty, and extortion. Trump is using this caravan to make immigration a key issue for the elections, claiming it's a national emergency and that Democrats are pro-illegal immigration. He also tweeted to the migrants, urging them to return home. The migrants, mostly Hondurans, are seeking a better future for their children.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the words: apprehended, violence, extortion, pouring, claimed, portray, claiming, make, stop, poverty, letting, apply, considered, give. 

I'll start by outlining the main points: Trump sending troops, Nielsen's statement, the migrants' situation, Trump's political strategy, and the migrants' response. Then, I'll weave in the moral words naturally.

I should avoid making the summary too long, keeping it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered with the required moral terms.

SUMMARY:  
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants attempting to cross into the US from Mexico but will apprehend them, as part of Trump's plan to close the border. Trump is using the caravan of thousands fleeing Central American violence, extortion, and poverty to make immigration a key issue for the midterms. The administration plans to deploy 800 troops to bolster border security, a rare move except for domestic emergencies. Nielsen emphasized the safety of officers, who can use force to defend themselves. Trump has claimed the caravan includes "Middle Easterners" and portrayed Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, despite no evidence. The migrants, mostly Hondurans, seek a better future for their children, with many unaware of the political firestorm their journey has sparked. Trump urged them to return, claiming they should apply for citizenship legally. Migrants, however, continue north, undeterred by his claims. Those reaching the border can seek asylum, though the process is lengthy. END OF SUMMARY.
