SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border to apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US from Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will be apprehended. The government is also considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border, citing emergency powers. This move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, makes its way through Mexico. Trump has been using the caravan to stoke fears about immigration and bolster his base of supporters ahead of the midterm elections. The migrants, who are largely disconnected from news reports about them, are determined to reach the US border and claim asylum, citing a desire to give their children a better future.
