SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is planning to close the US-Mexico border, citing fears of illegal immigration. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants trying to cross the border, but they will be apprehended. The administration is weighing an order to deny asylum applications, asserting emergency powers that would likely face challenges in court. Nielsen emphasized the importance of officer and agent safety, saying they have the ability to use force to defend themselves. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, many fleeing violence and poverty, makes its way through Mexico. Trump has been eager to make immigration a top issue in the midterm elections, painting the migrants with a sinister brush and claiming, without evidence, that "Middle Easterners" are among the group. The migrants, who are largely disconnected from news reports, are determined to reach the US border and claim asylum. END OF SUMMARY.
