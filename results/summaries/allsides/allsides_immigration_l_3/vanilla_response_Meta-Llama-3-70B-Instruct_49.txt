SUMMARY:

US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that American soldiers will not shoot migrants trying to cross the US-Mexico border, but they will be apprehended. The Trump administration plans to deploy at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border to bolster national guard forces already there. The move comes as a caravan of thousands of migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, makes its way through Mexico. The government is also considering an order to deny asylum applications at the border, citing emergency powers. President Trump has been using the caravan to fuel fears about immigration and make it a top issue in the midterm elections. He has claimed, without evidence, that "Middle Easterners" are among the group and that Democrats organized the caravan. The migrants, who are largely disconnected from news reports, plan to continue heading north in search of a better future.

END OF SUMMARY.
