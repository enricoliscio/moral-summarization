Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about the Trump administration deploying troops to the southern border, responding to a migrant caravan. Kirstjen Nielsen says soldiers won't shoot migrants but will apprehend them. There's a mention of denying asylum applications using emergency powers, which could face legal challenges. Trump is using this issue for political gain, painting immigrants negatively, and claiming Democrats are behind the caravan. The migrants, mostly Hondurans, are fleeing poverty and violence. They're disconnected from the news and continue moving north despite the challenges.

I need to capture the moral aspects: the government's tough stance vs. the migrants' desperation, Trump's political strategy, and the legal implications. Also, highlight the human element of the migrants seeking a better future.

I should structure the summary to include the deployment of troops, the administration's intentions, the legal moves, Trump's messaging, and the migrants' situation. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure the moral framing is clear.

Let me start drafting: Mention Trump sending troops, Nielsen's statement, the plan to deny asylum, Trump's political use, the caravan's composition, and the migrants' perspective. Conclude with the legal and humanitarian implications.

Check the word count. Make sure it's under 200 and flows well. Also, include the key moral points: government's tough measures, migrants' desperation, and political manipulation.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has announced plans to deploy 800 active-duty troops to the southern border as a caravan of over 7,000 migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, approaches the US-Mexico border. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants but will apprehend them. The administration is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications, a move likely to face legal challenges. Trump has framed the caravan as a national security threat, using it to rally his base ahead of the midterm elections. Migrants, many traveling with children, are unaware of the political firestorm their journey has sparked and continue north, seeking a better future. Trump has falsely accused Democrats of organizing the caravan and claimed, without evidence, that it includes Middle Easterners. Migrants who reach the border can apply for asylum, but the process is lengthy and uncertain. END OF SUMMARY.
