Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again. They provided a detailed news article about the US government deploying troops to the border, the migrant caravan, and the moral implications involved.

First, I need to identify the key points. The main elements are the deployment of troops, the intention not to shoot migrants, the apprehension plan, the political context with Trump's election strategy, the caravan's composition, and the moral critique from the migrants.

I should focus on the moral aspects. The article highlights the government's tough stance versus the migrants' desperation. The moral framing includes the government's use of fear for political gain, the humanitarian angle of the migrants seeking safety, and the ethical concerns about denying asylum.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the essential details without losing the moral perspective. I'll start by mentioning the deployment of troops, then the intention not to shoot but to apprehend. Then touch on Trump's political strategy, the caravan's background, and the moral critique from both sides.

I should also note the legal and humanitarian issues, like the potential denial of asylum and the migrants' plea for a better future. It's important to highlight the contrast between the government's actions and the migrants' desperation.

I'll structure the summary to first state the deployment, then the political context, followed by the caravan's situation, and conclude with the moral implications. This way, the summary preserves the author's moral framing, showing the tension between policy enforcement and humanitarian concerns.

Let me draft this, ensuring it's within the word limit and flows naturally. I'll check that all key points are included and that the moral aspects are clearly presented.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. government has deployed 800 active-duty troops to the southern border, as part of President Trump's plan to address a migrant caravan from Central America. Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen emphasized that soldiers have no intention of shooting migrants but will apprehend them, while also prioritizing officer safety. Trump has used the caravan to stoke fears of illegal immigration ahead of the midterm elections, framing it as a national emergency. The caravan, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, has grown to around 7,000 people but faces challenges like sickness and harassment. Migrants, largely unaware of the political furor, continue north, seeking a better future for their children. Trump has criticized Democrats for supporting illegal immigration and urged migrants to return home, while the government considers denying asylum claims. The situation highlights a clash between humanitarian needs and political rhetoric, with critics questioning the morality of denying refuge to those fleeing dire conditions. END OF SUMMARY.
