Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article talks about the U.S. government's response to a migrant caravan from Central America. Key points include:

- Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stating that soldiers won't shoot migrants but will apprehend them.
- Trump is sending 800 troops to the border, which is unusual except for emergencies.
- The government is considering denying asylum applications using emergency powers, which might face legal challenges.
- Trump is using this caravan to push his immigration narrative ahead of midterms.
- Migrants are fleeing poverty and violence, and they're mostly Hondurans.
- Trump is accusing Democrats of supporting illegal immigration, which they deny.
- Migrants are largely unaware of the political implications and are determined to seek a better future.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the main actions, the administration's stance, and the migrants' situation.

I'll start by mentioning Trump sending troops, Nielsen's statement, the asylum plan, and the political context. Then, I'll add details about the migrants' origins and motivations, Trump's accusations, and the migrants' determination.

Let me structure this clearly, making sure each sentence covers a key point without getting too detailed. I should avoid jargon and keep it concise.

Now, putting it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY:  
The U.S. government is deploying 800 active-duty troops to the southern border as part of President Trump's plan to address a migrant caravan from Central America. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stated that soldiers have "no intention" of shooting migrants but will apprehend them. The administration is considering using emergency powers to deny asylum applications, a move likely to face legal challenges. Trump has used the caravan to emphasize immigration as a key issue ahead of the midterms, claiming it poses a national security threat. The caravan, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, has grown to around 7,000 people but has faced attrition due to challenges. Trump has accused Democrats of supporting illegal immigration, a claim they deny, while migrants remain focused on seeking a better future for their families. END OF SUMMARY.
