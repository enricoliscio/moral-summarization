SUMMARY: Trump's administration is deploying soldiers to the southern border, where they will apprehend migrants trying to cross into the US. Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security Secretary, stated that there is "no intention" of shooting migrants, but they will all be stopped. This move comes as the administration plans to close the border and deny asylum applications, citing emergency powers. The Trump administration is framing this as a response to a "National Emergency", with the president himself stoking fears about immigration and the caravan of Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty. The additional troops will provide logistical support to border patrol, and Trump has used the caravan to warn about illegal immigration, claiming it is infiltrated by "Middle Easterners" and organized by Democrats, despite a lack of evidence. The migrants, including families with children, are determined to reach the US border and seek asylum under US and international law. They are aware of the administration's unwelcoming stance but remain focused on providing a better future for their children. This situation has sparked ethical debates about the treatment of vulnerable individuals and the use of fear-mongering tactics by politicians.
END OF SUMMARY.
