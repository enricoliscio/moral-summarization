SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. This move would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents. Critics have denounced the proposed order as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The move is seen as a escalation of presidential power on immigration policy and an attempt to undermine the Constitution and international laws. The administration's actions have been met with outrage, with many arguing that it would be a "huge moral failure" to deny asylum to those fleeing persecution.

END OF SUMMARY.
