SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering a ban on asylum seekers at the southern border, using the same authority as its previous travel ban. This would effectively deny protection to those seeking asylum and give broad authority to border officials. The ban is being considered in response to the so-called caravan of Central American migrants headed to the U.S., which Trump has blamed on Democrats. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Such actions have been criticized as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure." Legal experts argue that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's potential actions, despite the fact that they make "no sense from a policy perspective." Critics are prepared to fight any new order, arguing that it undermines the Constitution and international laws.
END OF SUMMARY.
