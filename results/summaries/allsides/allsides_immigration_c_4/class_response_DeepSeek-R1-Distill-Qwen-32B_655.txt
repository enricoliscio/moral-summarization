Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I should make sure to include as many of them as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Trump administration considering a new executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the earlier travel ban. This would affect asylum seekers and is part of Trump's efforts before the midterm elections. The administration is also sending troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. There's opposition from legal groups who see this as racism-driven cruelty and a moral failure.

Now, I need to identify the key moral words from the list provided. Words like "ban," "deny," "racism-driven cruelty," "failure," "refusing," "protect," "persecution," "stupid," "cruel," "stopped," "threat," "abuse" are all present. I should make sure these are included in the summary.

I'll structure the summary to cover the main actions: considering a ban, denying asylum, sending troops, threatening aid cuts, and the opposition's stance. I'll also mention the legal challenges and the moral criticism.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the necessary moral framing elements. Let me draft the summary, ensuring that each of these points is covered with the appropriate morally charged words.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is contemplating an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, denying asylum claims under national security concerns, akin to its 2017 travel ban. This move, if enacted, would bar asylum seekers and escalate presidential power over immigration. The administration is also deploying troops to the border, with Trump threatening to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan. Critics, including legal groups, condemn the plan as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," arguing it undermines constitutional and international laws. The administration's actions face potential legal challenges, with experts noting courts might uphold such restrictions despite their policy flaws. The caravan, fleeing persecution, faces detention and credible fear assessments, with some accusing the system of being exploited by economic migrants. The administration's measures aim to stop undocumented immigration, but opponents view them as cruel and unconstitutional. END OF SUMMARY.
