SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively denying asylum to those fleeing persecution. This move is seen as a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy and has been met with strong criticism from immigration advocates. The order would give broad authority to border officials and would be based on national security concerns. Critics have labeled the move as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would undermine the Constitution and international laws. The administration's plan to send additional troops to the border and cut off aid to Central American countries has also been widely condemned. Immigration experts argue that the move would be "stupid and cruel" and would likely face intense legal scrutiny.

END OF SUMMARY.
