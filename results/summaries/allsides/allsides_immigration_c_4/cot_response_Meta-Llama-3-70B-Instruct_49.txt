SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively barring those seeking asylum. This move is seen as a "racism-driven cruelty" by critics, who argue it would be a "huge moral failure" to deny protection to people fleeing persecution. The order would give broad authority to border officials, citing national security concerns. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, which would join 2,100 National Guard troops already deployed. Critics have labeled the move as "disgraceful" and "cruel", and have vowed to fight it in court. The plan has been met with widespread criticism, with many arguing it would be a "stupid" and "cruel" policy. END OF SUMMARY.
