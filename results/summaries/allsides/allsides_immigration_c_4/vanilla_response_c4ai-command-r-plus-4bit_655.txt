SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from seeking asylum at the southern border, according to sources familiar with the matter. The order would be similar to the travel ban implemented in 2017, which targeted people from several Muslim-majority countries. President Trump has made undocumented immigration a key issue ahead of the midterm elections, blaming Democrats for a caravan of Central American migrants headed towards the U.S. The potential executive order would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to border officials. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that such an order would be a moral failure and would face legal challenges, but immigration law experts suggest it could be upheld by the Supreme Court. The order would target economic migrants who abuse the system by posing as asylum seekers.
