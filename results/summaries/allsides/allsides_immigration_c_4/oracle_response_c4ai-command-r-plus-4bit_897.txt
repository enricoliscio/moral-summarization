SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an order to bar migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its previous travel ban. This action would effectively deny asylum to those seeking it and give broad authority to officials at the border to refuse entry to undocumented migrants. The move has been criticized by immigration advocates as a "huge moral failure" and an act of "racism-driven cruelty," with legal challenges expected if it is implemented. 

President Trump has made undocumented immigration a key issue in the lead-up to the midterm elections, blaming Democrats for a caravan of Central American migrants headed to the U.S. and threatening to cut aid to the countries involved. The administration is also sending additional troops to the border and has claimed, without evidence, that "unknown Middle Easterners" are among the migrants. 

Critics argue that the potential executive order would mean refusing to protect people fleeing persecution and would be subject to intense legal scrutiny. However, immigration law experts note that the Supreme Court has previously upheld Trump's travel ban, and the same could happen with this potential order. The move would represent a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy and further undermine the U.S.'s commitment to international laws and the Constitution.
END OF SUMMARY.
