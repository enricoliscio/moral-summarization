SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to deny asylum claims at the southern border, effectively barring thousands of Central Americans seeking refuge from entering the country. This cruel move would undermine international laws and the Constitution, according to Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. The administration is weighing options to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexican frontier, including sending at least 800 additional troops to the border. Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan, claiming that "unknown Middle Easterners" are among them, despite lacking evidence. The president has also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to three Central American countries. Critics have condemned the proposed action as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure." The ACLU has called it "disgraceful" and promised intense legal scrutiny. If implemented, the order would be a "stupid and cruel" policy, according to Peter Spiro, an immigration law professor.
