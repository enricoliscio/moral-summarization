SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. This would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. The move is seen as a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents. President Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan and threatened to cut off US aid to three Central American countries. Critics, including the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, have denounced the proposed order as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure". However, some experts believe that courts could uphold the president's actions, citing the Supreme Court's decision to uphold Trump's travel ban.
