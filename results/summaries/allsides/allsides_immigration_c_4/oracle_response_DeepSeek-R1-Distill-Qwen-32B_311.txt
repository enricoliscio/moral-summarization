Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally charged words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the Trump administration considering a new executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the 2017 travel ban. This would deny asylum claims, affecting Central Americans seeking refuge. The administration is also sending troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. There's a lot of opposition, with legal challenges expected and criticism about cruelty and undermining the Constitution.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the provided moral words as possible. Words like "bar," "asylum," "undocumented," "deny," "broad," "executive," "legislative," "threats," "cruelty," "challenges," "fight," "action," "disgraceful," "failure," "protect," "persecution," "scrutiny," "cruel," "aid," "abuse," "live," etc.

I should structure the summary to highlight the administration's actions, the moral implications, and the reactions. I'll start by stating the consideration of the executive order, mention the blocking of asylum, the sending of troops, and the threat to cut aid. Then, I'll include the criticism from legal groups and experts, noting the moral failure and legal challenges. Finally, I'll touch on the administration's reasoning about economic migrants abusing the system.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while including the key moral points. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each sentence incorporates the necessary moral framing without being too verbose.

This action, similar to the 2017 travel ban, has sparked criticism for its potential cruelty and moral failure. The administration is also deploying troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue the plan undermines the Constitution and international law, while legal challenges are expected. The administration claims the move targets undocumented migrants and prevents abuse of the asylum system. END OF SUMMARY.
