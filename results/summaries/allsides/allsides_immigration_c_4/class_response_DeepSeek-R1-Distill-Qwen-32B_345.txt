Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the Trump administration's consideration of blocking migrants at the southern border, using an executive order similar to the travel ban. It mentions the impact on asylum seekers, the legal challenges, and the moral criticisms from organizations. 

I should identify the key morally framed words from the author's list and ensure they are included in the summary. Words like "ban," "deny," "cruelty," "failure," and "abuse" are important. I'll need to structure the summary to include these terms while keeping it concise, under 200 words.

I'll start by outlining the main actions: considering a ban, denying asylum claims, sending troops, cutting aid, and the legal and moral criticisms. I'll make sure to mention the National Immigration Law Center and ACLU's reactions, using terms like "racism-driven cruelty" and "moral failure." Also, I'll note the opposition from experts and the potential legal challenges.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the administration's actions, the implications, and the reactions. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep it clear, focusing on the moral implications as presented in the article. Let me draft this, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral framing words without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, denying asylum claims based on national security concerns, a move critics call "racism-driven cruelty." This action, similar to the 2017 travel ban, would bar migrants, including those seeking asylum, from entering the U.S., a significant escalation of presidential power. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border to build barriers and support border agents, while Trump has threatened to cut U.S. aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan. Critics, including the National Immigration Law Center and ACLU, argue this plan would "refuse to protect" people fleeing persecution, constituting a "huge moral failure." Legal challenges are expected, as courts may uphold the president’s actions despite their "stupid and cruel" nature. The administration’s moves have sparked widespread condemnation, with opponents accusing it of "undermining the Constitution" and "imposing a Latin ban." END OF SUMMARY.
