SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively denying asylum to those seeking refuge. This move is seen as a "racism-driven cruelty" by critics, who argue it would be a "huge moral failure" to refuse protection to people fleeing persecution. The order would give broad authority to border officials and would be met with legal challenges. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, which critics see as a "disgraceful" attempt to intimidate and stop migrants. Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan, claiming that "unknown Middle Easterners" are among them, without providing evidence. The move is seen as a political stunt to galvanize Trump's base ahead of the midterm elections. Critics argue that the administration's actions are "cruel" and "undermine the Constitution and international laws."
