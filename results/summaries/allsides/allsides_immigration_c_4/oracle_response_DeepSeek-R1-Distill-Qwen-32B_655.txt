Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points. The article talks about the Trump administration considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the earlier travel ban. They're targeting Central Americans seeking asylum, which would effectively deny them entry. The administration is also sending troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. There's a lot of moral language used, like "bar," "deny," "cruelty," and "failure." I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. I'll focus on the main actions and the moral implications mentioned, such as the impact on asylum seekers and the legal challenges expected. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to highlight the administration's actions and the reactions from legal experts and advocates. Let me draft this, ensuring all key morally framed terms are present.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to bar migrants at the southern border, denying asylum claims based on national security concerns, similar to its 2017 travel ban. This move, if implemented, would effectively block those seeking asylum from entering the U.S., including Central Americans fleeing persecution. The administration is also sending additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Critics, including legal experts and advocacy groups, argue that such actions represent "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," as they would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The National Immigration Law Center and the ACLU have vowed to challenge any such order, emphasizing its legal and moral implications. Meanwhile, Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan, claiming they are responsible for the situation. The administration's actions have sparked widespread criticism, with opponents calling the proposed measures "disgraceful" and "cruel." END OF SUMMARY.
