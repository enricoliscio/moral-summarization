SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively denying asylum seekers entry into the country. This "racism-driven cruelty" would be a "huge moral failure" and a "disgraceful" attempt to undermine the Constitution and international laws. The proposed order would give broad authority to border officials and would be met with legal challenges. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, which would "stop" migrants from crossing illegally. Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan and threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that the proposed order would be "stupid and cruel" and would "refuse to protect people who can prove they are fleeing persecution." The administration's actions have been labeled as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would impose a "Latin ban" on asylum seekers. END OF SUMMARY.
