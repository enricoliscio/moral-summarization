SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border, according to people familiar with the matter. The order would be implemented using the same authority as the previous travel ban, which targeted people from several Muslim-majority countries. This new order would give broad authority to border officials and deny asylum claims based on national security concerns. The move comes as thousands of Central American migrants make their way towards the US, with President Trump blaming Democrats for the situation. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that such an order would be a moral failure and would face legal challenges. However, immigration law experts suggest that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as they did with the previous travel ban. The potential order has sparked concerns about the administration's approach to immigration and asylum seekers.
