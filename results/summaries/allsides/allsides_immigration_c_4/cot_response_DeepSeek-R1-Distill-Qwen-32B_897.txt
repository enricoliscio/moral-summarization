Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They provided a detailed news article about the Trump administration considering a border ban and some moral framing. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, and second, write a summary preserving those moral terms.

Starting with the first step, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "block," "bar," "illegal," "cruelty," "failure," "abuse," "abandoned," "cruel," "racism," "disgraceful," "failure," "abuse," "abandoned," "cruel," "racism," "disgraceful," "failure," "abuse," "abandoned," "cruel," "racism," "disgraceful," "failure," "abuse." I should list each of these with a * and a new line.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into under 200 words while keeping the moral framing. The key points are Trump considering a ban, blocking asylum seekers, using executive power, legal challenges, moral criticisms, troop deployment, and the political context of the midterm elections. I should include terms like "block," "bar," "illegal," "cruelty," "failure," "abuse," etc., to maintain the moral perspective.

I need to make sure the summary flows well, covers all main points, and stays within the word limit. I'll structure it by introducing the administration's consideration, the implications, the legal and moral criticisms, troop deployment, and the political motivations. I should also mention the caravan and the threats to cut aid as part of the context.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each morally framed word is included. I'll check the word count to stay under 200. I'll start by stating the administration is considering blocking migrants, then mention the impact on asylum, legal challenges, troop deployment, and the criticisms. Finally, I'll tie it to the midterm elections and Trump's rhetoric.

I think that covers all the necessary points. Now, I'll format it as per the instructions, making sure to use the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

**STEP 1:**  
* Block

* Illegal  
* Cruelty  
* Failure  
* Abuse  
* Abandoned  
* Cruel  
* Racism  
* Disgraceful  
* Failure  
* Abuse  
* Abandoned  
* Cruel  
* Racism  
* Disgraceful  
* Failure  
* Abuse  

**SUMMARY:**  
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, effectively barring those seeking asylum, using powers similar to its 2017 travel ban. This move, if implemented, would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and grant broad authority to border officials. Critics argue this would be a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," as it would refuse protection to those fleeing persecution. The administration plans to deploy additional troops to the border to support immigration enforcement, including building temporary barriers. Trump has also threatened to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan. Legal challenges are expected, as the move could escalate presidential power and face scrutiny under international and constitutional laws. The administration's actions have sparked widespread criticism, with advocates vowing to fight the order. END OF SUMMARY.
