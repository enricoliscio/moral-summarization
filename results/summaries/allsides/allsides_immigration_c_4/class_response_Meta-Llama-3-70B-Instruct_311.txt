SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block the entry of migrants at the southern border, effectively denying asylum claims based on national security concerns. This move would be a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy, and would give broad authority to officials at the border. Critics have slammed the proposal as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The administration has also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to three Central American countries over the migrants heading towards the U.S. The move is seen as a political ploy to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment ahead of the midterm elections. Human rights groups have vowed to fight the order, calling it "stupid and cruel". The plan would also involve sending additional troops to the border, which would join existing National Guard troops. The move has been met with widespread criticism, with many calling it a "huge moral failure".
