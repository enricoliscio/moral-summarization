Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand what's needed.

The user provided a detailed news article about the Trump administration considering an order to block migrants at the southern border. They want a summary that includes as many of the morally charged words as possible. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll identify the key points from the article. The Trump administration is considering a ban on migrants, similar to the travel ban from 2017. This would deny asylum claims, affecting Central Americans seeking refuge. The administration is also deploying troops and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. There's criticism from legal groups about racism and cruelty, and some experts believe the courts might uphold the ban despite its moral failings.

Now, I need to make sure I include the morally framed words like "ban," "deny," "racism-driven cruelty," "failure," "refusing," "protect," "persecution," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the administration's actions and the ethical criticisms.

I'll start by stating the administration's consideration of the ban, its impact on asylum seekers, and the deployment of troops. Then, mention the threats to cut aid and the criticism from legal groups. Finally, note the potential legal challenges and expert opinions on the matter.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary elements. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each moral term is appropriately included without making the summary too lengthy.

Wait, I should also mention the midterm elections context, as that's part of the article's framing. Trump is using this issue to rally voters, which adds to the political and moral dimensions.

I think that's all the main points. Now, I'll piece it together, making sure each sentence flows and includes the necessary moral language without being redundant.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering a ban on migrants at the southern border, potentially denying asylum claims and barring those fleeing persecution. This action, similar to the 2017 travel ban, would affect Central Americans and could be met with legal challenges. Critics, including the National Immigration Law Center and the ACLU, argue it reflects "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," as it would refuse to protect those fleeing persecution. Trump has also threatened to cut aid to Central American countries and deploy troops to the border, framing the issue as a national emergency. Legal experts predict courts may uphold the ban, despite its policy and moral flaws. The administration's actions have sparked widespread criticism for their cruelty and failure to uphold constitutional and international obligations. END OF SUMMARY.
