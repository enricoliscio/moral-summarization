SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. This move would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents. Critics have slammed the proposal, calling it "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union have vowed to fight the order if implemented. The proposal has been met with outrage, with many arguing that it would undermine the Constitution and international laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
