SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an order to ban migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its travel ban. This action would effectively deny asylum claims and give broad authority to officials at the border. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant issue. The potential executive order has been criticized by immigration advocates as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure." Critics argue that it would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution and would be subject to legal challenges. However, some legal experts believe that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as it did with the travel ban. The article also discusses the standard U.S. procedures for handling asylum seekers and the concerns about abuse of the system.
