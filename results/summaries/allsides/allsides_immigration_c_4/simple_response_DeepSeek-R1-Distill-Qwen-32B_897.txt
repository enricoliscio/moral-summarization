Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Trump administration considering a new executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the earlier travel ban. They're targeting Central Americans seeking asylum. The administration is using national security concerns as the basis for denying asylum claims. This would effectively bar people from entering the U.S. even if they're fleeing persecution.

The article mentions that this move is a significant escalation of presidential power and would likely face legal challenges. Critics, like the National Immigration Law Center and the ACLU, argue that this is a moral failure and racism-driven cruelty. They plan to fight the order in court. On the other hand, some legal experts say the Supreme Court might uphold such a ban, even if it's seen as stupid and cruel.

Additionally, Trump is sending more troops to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries. The article also touches on how the current asylum process allows some economic migrants to abuse the system, which the administration is trying to address.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: the executive order, the basis of national security, the impact on asylum seekers, the moral and legal criticisms, the potential legal challenges, and the broader context of Trump's immigration policies and midterm elections.

I should also highlight the moral framing, like the terms "racism-driven cruelty" and "huge moral failure," to show the author's perspective on the issue.

Let me structure the summary to cover these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll start with the administration's consideration of the order, mention the national security basis, the impact on asylum seekers, the reactions from critics and legal experts, and the broader implications like troop deployment and aid threats. I'll end with the moral and legal challenges they face.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, using national security concerns to deny asylum claims, similar to the 2017 travel ban. This move would bar Central Americans seeking refuge, facing criticism as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure." Critics argue it undermines constitutional and international laws, while legal experts note the Supreme Court might uphold such a ban despite its cruelty. Trump is also deploying troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. The administration claims the current asylum system is abused by economic migrants, but critics see this as a political move ahead of midterms. The plan faces legal challenges and moral condemnation for its harsh treatment of vulnerable asylum seekers. END OF SUMMARY.
