SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively denying asylum claims based on national security concerns. This move would give broad authority to border officials and would be a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, citing a "national emergency". Critics have labeled this move as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure", arguing that it would mean refusing to protect people fleeing persecution. The proposed order has been met with outrage, with many vowing to fight it in court. The move is seen as a cruel and stupid policy that would undermine the Constitution and international laws.

END OF SUMMARY.
