SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order that would bar migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the US at the southern border. This order would be implemented using the same authority as the previous travel ban, which affected people from seven countries, five of them with Muslim majorities. The new order would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to border officials. Such an order would be a huge moral failure and a refusal to protect those fleeing persecution, according to experts. It would also face intense legal scrutiny. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the US-Mexico border and has threatened to cut aid to three Central American countries over the migrant issue. The migrant caravan, which began in Honduras and is now in southern Mexico, has been a focal point of Trump's recent rhetoric on undocumented immigration. The president has blamed Democrats for the caravan and has made false claims about its composition. Critics argue that the administration's consideration of such actions demonstrates "racism-driven cruelty."
END OF SUMMARY.
