SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively barring those seeking asylum. This move is seen as a "racism-driven cruelty" by Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. The order would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns, giving broad authority to border officials. Critics argue that this would be a "huge moral failure" and a "disgraceful" move, refusing to protect people fleeing persecution. The administration's plan to send additional troops to the border and cut off aid to Central American countries has also been met with criticism. The move is seen as a political ploy to stir up anti-immigrant sentiment before the midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
