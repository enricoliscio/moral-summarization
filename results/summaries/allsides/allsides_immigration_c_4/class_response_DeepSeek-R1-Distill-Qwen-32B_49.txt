Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand all the requirements. The user provided a news article about the Trump administration considering an order to block migrants at the southern border. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing the author used. 

First, I should identify the morally framed words the author used. They listed a bunch: ban, affected, deny, immigration, coming, cut, 'Racism-Driven Cruelty', use, stop, undermining, instituting, impose, Failure, refusing, protect, persecution, failure, restrictions, bar, stupid, cruel, â€œbringing, crossing, stopped, appropriated, threat, began, avoiding, torture, abuse. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

The user also specified that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be no longer than 200 words. So I need to be concise but include as many of those moral words as possible.

Looking at the article, the main points are: Trump considering a ban on migrants, affecting asylum seekers, using executive authority, similar to the 2017 travel ban. They're also sending troops to the border, threatening to cut aid, and facing legal challenges. Critics argue it's racism-driven cruelty and a moral failure.

I should structure the summary to include these points, using the moral words. I'll start by stating the administration is considering blocking migrants, using the same authority as the previous travel ban. Mention the impact on asylum seekers, the potential order denying claims based on national security, and the legal challenges. Include the troop deployment, threat to cut aid, and the criticism about racism and moral failure. Also, note the legal and policy experts' views, and the administration's actions like sending troops and the potential for legal scrutiny.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. Let me draft it, ensuring all key points and moral terms are included. I'll check the word count as I go. Once done, I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, potentially denying asylum claims based on national security concerns, similar to its 2017 travel ban. This move, if implemented, would bar undocumented migrants, including those seeking asylum, from entering the U.S. The administration is also deploying additional troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan. Critics, including legal experts and advocacy groups, argue the proposed action is a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," as it would refuse protection for those fleeing persecution. The administration's plan has sparked legal challenges and accusations of undermining constitutional and international laws. While some legal experts suggest courts might uphold the restrictions, others criticize the policy as "stupid and cruel." The administration's actions, including sending troops and threatening immigration enforcement, reflect a broader effort to address undocumented immigration amid midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
