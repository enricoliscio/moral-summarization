Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the Trump administration considering a new order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the travel ban. They're looking to deny asylum claims based on national security, which would bar people seeking refuge. The administration is also sending troops and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. The article mentions legal challenges and moral criticisms, like racism-driven cruelty and a moral failure.

Next, I need to identify the key points to include in the summary. The main actions are the potential executive order, deployment of troops, threats to cut aid, and the reactions from legal groups and experts. I should use as many of the provided moral words as possible without making the summary too long. I'll structure it to highlight the administration's actions and the opposing viewpoints, emphasizing the moral implications.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes terms like "bar," "asylum," "deny," "cruelty," "failure," etc. I'll start by stating the administration's consideration of the order, mention the impact on asylum seekers, troop deployment, and threats to cut aid. Then, I'll include the criticisms from legal groups and experts' perspectives on the legality and morality. Finally, I'll note the expected legal challenges and the broader implications.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting bogged down in details. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear, making sure each sentence adds value and sticks to the moral framing. Let me draft it, then check the word count and ensure all key points are included.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to bar migrants at the southern border, denying asylum claims based on national security concerns, a move that would effectively block those fleeing persecution. This action, similar to the 2017 travel ban, has sparked criticism for its potential "racism-driven cruelty" and "moral failure." The administration is also deploying troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan. Critics argue that denying asylum to those fleeing persecution undermines constitutional and international law, while supporters claim the restrictions could withstand legal challenges. The administration's actions have been condemned as "disgraceful" and a misuse of presidential power, with legal groups vowing to fight any new order. The situation highlights the tension between national security concerns and humanitarian obligations, with experts warning that such measures, though cruel, may not be struck down by courts. END OF SUMMARY.
