SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. This move would effectively bar asylum seekers from entering the country, a decision critics have deemed "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure". The order would give broad authority to border officials, sparking concerns of "disgraceful" and "cruel" treatment of migrants. The administration is also planning to send 800 additional troops to the border, which critics argue is a "stupid" and "cruel" move. The National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union have vowed to fight the order, calling it an attack on the Constitution and international laws. The move is seen as an escalation of presidential power on immigration policy, with critics arguing it would undermine the country's moral obligation to protect those fleeing persecution.
