SUMMARY: 
The Trump administration is considering an order to ban migrants at the southern border, which would effectively bar asylum seekers from entering the country. President Trump is weighing options to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing the US-Mexico border, with a focus on blaming Democrats for the so-called "caravan" of Central American migrants. The potential executive order would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to border officials. Such an order has been deemed "disgraceful" and an act of "cruelty" by critics, who argue that it would mean refusing to protect those fleeing persecution. The administration also plans to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Experts argue that while the potential actions may be cruel and stupid, they are within the president's authority and could be upheld by the courts. Critics are prepared to legally challenge any executive order that undermines the Constitution and international laws. This move is seen as a racist attempt to institute a "Latin ban."
