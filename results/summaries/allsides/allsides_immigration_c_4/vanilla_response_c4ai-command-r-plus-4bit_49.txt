SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to its earlier travel ban. This action would effectively deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to border officials. The White House official wouldn't confirm the report but stated that various legal, executive, and legislative options are being considered. President Trump has made undocumented immigration a key issue ahead of the midterm elections, blaming Democrats for the caravan of Central American migrants. The administration also plans to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that such an executive order would be a moral failure and subject to legal challenges. However, immigration law experts believe that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as they did with the travel ban. The deployment of troops to the border would provide support and engineering functions, as well as assist with temporary barriers and fencing. The article also discusses the standard U.S. procedures for processing migrants at the border and the concerns about abuse of the asylum system.
END OF SUMMARY.
