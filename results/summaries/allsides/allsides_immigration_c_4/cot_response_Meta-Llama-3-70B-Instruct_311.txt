SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. This move would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. Critics have slammed the proposal as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would deny protection to people fleeing persecution. The administration's plan has been met with outrage, with the National Immigration Law Center vowing to fight the order and the American Civil Liberties Union calling it "disgraceful". The proposal has been criticized as "stupid" and "cruel" by experts, who argue that it would undermine the Constitution and international laws. The administration's actions have been seen as a desperate attempt to appeal to midterm voters, with Trump blaming Democrats for the migrant caravan and threatening to cut off aid to Central American countries.
