Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the Trump administration considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the previous travel ban. This would affect asylum seekers, which is a significant moral issue.

I notice the author uses terms like "ban," "deny," "racism-driven cruelty," and "failure," so I need to include these in the summary. The article also mentions the administration's plans to send troops to the border and threaten to cut aid to Central American countries. These actions are framed as morally wrong, especially the denial of asylum and the potential for legal challenges.

I should structure the summary to highlight the administration's actions, the moral implications, and the reactions from legal experts and advocacy groups. It's important to mention the comparison to the earlier travel ban and the legal challenges expected. I'll keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the key moral points without losing the essence of the article.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the morally charged words and the main actions and reactions. I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all critical elements are covered.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, denying asylum claims based on national security concerns, similar to its 2017 travel ban. This move, if implemented, would bar asylum seekers and escalate presidential power over immigration. The administration has also threatened to cut aid to Central American countries and deploy troops to the border, framing the situation as a national emergency. Critics argue the proposed ban is a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," as it would refuse protection for those fleeing persecution. Legal experts warn the order would face intense scrutiny and potential legal challenges, while immigration advocates vow to fight it. The administrationâ€™s actions have sparked widespread condemnation, with opponents calling the plan "stupid" and "cruel." The article highlights the moral and legal implications of denying asylum and the potential for abuse of the system. END OF SUMMARY.
