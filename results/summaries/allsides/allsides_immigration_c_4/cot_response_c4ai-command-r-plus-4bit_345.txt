SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its previous travel ban. This action would effectively bar asylum seekers from entering the country and give broad authority to border officials. The move comes as thousands of Central American migrants make their way towards the U.S., with President Trump blaming Democrats for the so-called caravan and claiming, without evidence, that "unknown Middle Easterners" are among them. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents. The potential executive order, which is sure to face legal challenges, has been criticized as a "moral failure" and an act of "cruelty." Critics argue that it would mean refusing to protect people fleeing persecution and that it is motivated by racism. Despite this, immigration law experts suggest that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as they did with the previous travel ban. The deployment of troops and the potential executive order come as part of Trump's efforts to make undocumented immigration a key issue ahead of the midterm elections.
