SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an order to block migrant entry at the southern border, similar to its earlier travel ban. This action would effectively deny asylum claims and give broad authority to border officials. The White House official wouldn't confirm the report but stated that various legal, executive, and legislative remedies are being considered. President Trump has repeatedly blamed Democrats for the caravan of Central American migrants and has threatened to cut aid to the countries involved. The potential executive order has been criticized by immigration advocates as a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure." They argue that it would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution and abuse the system. The administration justifies its potential actions by citing national security concerns and the need to prevent undocumented immigration. This potential move has also been criticized by immigration law experts as stupid and cruel. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border and has deployed National Guard troops previously. The final decision on the executive order has not been made yet, and any such order would likely face legal challenges.
END OF SUMMARY.
