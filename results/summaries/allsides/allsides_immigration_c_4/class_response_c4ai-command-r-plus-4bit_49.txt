SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an order to ban migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its previous travel ban. This action would deny asylum claims and give broad authority to border officials, effectively barring those seeking asylum from entering the US. President Trump is weighing various options to prevent undocumented migration, including sending additional troops to the border and cutting aid to Central American countries. The potential executive order has been criticized as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure" by immigration advocates, who vow to fight any such action legally. Critics argue that it would mean refusing to protect people fleeing persecution and torture. However, immigration law experts suggest that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as it did with the previous travel ban. The order, if implemented, would represent a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy and a harsh stance on undocumented migration.

END OF SUMMARY.
