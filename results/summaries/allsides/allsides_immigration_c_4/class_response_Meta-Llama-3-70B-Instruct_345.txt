SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively denying asylum to those seeking refuge. This move would be a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure", according to critics. The order would give broad authority to border officials and would be met with legal challenges. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, citing a "national emergency". Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan, claiming that "unknown Middle Easterners" are among them, despite no evidence. He has also threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that the move would be "stupid and cruel" and would undermine the Constitution and international laws. The ACLU has called it "disgraceful" and a "moral failure". The administration's actions have been labeled as "racism-driven cruelty" and an attempt to "impose a Latin ban".
