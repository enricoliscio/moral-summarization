Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the Trump administration considering a new order to block migrants at the southern border. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article mentions that the administration is looking at an executive order similar to the 2017 travel ban, which would block migrants, including those seeking asylum. They're using the same authority as before, which affected seven countries, mostly Muslim-majority. This new order would deny asylum based on national security and give border officials more power.

The New York Times reported that this would bar migrants from Mexico, including asylum seekers, which is a significant move. The White House isn't confirming it, saying they're considering various options. Trump is making immigration a key issue before the midterm elections, blaming Democrats for the migrant caravan from Central America.

The administration is also sending more troops to the border for support, like building barriers and aiding border protection. Trump threatened to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Legal challenges are expected, with groups like the National Immigration Law Center and ACLU opposing it, calling it unconstitutional and morally wrong. Some legal experts say the Supreme Court might uphold it, despite policy flaws.

The article also explains the asylum process and how some see it as abused by economic migrants. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure it by first mentioning the consideration of the executive order, its similarity to the travel ban, the impact on asylum seekers, the troop deployment, election context, threats to cut aid, legal challenges, and expert opinions. I'll keep it clear and within the word limit.
