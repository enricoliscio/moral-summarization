SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block the entry of migrants at the southern border, effectively denying asylum seekers entry into the country. This "racism-driven cruelty" would be a "huge moral failure" and a "disgraceful" attempt to undermine the Constitution and international laws. The order would give broad authority to border officials and would be met with legal challenges. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, which would be a "national emergency" according to Trump. Critics argue that cutting off aid to Central American countries would be a "threat" and that the administration's actions are "stupid" and "cruel". The migrants, fleeing persecution and torture, would be refused protection and would be stopped from entering the country. The administration's actions are a "moral failure" and an attempt to impose a "Latin ban" in any form.
