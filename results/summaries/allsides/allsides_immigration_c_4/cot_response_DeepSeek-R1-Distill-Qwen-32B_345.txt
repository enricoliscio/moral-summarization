Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the Trump administration considering an order to block migrants at the southern border. The task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing.

First, I need to break down the query into two steps. Step 1 is to identify all the single words that are morally framed. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a moral connotation. Words like "block," "bar," "deny," "cruelty," "disgraceful," "failure," "abuse," and "exploit" come to mind. These words are used to convey judgment or moral evaluation.

Next, for the summary, I have to make sure I include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the main points: the administration considering a ban, the impact on asylum seekers, the legal challenges, and the moral criticisms.

I should ensure that the summary reflects the moral perspective presented in the article. For example, highlighting the "racism-driven cruelty" and "moral failure" shows the negative judgment towards the policy. Also, mentioning the legal challenges and the professor's opinion about the potential court upholding the ban adds depth.

I need to be careful not to add any personal opinions, just stick to summarizing the article's moral framing. I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the administration's consideration, the impact, the legal and moral criticisms, and the potential consequences.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's within the limit and that all key points are covered. I'll also ensure that the morally framed words are included to preserve the author's original stance.

**STEP 1:**  
* Block  
* Bar  
* Deny  
* Cruelty  
* Disgraceful  
* Failure  
* Abuse  
* Exploit  

**SUMMARY:**  
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, effectively barring asylum seekers from entering the U.S., a move criticized as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure." The order, similar to the 2017 travel ban, would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and grant broad authority to border officials. Critics argue it would refuse protection to those fleeing persecution, while legal challenges are expected. Trump has also threatened to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan, and the administration plans to deploy additional troops to the border. The move has been condemned as an "abuse" of the asylum system and a "disgraceful" escalation of presidential power. Some experts predict courts may uphold the ban despite its policy flaws.  

**END OF SUMMARY.**
