SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an order to block migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its controversial travel ban. This action would effectively bar asylum seekers from entering the country, and give broad authority to border officials. The move comes as thousands of Central American migrants make their way towards the U.S., with President Trump blaming Democrats for the so-called caravan. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that such an order would be a "moral failure," as it would refuse protection to those fleeing persecution. However, immigration law experts argue that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as it did with the travel ban. The move has been criticized as a "racism-driven cruelty" by the National Immigration Law Center, which has vowed to legally challenge any such order. This potential executive order underscores the Trump administration's hardline stance on immigration and its willingness to use national security concerns to justify restrictive border policies.
END OF SUMMARY.
