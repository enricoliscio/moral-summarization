SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an order to deny asylum to migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its earlier travel ban. This action would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country, and give broad authority to officials at the border to refuse entry to undocumented migrants. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents.

The potential executive order has been criticized by immigration advocates as a "huge moral failure" and an example of the administration's "racism-driven cruelty." They argue that it would mean refusing to protect people fleeing persecution and that it would be subject to intense legal scrutiny. However, some legal experts believe that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as they did with the previous travel ban.

The White House has not confirmed the details of the potential executive order, but it is reportedly among several legal, executive, and legislative options being considered to address undocumented immigration in the lead-up to the midterm elections. The administration has also threatened to cut aid to Central American countries and blamed Democrats for the so-called caravan of migrants headed to the U.S.-Mexico border.
END OF SUMMARY.
