SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. This would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. The order would give broad authority to border officials and would be similar to the travel ban implemented in 2017. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents. President Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan and has threatened to cut off aid to three Central American countries. Critics have called the potential order "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure", while others believe courts could uphold the president's actions. The move is seen as a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy.

END OF SUMMARY.
