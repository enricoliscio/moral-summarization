Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article talks about the Trump administration considering a new executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the previous travel ban. This would deny asylum claims, effectively barring those seeking refuge. The administration is also sending more troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. The author uses words like "bar," "deny," "undocumented," "cruelty," "failure," and "abuse," which carry strong moral connotations.

I need to make sure the summary includes these morally framed words. I'll start by identifying the key actions: the potential executive order, troop deployment, aid threats, and the legal challenges. Then, I'll incorporate the moral terms to reflect the author's perspective, such as "racism-driven cruelty," "huge moral failure," and "disgraceful."

I should structure the summary to first mention the administration's consideration of the order, then the troop deployment, followed by the aid threats. Next, I'll include the legal and moral criticisms, using terms like "challenge," "fight," "failure," and "cruelty." Finally, I'll note the broader implications, like undermining the Constitution and international laws.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key points are covered without losing the moral tone. Let me draft that.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to bar migrants at the southern border, denying asylum claims based on national security concerns, which would effectively prevent undocumented individuals from entering the U.S. This action, reminiscent of the 2017 travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries, has sparked moral and legal scrutiny. The administration is also deploying additional troops to the border to support immigration enforcement, and Trump has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan. Critics, including immigration rights advocates, condemn the plan as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," arguing it undermines constitutional and international laws. Legal challenges are expected, as the order would refuse protection to those fleeing persecution, marking a significant escalation in immigration policy. The administration's actions have been labeled "disgraceful" and "cruel," with experts warning of potential legal battles despite the Supreme Court's past support for similar bans. END OF SUMMARY.
