SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering issuing an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the travel ban implemented earlier in the administration. The order would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to border officials. This comes as thousands of Central American migrants make their way towards the US-Mexico border, with President Trump blaming Democrats for the caravan and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border to provide support and fortify defenses. The potential executive order has drawn criticism from immigration advocates, who argue that it would be a "moral failure" and a form of "racism-driven cruelty." However, some legal experts believe that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as they did with the previous travel ban. The order, if implemented, would effectively bar asylum seekers from entering the country.
END OF SUMMARY.
