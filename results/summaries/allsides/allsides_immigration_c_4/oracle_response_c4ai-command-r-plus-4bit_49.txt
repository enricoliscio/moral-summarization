SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering using the same authority as its earlier travel ban to block the entry of migrants at the southern border, according to a person familiar with the matter. This action would effectively bar asylum seekers from entering the country, denying them protection from persecution or torture. The move has been criticized by immigration advocates as a "huge moral failure" and "disgraceful," with the potential to undermine international laws and the U.S. Constitution. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that the potential executive order, which is still in the planning stages, is driven by racism and cruelty. Meanwhile, supporters of the potential ban argue that it addresses concerns of abuse of the asylum system by economic migrants. The move comes as thousands of Central American migrants make their way towards the U.S. border, with President Trump blaming Democrats for the so-called caravan and threatening to take action to prevent undocumented immigrants from crossing the border.
END OF SUMMARY.
