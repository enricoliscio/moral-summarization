SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, effectively barring those seeking asylum from entering the country. This "racism-driven cruelty" would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns, giving broad authority to border officials. The move is seen as a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy. Critics have labeled the plan as "disgraceful" and a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The administration's consideration of such action has been met with outrage, with many arguing that it would be a "huge moral failure" and subject to intense legal scrutiny. The plan has been called "stupid and cruel" by experts, who believe it would not make sense from a policy perspective. END OF SUMMARY.
