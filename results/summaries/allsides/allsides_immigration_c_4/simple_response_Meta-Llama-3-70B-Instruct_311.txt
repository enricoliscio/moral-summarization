SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively denying asylum to those fleeing persecution. This move is seen as a cruel and racist attempt to impose a "Latin ban" and undermine the Constitution and international laws. The proposed order would give broad authority to border officials and would likely face intense legal scrutiny. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, which critics argue is a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. Human rights advocates have condemned the move, calling it "racism-driven cruelty" and "disgraceful". The plan is seen as a desperate attempt to appeal to Trump's base before the midterm elections, and critics argue that it would be a "huge moral failure" if implemented.

END OF SUMMARY.
