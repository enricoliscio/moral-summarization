SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, effectively denying asylum claims based on national security concerns. This move would be a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy, and would give broad authority to border officials. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border, citing a "national emergency". Critics have denounced the proposed action as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution.

The move is seen as a political ploy to galvanize Trump's base ahead of the midterm elections, with the president blaming Democrats for the migrant caravan. Human rights advocates have vowed to fight the order, calling it "disgraceful" and "cruel". The plan would undermine the Constitution and international laws, and would be subject to intense legal scrutiny.

END OF SUMMARY.
