SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants from entering the US at the southern border, citing national security concerns. The order would deny asylum claims and give broad authority to border officials. This move is seen as a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the border to support Customs and Border Protection agents. President Trump has blamed Democrats for the migrant caravan and threatened to cut off US aid to three Central American countries. Critics have called the potential order "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure", while others believe courts could uphold the president's actions. The move is seen as a bid to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing the US-Mexican frontier.

END OF SUMMARY.
