SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to the travel ban implemented in 2017. The order would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to border officials. This comes as thousands of Central American migrants make their way towards the U.S.-Mexico border, with President Trump blaming Democrats for the so-called caravan. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that such an executive order would be a moral failure and a cruel rejection of those seeking asylum. However, immigration law experts suggest that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as it did with the travel ban. The potential order has not yet been finalized, and the White House is considering various legal, executive, and legislative options.
