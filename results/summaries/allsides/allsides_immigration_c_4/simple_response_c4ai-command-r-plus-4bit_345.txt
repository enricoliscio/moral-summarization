SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering issuing an order to block migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its previous travel ban. This action would effectively deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to border officials. The move comes as thousands of Central American migrants make their way towards the US, with Trump blaming Democrats for the "caravan" and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. The potential executive order has been criticized by immigration advocates as a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure." However, an immigration law professor argued that the Supreme Court could uphold the president's actions, as it did with the previous travel ban. Meanwhile, the administration plans to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries, although this is complicated by congressional appropriations. Critics argue that the move to block migrants is unnecessary and cruel, while the administration cites concerns about national security and abuse of the asylum system.
END OF SUMMARY.
