SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to its earlier travel ban. This action would effectively deny asylum claims and give broad authority to officials to bar undocumented migrants from entering the country. The move has been criticized as a "huge moral failure" and "racism-driven cruelty" by immigration advocates, who are prepared to legally challenge any such order. The administration is also planning to send additional troops to the border and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Critics argue that the potential executive order makes no sense from a policy perspective and would be stupid and cruel. Supporters argue that it is necessary to protect the country and prevent abuse of the asylum system. The order, if implemented, would join a range of other legislative and executive remedies to address undocumented immigration, which has been a front-burner issue for President Trump in the lead-up to the midterm elections.
END OF SUMMARY.
