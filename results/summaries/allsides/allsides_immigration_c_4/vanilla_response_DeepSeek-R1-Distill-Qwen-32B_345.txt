Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about the Trump administration considering a new order to block migrants at the southern border, similar to their earlier travel ban. They're targeting Central Americans, including those seeking asylum. The president is looking at various options to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing. They mentioned using national security concerns to deny asylum claims. The New York Times reported that this could bar migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering. The White House is considering legal and legislative options, and it's all happening before the midterm elections. Trump is blaming Democrats for the migrant caravan. He also sent more troops to the border for support, and there are threats to cut aid to Central American countries. Legal challenges are expected, with groups like the National Immigration Law Center preparing to fight. Some experts think the courts might uphold this, even if it's seen as cruel. The article also mentions how migrants are crossing into Mexico and the process they'd face upon reaching the U.S. border. There's criticism about the low bar for asylum claims allowing abuse.

So, the main points are: Trump considering a border ban using national security, targeting Central American migrants, including asylum seekers.

The U.S. plans to deploy additional troops to the border for support and has threatened to cut aid to Central American countries. Legal challenges are expected, with critics calling the move "racism-driven cruelty." The administration's actions, while potentially upheld by courts, face criticism for being morally and policy-wise flawed. Migrants crossing into Mexico face detention and asylum processes, with concerns about abuse of the asylum system. END OF SUMMARY.
