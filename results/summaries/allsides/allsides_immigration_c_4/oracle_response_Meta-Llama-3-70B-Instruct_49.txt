SUMMARY:

The Trump administration is considering an executive order to deny asylum claims and block migrants from entering the country, citing national security concerns. This move would effectively bar thousands of Central Americans, including those seeking asylum, from entering the US. The administration is also planning to send at least 800 additional troops to the US-Mexico border, which would include providing support for border agents and building temporary barriers. Critics have slammed the proposal as "racism-driven cruelty" and a "moral failure" that would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. The ACLU has called the plan "disgraceful" and vowed to challenge it in court. The move is seen as a escalation of presidential power on immigration policy, and has sparked outrage among immigration advocates who argue it would undermine the Constitution and international laws. The proposal has been met with legal challenges and criticism, with many calling it a "huge moral failure" that would cruelly deny protection to those in need.

END OF SUMMARY.
