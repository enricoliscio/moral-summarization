Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing used by the author. The user provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. I'll start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the Trump administration considering an executive order to block migrants at the southern border, using similar authority as the 2017 travel ban. This would deny asylum claims based on national security, affecting Central American migrants. The administration is also sending troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries. There's opposition from legal groups and experts, who argue this is a moral failure and unconstitutional.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary (under 200 words) that includes as many of the listed moral terms as possible. I'll focus on key actions, the administration's justifications, and the reactions from opponents. I'll make sure to highlight the moral implications, such as cruelty, failure, and the undermining of legal protections.

I should structure the summary to first mention the proposed executive order, its impact on asylum seekers, the deployment of troops, and the threats to cut aid. Then, I'll include the criticisms from legal groups and experts, emphasizing the moral and legal issues. Finally, I'll touch on the administration's justification, like combating illegal entry and preventing national security risks, but note the potential legal challenges.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the administration's actions, followed by the consequences and criticisms, and ending with the context of the midterm elections and the legal landscape.

Let me piece this together, making sure to use the moral terms effectively without making the summary too verbose. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit and ensure all critical points are covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration is considering an executive order to bar migrants at the southern border, denying asylum claims based on national security concerns, similar to its 2017 travel ban. This action, if implemented, would block undocumented migrants, including those seeking asylum, from entering the U.S. The administration is also deploying troops to the border and threatening to cut aid to Central American countries over the migrant caravan. Critics, including legal groups like the National Immigration Law Center and the ACLU, argue this plan is a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure," as it would refuse to protect people fleeing persecution. They vow to fight the order, which they say undermines the Constitution and international law. Immigration experts note that while courts might uphold such a ban, it would be "stupid and cruel." The administration's actions, including sending troops and cutting aid, are seen as part of a broader effort to address undocumented immigration ahead of the midterm elections. END OF SUMMARY.
