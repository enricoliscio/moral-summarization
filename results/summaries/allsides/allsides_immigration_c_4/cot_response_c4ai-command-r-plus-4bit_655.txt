SUMMARY:
The Trump administration is considering using the same authority as its earlier travel ban to block the entry of migrants at the southern border, a move that would effectively bar those seeking asylum. This action is being considered in response to the thousands of Central American migrants making their way towards the US. The potential executive order would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns and give broad authority to officials at the border to turn away those seeking protection. 

This potential action has been criticized by immigration advocates as a "racism-driven cruelty" and a "huge moral failure." The administration's plan to send additional troops to the border and cut aid to Central American countries has also been met with backlash. Critics argue that the measures are unnecessary and inhumane, and that they make no sense from a policy perspective. 

The migrants, who are currently crossing into southern Mexico, would typically be detained at the US border and asked if they fear returning to their home country. If they express fear of persecution or torture, they would be interviewed by an asylum officer to establish credible fear. The current system aims to protect those seeking asylum, but the Trump administration's potential executive order could undermine these protections and deny entry to those in need.
END OF SUMMARY.
