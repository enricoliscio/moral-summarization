SUMMARY:
The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who may have received access to National Security Agency reports that identified Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser, by name. The list includes 39 officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, who were authorized recipients of the information. However, promoters of President Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the list to bolster their phony claim that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. In reality, Flynn was no innocent actor, having secretly agreed to lobby for Turkey and having potentially compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. The list has sparked false claims, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) quickly misrepresenting the list to smear Biden. END OF SUMMARY.
