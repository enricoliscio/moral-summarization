Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points.

The article is about the Trump administration releasing a list of Obama officials who might have accessed NSA reports mentioning Michael Flynn. Flynn was Trump's national security advisor and was involved in conversations with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. The NSA surveillance picked up these talks where Flynn tried to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama.

The list was declassified by Richard Grenell and made public by Sen. Grassley. It includes 39 officials, like Comey, Biden, and others, who were authorized to receive the reports. The note clarifies that these officials were given access through normal protocols, but it's unclear who actually saw Flynn's name.

Some, like Sen. Paul, are using this to claim Obamagate, falsely accusing Obama of smearing Flynn. However, there's no evidence Biden or others ordered the unmasking, and Flynn had his own issues, like lying to the FBI and having ties to foreign governments.

So, the summary should cover the release of the list, who was on it, the context of Flynn's involvement, the claims of Obamagate, and the lack of evidence against Obama officials. Keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has released a list of Obama-era officials who may have accessed NSA reports mentioning Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, during Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak's surveillance. The list, declassified by acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, includes 39 officials, such as FBI Director James Comey and Vice President Joe Biden, who were authorized to receive the reports. It remains unclear who specifically viewed Flynn's unmasked information. Trump supporters have used this to promote the false "Obamagate" claim, suggesting Obama orchestrated Flynn's smear. However, there is no evidence Biden or others ordered Flynn's unmasking, and Flynn's own actions, including lying to the FBI and having ties to foreign governments, have raised red flags. The list also includes ambassadors to Turkey and Russia, reflecting Flynn's potential compromising relationships. END OF SUMMARY.
