Okay, so I'm trying to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has given specific instructions to include as many of the morally charged words as possible. First, I need to understand the article's content.

The article talks about the Trump administration releasing a list of Obama officials who may have accessed NSA reports about Flynn. Flynn was involved in conversations with the Russian ambassador, trying to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The list was declassified and released by Grassley, and it includes 39 officials, some of whom might have seen Flynn's name unmasked. The article also mentions that the list is being used to promote the false "Obamagate" claim, with figures like Paul and Fox News misrepresenting the information to smear Biden.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words from the article: attempted, influence, interference, seized, promoters, claim, lying, misrepresenting, bolster, misrepresented, smear, ordered, abused, involved, broken, interfering, flags, agreed, lobby, transfer, ties.

I should structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by outlining the key points: the release of the list, the context of Flynn's actions, the declassification process, the inclusion of notable officials, and the misuse of the information to support a false claim.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral terms. I'll mention that the list was released to show who might have accessed the reports, highlighting the attempt to influence Russia. Then, I'll note the declassification and the 39 officials, including Biden and others. The article points out that there's no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking, but even if he did, it's not controversial. However, promoters are using this to misrepresent and bolster the false claim, trying to smear Biden. The article also mentions Flynn's own issues, like lying and having ties to foreign governments.

I should ensure that each morally charged word is used contextually. For example, "promoters" are misrepresenting the information to bolster their claim, which is a smear. I need to keep the summary balanced, presenting the facts while highlighting the moral framing.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll also make sure the flow is logical, moving from the release of the list, the context, the misuse of the information, and the implications.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it meets all the user's requirements, including the use of the specified moral terms and the correct structure with the tokens.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a list of Obama-era officials who may have accessed NSA reports revealing Michael Flynn's name in electronic surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser, had attempted to influence Russia's reaction to U.S. sanctions. The list, declassified at the request of Richard Grenell, includes 39 officials, such as James Comey and Joe Biden, who were authorized recipients of the report. However, it remains unclear if these officials saw the unmasked information. The release has been seized upon by promoters of the false "Obamagate" claim, which alleges Obama orchestrated the unmasking to smear Flynn. Sen. Rand Paul and Fox News have misrepresented the list to suggest Biden abused his power, despite no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with Kislyak, had ties to foreign governments, including Turkey, and was under FBI investigation for potential interference in U.S. foreign policy. The article highlights the misuse of declassified information to bolster false claims and smear political opponents. END OF SUMMARY.
