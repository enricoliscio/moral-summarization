SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who "may have received" access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The list includes 39 officials, including James Comey, Joe Biden, and John Brennan, who were authorized recipients of the information. However, promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the list to bolster their false claim that Obama was involved in unfairly smearing Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador. The Justice Department is now trying to drop the case, and Trump boosters are seizing on the new information to smear Biden and other officials. Despite the lack of evidence, Sen. Rand Paul falsely tweeted that Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn's private conversation, suggesting he may have abused his power to target a political opponent. In reality, Flynn's suspect activities, including his attempts to lobby for Turkey and potentially compromising ties to foreign states, raised red flags among Obama officials. 

END OF SUMMARY.
