SUMMARY: The Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list, declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. Sen. Rand Paul misrepresented the list, falsely claiming that Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn's private conversation. While Biden was on the authorized list, there is no evidence he personally ordered the unmasking. The unmasking of Flynn's identity was approved through normal protocols, as Flynn had suspicious ties to foreign states, including Russia and Turkey. The release of the list has been used to promote Trump's false "Obamagate" claim, which alleges that Obama unfairly smeared Flynn during the presidential transition. The Justice Department is trying to drop charges against Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. However, Flynn was no innocent actor, as he had admitted to lying to the DOJ and had compromising ties to foreign states.

END OF SUMMARY.
