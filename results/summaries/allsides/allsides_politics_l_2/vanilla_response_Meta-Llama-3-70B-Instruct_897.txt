SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of 39 Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, by name. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, among others. The reports revealed Flynn's secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which he attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama. The list has been seized upon by Trump supporters to promote the "Obamagate" claim, falsely suggesting that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. However, the list simply shows that authorized officials with regular access to classified information were informed of Flynn's suspect activities. There is no evidence that Biden personally ordered Flynn's "unmasking." Flynn had previously pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Kislyak.

END OF SUMMARY.
