SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who "may have received" access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama. The list includes 39 officials, including James Comey, Joe Biden, and John Brennan, who were authorized to receive the information. However, promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the list to bolster their false claim that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Despite this, the Justice Department is trying to drop the case. Sen. Rand Paul falsely tweeted that Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn's private conversation, which has no evidence to support it. Flynn's actions raised red flags, including secretly lobbying for Turkey and potentially compromising ties to foreign states. Obama officials had legitimate reasons to review reports referencing Flynn's clandestine contacts with foreign governments. END OF SUMMARY.
