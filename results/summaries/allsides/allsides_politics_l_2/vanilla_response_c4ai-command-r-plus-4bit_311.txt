SUMMARY: The Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes 39 officials such as FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and Vice President Joe Biden. The list has been seized upon by promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim, which alleges that Obama unfairly smeared Flynn during the presidential transition. However, the list does not provide evidence of this claim and authorized officials with access to classified information were permitted to hear about Flynn's activities. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which were picked up by NSA surveillance. The Justice Department is now trying to drop the case against Flynn at Trump's behest. Despite no evidence, Senator Rand Paul claimed that Biden ordered Flynn's "unmasking," misrepresenting the information to smear Biden.

END OF SUMMARY.
