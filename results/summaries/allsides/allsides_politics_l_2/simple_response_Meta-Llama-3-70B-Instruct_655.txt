SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list includes 39 officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. However, the list has been misinterpreted by Trump supporters to fuel the false "Obamagate" claim that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. In reality, the officials on the list were authorized to access classified information and Flynn's activities were suspect, having secretly conversed with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and lied to FBI agents about it. The Justice Department is now trying to drop the case against Flynn, despite his guilty plea. The release of the list is a desperate attempt to distract from Flynn's wrongdoing and shift blame onto Obama officials. It's essential to separate fact from fiction and recognize the morally dubious behavior of Flynn and the Trump administration.
