SUMMARY:
The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who may have received access to National Security Agency reports identifying Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list includes 39 officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. However, the list has been seized upon by promoters of President Trump's "Obamagate" claim, which is a false and phony claim that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. In reality, officials with regular access to classified information were authorized to hear about Flynn's suspect activities, which included clandestine high-level contacts with foreign governments. Flynn had potentially compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia, and had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The release of the list has been misused to smear Biden and other Obama officials, but it's safe to say that no past incoming National Security advisers had the sort of red flags that Flynn did.
END OF SUMMARY.
