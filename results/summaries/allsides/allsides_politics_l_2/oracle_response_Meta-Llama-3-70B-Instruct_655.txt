SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who "may have received" access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, who attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, among others. However, promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the information to bolster their false narrative that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. In reality, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The Justice Department is now trying to drop the case, despite Flynn's suspect activities and potential compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. The list has been seized upon by Trump boosters, who are misrepresenting the facts to smear Biden and other Obama officials. The truth is that these officials were authorized to review reports referencing Flynn's clandestine contacts with foreign governments, and it's hardly controversial that they would do so.
