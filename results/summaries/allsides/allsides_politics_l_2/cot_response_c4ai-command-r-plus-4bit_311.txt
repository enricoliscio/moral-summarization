SUMMARY:
The Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security advisor. The reports detailed Flynn's secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which Flynn attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. While the list does not prove that Biden personally ordered Flynn's "unmasking," Senator Rand Paul has misrepresented the information to smear Biden, falsely claiming that he abused his power to target a political opponent. The report highlights Flynn's suspicious activities and potentially compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. The unmasking was approved through normal protocols, and the list of officials who may have seen Flynn's identity includes Biden, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, McDonough, and Lew. Trump supporters have seized on the list to promote the false "Obamagate" claim, which alleges that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn during the presidential transition. The Justice Department is currently seeking to drop charges against Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak. The report raises concerns about Flynn's inappropriate contacts with foreign governments and his potential status as a Russian asset.
