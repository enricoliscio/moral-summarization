SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of 39 Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, later Trump's national security adviser, in conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. The report does not indicate who actually saw the unmasked information, but notes that 16 officials requested unmaskings for different NSA intelligence reports. The release of the list has been seized upon by promoters of the "Obamagate" claim, falsely suggesting that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. However, the list simply shows that authorized officials with regular access to classified information were informed of Flynn's suspect activities.

END OF SUMMARY.
