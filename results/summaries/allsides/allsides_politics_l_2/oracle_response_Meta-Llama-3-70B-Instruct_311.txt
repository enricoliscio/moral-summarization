SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who "may have received" access to National Security Agency reports identifying Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The reports revealed Flynn's secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which he attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama. The list includes 39 officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, who were authorized recipients of the information. However, promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the list, falsely suggesting that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. In reality, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Kislyak. The Justice Department is now trying to drop the case, and Trump boosters are seizing on the new information to bolster their phony claim. Sen. Rand Paul has already misrepresented the list to smear Biden, despite no evidence that Biden personally ordered Flynn's "unmasking."

END OF SUMMARY.
