SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, in secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes 39 officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. However, the list has been misinterpreted by Trump supporters to promote the false "Obamagate" claim that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. In reality, the officials on the list were authorized to receive the information and Flynn's activities were suspect, having pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with Kislyak. The Justice Department is now trying to drop the case, and Trump boosters are misrepresenting the new information to smear Biden and other Obama officials. The truth is that Flynn had compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia, and Obama officials were justified in reviewing reports about his clandestine activities.
