SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to reports from the National Security Agency (NSA) in which Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, was identified. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Vice President Joe Biden.

While the list has been used to promote President Trump's "Obamagate" claim, a false allegation that Obama tried to smear Flynn during the presidential transition, the reality is that Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The unmasking of Flynn's identity was approved through normal protocol, and it is not controversial that officials would want to review reports referencing an American with suspicious ties to foreign governments. Flynn had potential ties to both Turkey and Russia, explaining why ambassadors to these countries were among those given access to information about him. Sadly, some, like Senator Rand Paul, have misrepresented the information to smear Biden, even though there is no evidence he personally ordered Flynn's unmasking.

END OF SUMMARY.
