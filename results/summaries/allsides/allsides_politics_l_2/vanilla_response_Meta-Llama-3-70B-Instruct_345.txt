SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of 39 Obama administration officials who may have had access to National Security Agency (NSA) reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, by name. The reports were from electronic surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which Flynn attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, among others. While the list does not indicate who actually saw the "unmasked" information, it has been seized upon by promoters of the "Obamagate" claim, falsely suggesting that Obama was involved in unfairly smearing Flynn. However, the list simply shows that authorized officials with regular access to classified information were allowed to review reports referencing Flynn's suspect activities.

END OF SUMMARY.
