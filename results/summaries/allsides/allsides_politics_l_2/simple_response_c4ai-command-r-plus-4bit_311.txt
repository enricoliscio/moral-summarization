SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports revealing Michael Flynn's identity in surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes prominent figures such as FBI Director James Comey, Vice President Joe Biden, and CIA Director John Brennan. While the list does not prove that these individuals requested Flynn's "unmasking," it has been misrepresented by Trump supporters to bolster the false "Obamagate" claim. Senator Rand Paul, for example, falsely asserted that declassified documents show Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn's private conversation. In reality, Biden and other officials had legitimate reasons to review reports referencing an American with suspicious ties to foreign governments. Flynn himself pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak and had secret ties to Turkey and Russia. The release of this list is part of an effort by the Trump administration and its supporters to discredit the investigation into Flynn and Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
