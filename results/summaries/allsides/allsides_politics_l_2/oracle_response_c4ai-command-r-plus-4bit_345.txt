SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports involving Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes 39 officials, such as FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and Vice President Joe Biden, who may have seen Flynn's identity in a report. The report relates to Flynn's attempts to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama in response to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The release of the list has been seized upon by promoters of President Trump's "Obamagate" claim, which alleges that Obama unfairly smeared Flynn during the presidential transition. However, the memo to Grenell states that each named person was an authorized recipient of the information, and there is no evidence that Biden personally ordered Flynn's unmasking. It is important to note that Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and had potentially compromising ties to foreign states.
END OF SUMMARY.
