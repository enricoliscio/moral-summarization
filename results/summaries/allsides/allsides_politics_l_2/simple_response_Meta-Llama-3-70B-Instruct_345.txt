SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, later Trump's national security adviser, in secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes 39 officials, including James Comey, Joe Biden, and John Brennan, who were authorized to receive the information. However, the list has been misused by Trump supporters to promote the false "Obamagate" claim that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. In reality, Flynn had a history of suspect activities, including lying to the FBI and having compromising ties to foreign states. The Obama officials' review of the reports was a legitimate exercise of their duties, and there is no evidence that Biden or others abused their power. The release of the list is a desperate attempt to distract from Flynn's own wrongdoing and the Justice Department's controversial decision to drop charges against him.

END OF SUMMARY.
