SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports in which Michael Flynn was identified. The list, deceptively portrayed by Trump boosters as evidence of an "Obamagate" conspiracy to smear Flynn, includes several high-ranking officials such as Joe Biden, James Comey, and James Clapper. While some, like Senator Rand Paul, have falsely claimed that Biden ordered Flynn's "unmasking," there is no evidence to support this allegation. The list merely indicates that these individuals were authorized to access information about Flynn's suspect activities, which included potential ties to foreign governments and illegal interference in foreign policy. Despite Flynn's admitted lies and red flags surrounding his conduct, the Trump administration and its supporters continue to portray him as an innocent victim of political persecution. This narrative, however, ignores the legitimate national security concerns that prompted the initial investigation and the subsequent unmasking requests. END OF SUMMARY.
