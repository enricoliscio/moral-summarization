Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, and I should include as many as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The Trump administration released a list of Obama officials who may have had access to NSA reports mentioning Michael Flynn. Flynn was involved in conversations with the Russian ambassador, trying to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The list was declassified and made public, including officials like Comey, Biden, etc. The article also mentions that Trump supporters are using this to promote "Obamagate," a false claim that Obama was involved in smearing Flynn. The author points out that there's no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking, and Flynn had his own issues, like lying to the FBI and having ties to foreign governments.

Now, I need to highlight the moral framing. Words like "attempted," "influence," "interference," "seized," "promoters," "lying," "misrepresenting," "smear," "abused," etc., should be included. I'll structure the summary to show the release of the list, the context of Flynn's actions, the false claims, and the lack of evidence against Biden.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the release of the list, then the context of Flynn's actions, the false claims by Trump supporters, and the lack of evidence against Biden. I'll use the moral words to convey the author's perspective on the situation.

Let me draft this step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral terms are appropriately used. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has released a list of Obama-era officials who may have accessed NSA reports revealing Michael Flynn's name in Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak's conversations. Flynn, later Trump's national security adviser, attempted to influence Russia's response to Obama's sanctions over election interference. The list, declassified by Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, includes 39 officials like FBI Director James Comey and Vice President Joe Biden, though it's unclear if they saw the unmasked information. Trump supporters, promoting the false "Obamagate" claim, misrepresent the list to smear Biden, falsely suggesting he ordered Flynn's unmasking. However, no evidence exists that Biden did so, and Flynn's own actions—like lying to the FBI and having compromising ties to foreign governments—raise red flags. The article highlights how Trump boosters are misusing the information to bolster their false narrative. END OF SUMMARY.
