SUMMARY:
The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who may have received access to NSA reports on Michael Flynn's secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes 39 officials, including James Comey, Joe Biden, and John Brennan, who were authorized to receive the information. However, promoters of President Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the list to falsely suggest that Obama was involved in unfairly smearing Flynn. In reality, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Kislyak and had potentially compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. The list has been seized on by Trump boosters, including Sen. Rand Paul, who falsely claimed that Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn's private conversation. The release of the list is an attempt to bolster the phony claim that Obama was involved in a conspiracy against Flynn. END OF SUMMARY.
