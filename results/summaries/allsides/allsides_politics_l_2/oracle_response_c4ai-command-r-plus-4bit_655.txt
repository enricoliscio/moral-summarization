SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports revealing Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. While the list does not prove that these officials requested Flynn's identity to be "unmasked," it has been seized upon by promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim as evidence of a smear campaign. The list includes Biden, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, McDonough, and Lew, among others. Sen. Rand Paul misrepresented the information, falsely claiming that Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn's conversation. In reality, Flynn was under investigation by the FBI for his suspicious ties to foreign states, including Russia and Turkey, and his attempts to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The unmasking was approved through normal protocols, as Flynn's activities raised red flags and he potentially broke laws against private citizens interfering in foreign policy. The release of this list is part of Trump's effort to discredit the case against Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak.

END OF SUMMARY.
