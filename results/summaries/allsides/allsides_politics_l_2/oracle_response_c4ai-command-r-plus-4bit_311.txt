SUMMARY: The Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who had access to NSA reports on Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which Flynn attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama due to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The list, declassified at the request of acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. While the list does not prove that Biden personally ordered Flynn's "unmasking," it has been seized by Trump promoters to bolster the false "Obamagate" claim. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) misrepresented the information, tweeting that "Biden ordered the unmasking of General Flynn's private conversation," when in fact, Biden was simply an authorized recipient of the information. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Kislyak and had admitted to breaking the law against private citizens interfering in foreign policy. He also had potentially compromising ties to Turkey and Russia, which may explain why Obama officials, including the US Ambassadors to Turkey and Russia, were given access to information about him.
END OF SUMMARY.
