SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of 39 Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, in conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, among others. However, the list does not imply that these officials requested Flynn's name be unredacted or "unmasked" in the reports. Rather, they were authorized recipients of the original reports and may or may not have seen the unmasked information. The release of the list has been seized upon by promoters of the "Obamagate" claim, which falsely accuses Obama of unfairly targeting Flynn. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and Flynn's conversations with Kislyak were suspect and potentially compromising to national security.

END OF SUMMARY.
