SUMMARY: The Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to reports from NSA electronic surveillance in which Michael Flynn was identified. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Vice President Joe Biden. The list has been seized on by promoters of President Trump's "Obamagate" claim, which alleges that Obama unfairly smeared Flynn during the presidential transition. However, the list does not provide evidence of any wrongdoing by Obama officials, and the unmasking of Flynn's identity was approved through normal protocols. Meanwhile, Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and had other red flags, including potentially compromising ties to foreign states.

END OF SUMMARY.
