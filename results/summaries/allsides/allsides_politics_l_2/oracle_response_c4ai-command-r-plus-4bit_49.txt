SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports in which Michael Flynn was identified. The list, de-classified at the request of Acting DNI Richard Grenell, includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, DNI James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Vice President Joe Biden. The report suggests that these officials were authorized to hear about Flynn's suspect activities, including his attempts to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama in response to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. However, promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim have seized on the list to bolster their false claim that Obama unfairly smeared Flynn. They have misrepresented the information, with Fox News falsely stating that Biden "sought to 'unmask' Flynn." While Biden was on the authorized list, there is no evidence he personally ordered Flynn's unmasking. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and admitted to secretly lobbying for Turkey while advising Trump. He also had compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. The Obama officials given access to information on Flynn included the US Ambassadors to Turkey and Russia.
END OF SUMMARY.
