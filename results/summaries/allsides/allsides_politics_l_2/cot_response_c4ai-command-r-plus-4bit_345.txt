SUMMARY: 
The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports revealing Michael Flynn's identity in surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes FBI Director James Comey, Vice President Joe Biden, and other high-ranking officials. While the list does not prove that Biden personally ordered Flynn's "unmasking," Trump supporters are misrepresenting the information to bolster their "Obamagate" claimâ€”a false allegation that Obama tried to smear Flynn during the presidential transition. The truth is that Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Kislyak, and the FBI had legitimate concerns about his potential status as a Russian asset and illegal interference in foreign policy. Flynn also had secret dealings with Turkey and Russia, which may explain why Obama officials with access to the NSA reports included the US Ambassadors to those countries. Despite this, Senator Rand Paul has publicly accused Biden of abusing his power to target a political opponent. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and Biden's access to the report was not unusual given Flynn's suspect activities and compromising ties to foreign states.
END OF SUMMARY.
