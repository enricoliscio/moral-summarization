SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports involving Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Sen. Charles Grassley. It includes 39 officials, such as FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and Vice President Joe Biden, who may have seen Flynn's identity in a report on his secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. While the list has been seized by promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim, it is important to note that there is no evidence that Biden personally ordered Flynn's "unmasking." The report suggests that Flynn had potentially compromising ties to foreign states, including Russia and Turkey, and that the unmasking was approved through normal protocols. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak, but the Justice Department is now trying to drop the case. Despite this, Trump boosters are misrepresenting the information to bolster their phony claim.
END OF SUMMARY.
