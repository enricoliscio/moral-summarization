SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of 39 Obama officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, in secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes high-ranking officials such as FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. However, the list does not imply that these officials asked for Flynn's name to be unredacted or "unmasked" in the reports. Rather, they were authorized recipients of the original reports and may have seen the unmasked information. Despite this, Trump supporters are misrepresenting the list to bolster their false "Obamagate" claim, which alleges that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. In reality, Flynn's activities were suspect, and he pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Kislyak. The Obama officials' actions were likely justified given Flynn's compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia.

END OF SUMMARY.
