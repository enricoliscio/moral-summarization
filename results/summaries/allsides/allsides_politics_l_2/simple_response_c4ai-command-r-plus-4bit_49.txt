SUMMARY: In a morally questionable move, the Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who had access to NSA reports on Michael Flynn's surveillance, including Joe Biden. While the list doesn't prove Biden ordered Flynn's "unmasking," Trump supporters are misrepresenting it to bolster their "Obamagate" claim. Flynn's guilty plea for lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts is well-known, as are his suspicious ties to Turkey and Russia. The list shows that 16 Obama officials requested "unmaskings" and 39 may have seen Flynn's identity, including top intelligence officials. The NSA affirms that all named individuals were authorized recipients. Sen. Rand Paul misrepresented the truth by claiming Biden abused his power, while Fox News falsely stated that Biden ordered Flynn's unmasking. This incident highlights the ethical dilemma of balancing national security with individual privacy rights, and the potential for abuse of power by those in high office. 

END OF SUMMARY.
