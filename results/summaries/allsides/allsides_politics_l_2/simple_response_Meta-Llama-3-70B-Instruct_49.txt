SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, in conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes 39 officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden. However, the list is being misused by Trump supporters to promote the false "Obamagate" claim that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. In reality, the officials had authorized access to classified information and the unmasking was approved through normal protocol. Flynn's conversations with Kislyak were suspect, and he pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about them. The Justice Department is now trying to drop the case, despite Flynn's compromised position, having secretly agreed to lobby for Turkey and having ties to foreign states, including Russia.
