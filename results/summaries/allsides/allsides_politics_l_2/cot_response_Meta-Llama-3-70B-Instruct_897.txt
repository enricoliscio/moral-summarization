SUMMARY:
The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who "may have received" access to National Security Agency reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, in secret conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, among others. However, promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the information to bolster their phony claim that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. In reality, Flynn had suspect activities, including attempting to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions, and had compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. The Obama officials' access to the information was authorized and necessary to review reports referencing an American involved in clandestine high-level contacts with foreign governments. Flynn's guilty plea and red flags, including secretly agreeing to lobby for Turkey, make it clear that he was no innocent actor. END OF SUMMARY.
