SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to National Security Agency reports revealing Michael Flynn's identity in surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes prominent figures such as FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and Vice President Joe Biden. While the list does not prove that these individuals requested Flynn's "unmasking," it suggests they may have had access to the information. Senator Rand Paul has misrepresented the information to smear Biden, falsely claiming that he ordered the unmasking of Flynn's conversation. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and Biden, along with other officials, had legitimate reasons to review reports involving an American with potential ties to foreign governments. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak and had other questionable ties to foreign states. The release of this list fits into Trump's "Obamagate" narrative, which accuses Obama of unfairly targeting Flynn during the presidential transition.
END OF SUMMARY.
