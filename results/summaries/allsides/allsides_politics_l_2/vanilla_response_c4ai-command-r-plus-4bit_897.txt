SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports in which Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, was identified. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Sen. Charles Grassley. It includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Vice President Joe Biden. While the list has been seized upon by promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim, it is important to note that it does not provide evidence of any wrongdoing by Obama officials. In fact, the report notes that the unmasking was approved through the NSA's normal protocol and that the officials named were authorized recipients of the information. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak but the Justice Department is now trying to drop the case. The release of the list has led to some misinformation, with some claiming that Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn, despite a lack of evidence.

END OF SUMMARY.
