Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about the Trump administration releasing a list of Obama officials who might have accessed NSA reports mentioning Michael Flynn. Flynn was Trump's national security adviser and was involved in conversations with the Russian ambassador. The NSA surveillance picked up these talks where Flynn tried to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The list was declassified and released by Sen. Grassley. It includes 39 officials, like Comey, Biden, and others, but it's unclear if they saw the unmasked info. The note says they were authorized recipients, but the unmasking was done through proper protocols.

Some people, like Trump supporters, are using this to push the "Obamagate" claim, falsely suggesting Obama tried to smear Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations. The Justice Department is trying to drop his case. The article also mentions that Biden was on the list but there's no evidence he ordered the unmasking. Flynn had ties to Turkey and Russia, which might explain why he was under surveillance.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by mentioning the release of the list, the context of Flynn's conversations, who was on the list, and the political implications. I should also note that there's no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking and that Flynn had compromising ties. I'll make sure to keep it concise and cover all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration has released a list of Obama-era officials who may have accessed NSA reports mentioning Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, in the context of his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn attempted to influence Russia's response to U.S. sanctions during the 2016 election. The list, declassified by acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, includes 39 officials, such as FBI Director James Comey and Vice President Joe Biden, but it's unclear if they saw the unmasked information. The NSA's normal protocols were followed for unmasking Flynn's name. Trump supporters are using the list to promote the false "Obamagate" claim, suggesting Obama sought to discredit Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with Kislyak, and the Justice Department is now trying to drop the case. While Biden was on the list, there's no evidence he ordered the unmasking. Flynn had potentially compromising ties to foreign governments, including Turkey and Russia, which may have warranted the surveillance. END OF SUMMARY.
