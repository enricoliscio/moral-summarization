SUMMARY:
President Trump's White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, Trump's then-incoming national security advisor, in surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list, declassified at the request of Acting DNI Richard Grenell, includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, DNI James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Vice President Joe Biden. The report suggests that 16 Obama officials requested "unmaskings" of NSA reports, and 39 officials may have seen Flynn's identity. While the report does not prove that Biden ordered Flynn's "unmasking," Senator Rand Paul has misrepresented it to smear Biden, claiming he abused his power. The report highlights Flynn's "suspect activities," including his clandestine contacts with foreign governments and his secret agreement to lobby for Turkey while advising Trump. The unmasking was authorized due to potential "red flags" and compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. The Obama administration's concern about Flynn's activities was justified, given his guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak and his potential violation of laws prohibiting private citizens from interfering in foreign policy. However, Trump boosters are misrepresenting the information to promote the false "Obamagate" claim, downplaying Flynn's compromising actions and instead portraying him as an innocent victim of political persecution.
