SUMMARY:
The Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports involving Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security advisor. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes 39 officials who may have seen Flynn's identity in surveillance reports, including Joe Biden, James Comey, James Clapper, John Brennan, and Denis McDonough. While the list has been seized upon by promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim, which falsely accuses Obama of unfairly smearing Flynn, there is no evidence that Biden personally ordered Flynn's unmasking. The unmasking process is a normal protocol used to authorize officials with regular access to classified information to hear about suspicious activities. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and the FBI had concerns about his potential ties to foreign states. However, the Justice Department is now trying to drop the case after public attacks by Trump. Despite this, it is important to note that Flynn was no innocent actor and had red flags surrounding his involvement with foreign governments.
