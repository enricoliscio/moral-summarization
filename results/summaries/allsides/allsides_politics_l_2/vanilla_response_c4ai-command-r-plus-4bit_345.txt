SUMMARY: The Trump White House has released a list of Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, in surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list was declassified at the request of Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). It includes 39 officials such as FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and Vice President Joe Biden, but does not indicate who actually saw the unredacted reports. The unmasking was approved through normal protocol, and officials with access to classified information were authorized to receive the information. Pro-Trump media and politicians have seized on the list to promote the false "Obamagate" claim that Obama unfairly targeted Flynn. However, there is no evidence that Biden personally ordered Flynn's unmasking, and it would not be unusual for officials to review reports involving an American with clandestine high-level contacts with foreign governments. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak and had other potentially compromising ties to foreign states. The release of the list is part of an effort by the Trump administration and its allies to discredit the investigation into Flynn and Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
END OF SUMMARY.
