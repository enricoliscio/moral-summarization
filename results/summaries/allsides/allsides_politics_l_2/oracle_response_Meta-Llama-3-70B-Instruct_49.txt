SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who may have received access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who attempted to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions imposed by Obama in response to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, among others. However, promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim are misrepresenting the information to bolster their false claim that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. In reality, officials with regular access to classified information were authorized to hear about Flynn's suspect activities, which included lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn's actions raised red flags, including his secret agreement to lobby for Turkey and his potential compromising ties to foreign states. The release of this list is being seized upon by Trump supporters to smear Biden and other Obama officials, despite the lack of evidence that they abused their power to target Flynn.

END OF SUMMARY.
