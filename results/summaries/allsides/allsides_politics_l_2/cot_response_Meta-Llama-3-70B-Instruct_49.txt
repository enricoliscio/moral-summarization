SUMMARY:
The Trump White House has released a list of Obama officials who may have received access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and Vice President Joe Biden, among others. However, the list has been seized upon by promoters of President Trump's "Obamagate" claim, falsely suggesting that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and had potentially compromising ties to foreign states, including Turkey and Russia. Despite this, Trump boosters are misrepresenting the new information to bolster their phony claim. The list simply shows that authorized officials were granted access to reports referencing Flynn's suspect activities, which is hardly controversial. END OF SUMMARY.
