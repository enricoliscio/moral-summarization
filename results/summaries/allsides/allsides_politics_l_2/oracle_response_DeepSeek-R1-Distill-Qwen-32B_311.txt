Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so they want the summary to include the morally charged words from the article. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the release of a list of Obama administration officials who may have accessed NSA reports about Michael Flynn. It mentions that Flynn was involved in conversations with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, trying to influence Russia's reaction to sanctions. The list was declassified and made public, and some officials, like Biden and Comey, were on it. The article also talks about how Trump supporters are using this to promote the "Obamagate" claim, falsely accusing Obama of smearing Flynn. 

I notice the author uses words like "attempted," "influence," "interference," "seized," "promoters," "lying," "misrepresenting," etc., which carry moral connotations. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight the key events: the release of the list, the context of Flynn's actions, the declassification process, the false claims by Trump supporters, and the lack of evidence against Biden. I'll make sure to use the moral words to frame the events as the author did.

I'll start by stating the release of the list and its purpose. Then, explain Flynn's actions and the officials involved. Next, mention the declassification and the note clarifying the list's intent. Then, address the false claims and misrepresentation by Trump supporters, using terms like "seized," "promoters," "false claim," "misrepresented," and "bolster." I'll also note that there's no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking and that Flynn had his own issues. 

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the necessary points with the moral framing. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions and stick to the facts as presented, using the specified words to maintain the tone.

SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a list of Obama-era officials who "may have received" access to NSA reports revealing Michael Flynn's involvement in conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser, attempted to influence Russia's reaction to U.S. sanctions imposed for interference in the 2016 election. The list, declassified at the request of acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, includes 39 officials, such as FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and Vice President Joe Biden, who were authorized recipients of the original report. However, it is unclear if these officials saw the "unmasked" information identifying Flynn. Trump supporters have seized on the list to promote the false "Obamagate" claim, alleging Obama orchestrated efforts to smear Flynn. Sen. Rand Paul misrepresented the list to smear Biden, falsely claiming Biden ordered Flynn's "unmasking." While Biden was on the list, there is no evidence he personally ordered it. Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying about his conversations with Kislyak, had potentially compromising ties to foreign governments, including Russia and Turkey. The article emphasizes the moral framing of Flynn's actions and the misuse of the list to bolster false claims. END OF SUMMARY.
