Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the Trump administration releasing a list of Obama officials who may have had access to NSA reports that included Michael Flynn's name. Flynn was Trump's national security adviser but had some shady dealings with the Russian ambassador. The NSA surveillance picked up conversations where Flynn tried to influence Russia's response to sanctions imposed by Obama.

The list was declassified and made public by Sen. Grassley. It mentions 39 officials, including Comey, Lew, Clapper, Brennan, McDonough, and Biden. The note clarifies that these were authorized recipients but doesn't specify who actually saw the unmasked info. The article also talks about how Trump supporters are using this to push the "Obamagate" claim, which is false, suggesting Obama was involved in smearing Flynn.

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but the Justice Department is trying to drop the case after Trump's public support. The article clarifies that there's no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking, and even if he did, it's not controversial. Flynn had a lot of red flags, like secretly lobbying for Turkey while advising Trump and lying about it. The Obama officials included ambassadors to Turkey and Russia, which makes sense given Flynn's ties.

I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the release of the list, who was on it, the context of Flynn's actions, the false claims by Trump supporters, and the background on Flynn's issues. I should make sure to mention that there's no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking and that Flynn had multiple red flags.

Let me structure this. Start with the release of the list, who was on it, the context of Flynn's conversations. Then mention the false claims and the attempt to drop charges. Finally, note Flynn's other issues and the authorized recipients. Keep it concise and under 200 words.

Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, was involved in conversations where he tried to influence Russia's response to U.S. sanctions. The list, declassified by Sen. Grassley, includes 39 officials, such as Comey, Biden, and McDonough, but it's unclear if they saw Flynn's unmasked info.
