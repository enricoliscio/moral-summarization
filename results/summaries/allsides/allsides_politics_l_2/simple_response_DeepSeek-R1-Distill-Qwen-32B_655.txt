Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about the Trump administration releasing a list of Obama officials who may have had access to NSA reports mentioning Michael Flynn. Flynn was involved in conversations with the Russian ambassador that the NSA intercepted. The article mentions that the list was declassified and made public, and it includes names like Comey, Biden, etc. It also notes that the list doesn't clarify who actually saw the unmasked information.

The author is critical of how Trump supporters are using this information to push the "Obamagate" narrative, which is a false claim that Obama was involved in smearing Flynn. The article explains that Flynn had his own issues, like lying to the FBI and having ties to foreign governments, which makes his situation more complicated.

I need to make sure the summary reflects that the author is pointing out the misuse of information by Trump supporters and the context of Flynn's own problematic actions. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include the main points without getting bogged down in too much detail.

I should start by stating that the Trump administration released a list of Obama officials with possible access to Flynn's NSA reports. Then mention that the list's release was used to promote the false "Obamagate" claim. I should note that there's no evidence Biden ordered the unmasking and that Flynn had his own issues. Also, include that the author is critical of the political misuse of the information.

Let me structure this step by step:

1. Trump administration releases list of Obama officials with access to Flynn's NSA reports.
2. The list's release is used to promote "Obamagate" claims, which are false.
3. No evidence that Biden ordered unmasking; Flynn had his own problems.
4. Author criticizes the misuse of information for political gain.

I should make sure each point is clear and concise, sticking to the moral framing that the author uses to critique the political manipulation of the information.

The Trump administration has released a list of Obama-era officials who may have accessed NSA reports mentioning Michael Flynn, sparking claims of "Obamagate," a false narrative alleging Obama's involvement in smearing Flynn. The list, though not proving Biden's involvement in unmasking Flynn, is being misused politically. Flynn's own issues, including lying to the FBI and ties to foreign governments, complicate the narrative. The author criticizes the politicization of the information, emphasizing Flynn's problematic actions and the lack of evidence against Biden. 

SUMMARY: The Trump administration released a list of Obama officials who may have accessed NSA reports about Michael Flynn, fueling false claims of Obama's involvement in targeting Flynn. While no evidence links Biden to ordering Flynn's unmasking, Trump supporters have exploited the information to promote "Obamagate." Flynn's own issues, including lying to the FBI and foreign ties, are highlighted, critiquing the political misuse of the information. END OF SUMMARY.
