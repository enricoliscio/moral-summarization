SUMMARY:

The Trump White House has released a list of 39 Obama administration officials who may have had access to NSA reports that identified Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, in conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The list includes FBI Director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and Vice President Joe Biden. However, the list does not indicate who actually requested Flynn's name to be "unmasked" or saw the report. The release of the list has been seized upon by Trump supporters to promote the false "Obamagate" claim that Obama was involved in an effort to unfairly smear Flynn. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and the investigation into Flynn's conversations with Kislyak was justified due to his suspicious activities and potential compromising ties to foreign states.

END OF SUMMARY.
