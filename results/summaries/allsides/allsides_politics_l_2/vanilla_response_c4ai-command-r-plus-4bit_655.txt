SUMMARY: The Trump White House released a list of Obama administration officials who may have received access to NSA reports identifying Michael Flynn, who later became Trump's national security adviser. The list was declassified at the request of acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and made public by Senator Charles Grassley. It includes 39 officials such as FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and Vice President Joe Biden. The list has been seized upon by promoters of Trump's "Obamagate" claim, which alleges that Obama unfairly smeared Flynn during the presidential transition. However, the list does not provide evidence of any wrongdoing by Obama officials, and the unmasking of Flynn was approved through normal protocols. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak but the Justice Department is now trying to drop the case. Supporters of Trump are misrepresenting the information to bolster their phony claim. Sen. Rand Paul, for example, falsely claimed that Biden ordered the unmasking of Flynn's private conversation.

END OF SUMMARY.
