Alright, I need to tackle this user's query. They provided a detailed news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, focusing on preserving the moral framing. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user wants me to identify all single words that carry moral framing in the article. They mentioned that this should be labeled as "STEP 1:" with each word on a new line starting with a *. I'll need to go through the article and pick out words that have a clear moral connotation, like "grim," "innocent," or "vilified."

Next, they want a summary of the article, making sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should ensure that the moral tone is maintained, reflecting the author's perspective on immigration and crime.

I should also consider the user's deeper needs. They might be looking for a clear, concise summary that highlights the moral arguments without losing the essence of the original article. They could be using this for a presentation, report, or to understand the key points quickly.

I'll start by reading through the article to identify the morally charged words. Words like "grim," "innocent," "tragedy," "vilified," "myth," "productive," "hero," "wasted," "smarter," "targeting," "justice," and "failure" stand out as they carry strong moral implications.

For the summary, I'll need to weave these words into a coherent narrative that reflects the article's main points. The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, the background of the suspect, the critique of linking immigration with crime, and the need for smarter immigration enforcement. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words to convey the author's stance on the issue.

I should also be careful to keep the summary within the word limit, ensuring it's both informative and concise. I'll structure the summary to first present the tragedy, then address the moral implications and the critique of immigration policies, and finally discuss the proposed solutions.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it flows well and accurately represents the original article's moral framing. This way, the user gets a clear, concise summary that maintains the ethical perspective presented in the news article.

**SUMMARY:**  
The tragic death of Kate Steinle, a young woman killed while walking with her father in San Francisco, has sparked discussions about immigration and crime. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a history of felony convictions, was arrested for her murder. However, the article emphasizes that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are often productive members of society. The piece critiques the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, citing research showing crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew. It also highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals rather than wasting resources on productive workers. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported multiple times, slipped through the cracks, highlighting the failure of current enforcement strategies. The article calls for targeting real threats to public safety and avoiding the vilification of undocumented immigrants based on the actions of a single individual.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
