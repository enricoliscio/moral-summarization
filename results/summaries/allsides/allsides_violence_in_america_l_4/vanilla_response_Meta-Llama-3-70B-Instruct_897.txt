SUMMARY:

A fatal shooting in San Francisco's pier has sparked controversy over illegal immigration. Kate Steinle, 31, was killed by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation and had seven felony convictions. However, the article argues that Lopez-Sanchez is not representative of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, who are mostly productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population has grown. The article criticizes the notion that undocumented immigrants are criminals, citing examples of heroic acts by undocumented immigrants. It also highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals rather than productive members of society. The government's new deportation priorities, which focus on convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats, are a step in the right direction.

END OF SUMMARY.
