SUMMARY: Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman from San Francisco, was fatally shot and killed last Wednesday night, allegedly by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation and had been deported five times previously. This tragic incident has sparked a moral debate about immigration and crime in the United States. Despite claims by some that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, research shows that crime rates have actually decreased as the immigrant population has grown. It is important to note that being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime, and most undocumented immigrants are productive members of society. Lopez-Sanchez, with his criminal record and random act of violence, is not representative of the overwhelming majority of immigrants. The focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting those who are a genuine threat to public safety, rather than wasting resources on productive members of communities. The recent announcement by the Department of Homeland Security to refocus deportation priorities on recent arrivals and serious criminals is a welcome step in this direction. However, the failure to detain Lopez-Sanchez and the ongoing legal battle over President Obama's executive action on immigration highlight the shortcomings of our current system. Steinle's death was a tragedy that should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants.
END OF SUMMARY.
