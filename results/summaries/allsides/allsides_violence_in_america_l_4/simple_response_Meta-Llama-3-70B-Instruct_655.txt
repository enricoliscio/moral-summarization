SUMMARY:

The recent fatal shooting of Kate Steinle in San Francisco by an undocumented Mexican immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, has sparked controversy. However, it's essential to separate this individual's heinous crime from the larger issue of undocumented immigration. Lopez-Sanchez's criminal history and repeated deportations make him an outlier, not representative of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. In fact, research shows that crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population has grown. The majority of undocumented immigrants come to the US to work and provide for their families. The focus should be on smarter immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals and recent arrivals, rather than deporting productive members of society. The government's new deportation priorities and President Obama's proposed executive action on immigration could have made a difference in this case. It's crucial to avoid vilifying all undocumented immigrants based on the actions of one individual. END OF SUMMARY.
