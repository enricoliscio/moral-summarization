SUMMARY: As the US prepared for July Fourth weekend, news broke of a fatal shooting in San Francisco, where Kate Steinle, 31, was randomly shot while walking with her father. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, is an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a criminal record. This incident has sparked discussions about immigration and crime. While Lopez-Sanchez's actions were horrific, he does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants in the US, who are productive members of society. Research shows that increased illegal immigration does not lead to more crime. The focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting those who pose a threat to public safety. The Department of Homeland Security's recent decision to prioritize convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is a step in the right direction. However, the current system failed Kate Steinle, and the tragedy should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants.

END OF SUMMARY.
