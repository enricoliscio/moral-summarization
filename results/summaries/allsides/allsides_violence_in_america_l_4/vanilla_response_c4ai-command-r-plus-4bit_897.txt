SUMMARY: On Wednesday night, Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot while walking with her father on a busy pier in San Francisco. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, is a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation and had been deported five times previously. This incident has sparked a debate about immigration and crime in the United States. While some argue that Lopez-Sanchez is a symbol of the dangers of illegal immigration, the article presents research showing that crime rates have actually decreased as the immigrant population has grown. It also highlights the fact that most undocumented immigrants are productive members of society and are not criminals. The article argues that the focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting those who are a real threat to public safety. It also mentions that the Department of Homeland Security is rethinking its deportation priorities and that President Obama's proposed executive action on immigration could have potentially made a difference in this case. The tragic death of Kate Steinle should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants.
END OF SUMMARY.
