SUMMARY:

A tragic shooting occurred in San Francisco, resulting in the death of 31-year-old Kate Steinle. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant, was arrested and has a history of seven felony convictions. However, the article argues that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the majority of immigrants, who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population has grown. The article criticizes the notion that undocumented immigrants are criminals, pointing out that being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime. It also highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals and recent arrivals, rather than deporting productive members of society. The article concludes that Lopez-Sanchez's case is an example of the need for better immigration enforcement, rather than a symbol of the dangers of undocumented immigration.
