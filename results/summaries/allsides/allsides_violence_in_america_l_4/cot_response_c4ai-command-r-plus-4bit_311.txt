SUMMARY: A young woman, Kate Steinle, was fatally shot on a San Francisco pier, allegedly by a Mexican immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who was in the country without documentation. This tragic event has sparked a moral debate about immigration and crime in the United States. While some use this incident as proof of the dangers posed by undocumented immigrants, the article argues that such a view is a myth and a form of vilification by false association. Research shows that crime rates have actually decreased as the immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, has grown. It is important to note that being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime. The article acknowledges that Lopez-Sanchez is a dangerous individual with a criminal history, but emphasizes that he does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants who are productive members of society. The takeaway from this episode is the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement. Instead of wasting time and resources on productive members of communities, the focus should be on targeting those who are a genuine threat to public safety, such as convicted criminals and recent border crossers. The article concludes that the current system failed Kate Steinle and that a more targeted approach to immigration enforcement is needed to prevent such tragedies in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
