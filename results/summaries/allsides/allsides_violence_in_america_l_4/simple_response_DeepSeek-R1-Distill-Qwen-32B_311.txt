Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Kate Steinle's murder and the subsequent discussion on immigration policies. The author is critical of using this incident to generalize about undocumented immigrants. I should highlight the main points: the crime, the suspect's background, the argument against linking immigration with crime, the need for smarter enforcement, and the call for not stereotyping immigrants. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral perspective is clearâ€”that one bad actor shouldn't define a whole group. I'll structure it by first stating the incident, then the counterarguments, and end with the call for better policy. Let me make sure each sentence adds value without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot while walking with her father in San Francisco, has sparked debate over immigration policies. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felony convictions, has been arrested. However, the article argues against using this case to generalize about undocumented immigrants, emphasizing that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the broader immigrant population. Research shows that crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population, including undocumented individuals, has grown. The author criticizes the idea that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, pointing out that most undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to work and improve their lives. The article also highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals rather than productive community members. It notes that Lopez-Sanchez had been deported multiple times but remained in the country, highlighting flaws in the current system. The author advocates for a shift in priorities to target real threats to public safety, rather thanvilifying all undocumented immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
