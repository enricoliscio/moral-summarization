SUMMARY:

The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman who was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation. Lopez-Sanchez had seven felony convictions and had been deported five times before. The article argues that Lopez-Sanchez's actions do not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population has grown. The article also criticizes the focus on deporting undocumented immigrants, citing the high cost of deportation and the fact that Lopez-Sanchez was able to re-enter the country despite being deported multiple times. Instead, the article suggests that the government should focus on targeting serious criminals and recent border crossers. The article concludes that Steinle's death was a tragedy, but it should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants.
