Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should include as many of those as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, killed by Juan Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a criminal history. The author argues against linking all undocumented immigrants to crime, citing statistics and examples of immigrants contributing positively. They also critique current immigration enforcement policies, suggesting they're inefficient and not targeting the right people.

I need to highlight the moral elements: the tragedy, the individual's criminal past, the critique of generalizing immigrants as criminals, the cost of deportation, and the need for smarter enforcement. I'll make sure to use words like "tragedy," "felony," "crime," "deportation," "myth," "research," "vilified," etc.

I'll structure the summary to first present the event, then the author's argument against generalization, mention the positive contributions of immigrants, critique the enforcement policies, and conclude with the need for better targeting of dangerous individuals.

I should keep each point brief, ensuring the summary flows logically and stays within the word limit. Also, I need to avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the key moral terms and points from the article.

SUMMARY: The tragic death of Kate Steinle, fatally shot by Juan Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felony convictions, has sparked debate over immigration and crime. Lopez-Sanchez, who illegally reentered the U.S. after multiple deportations, is accused of a violent crime, but the author argues he does not represent the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Research shows crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population grew, debunking the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. The author criticizes the narrative that all undocumented immigrants are criminals, pointing out that most come to work and provide for their families. The article highlights the inefficiency of current immigration enforcement, which often targets productive community members while allowing dangerous individuals like Lopez-Sanchez to slip through. The U.S. spends heavily on immigration enforcement, yet the system failed to protect Steinle. The author advocates for smarter enforcement, focusing on serious criminals, recent arrivals, and terrorism threats, rather than deporting all undocumented immigrants. Lopez-Sanchezâ€™s case underscores the need to prioritize public safety over broad deportation efforts. The tragedy should notvilify all undocumented immigrants, as they do not deserve blame for the actions of one man. END OF SUMMARY.
