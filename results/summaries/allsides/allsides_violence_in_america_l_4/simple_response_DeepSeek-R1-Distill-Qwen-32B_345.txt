Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about Kate Steinle's death, a tragic event where an undocumented immigrant, Juan Lopez-Sanchez, was arrested. The author emphasizes that Lopez-Sanchez is not representative of all undocumented immigrants, pointing out that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low. They argue against the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, citing research that crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew. 

The author also mentions that being undocumented isn't a crime but a civil infraction and that most immigrants come to work. They compare this to mass shootings committed by young white men, highlighting that not all fit that stereotype. The article then discusses the inefficiency of current immigration enforcement, noting that Lopez-Sanchez had been deported multiple times but was still in the country. 

The author suggests that the government should focus on deporting serious criminals and recent arrivals rather than productive community members. They mention the Department of Homeland Security's shift in priorities and Obama's proposed executive action, which aimed to target criminals. The article concludes by stating that Steinle's tragedy shouldn't lead to vilifying all undocumented immigrants.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral points intact. I should highlight the tragedy, Lopez-Sanchez's background, the argument against generalizing immigrants, the statistics on crime, the call for smarter enforcement, and the conclusion that not all undocumented immigrants are dangerous.

Let me structure the summary step by step, ensuring each key point is included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felony convictions. The author emphasizes that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are often productive members of society. The piece challenges the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to higher crime rates, citing research showing crime rates declined as the immigrant population grew. It also notes that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low. The author argues that the current immigration enforcement system is flawed, as Lopez-Sanchez, despite multiple deportations, remained in the country. The article advocates for smarter enforcement targeting serious criminals rather than productive community members, such as gardeners and maids. It highlights the need to focus on recent arrivals and felons, rather than wasting resources on low-priority cases. The author concludes that while Lopez-Sanchez should not have been free, the tragedy should not lead to vilifying all undocumented immigrants, who are not inherently dangerous.  
END OF SUMMARY.
