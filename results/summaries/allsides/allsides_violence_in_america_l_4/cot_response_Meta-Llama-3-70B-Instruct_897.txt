SUMMARY:
The senseless killing of Kate Steinle, 31, by a dangerous individual, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation, has sparked outrage. Lopez-Sanchez, a convicted felon with seven prior felony convictions, including four for drug offenses, does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants who are productive members of society. It's a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, as research shows that crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population has grown. The government's current approach to immigration enforcement is flawed, wasting resources on deporting non-criminal immigrants while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slip through the cracks. A smarter approach, focusing on serious criminals and recent arrivals, is needed to ensure public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
