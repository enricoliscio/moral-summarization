Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Kate Steinle's murder in San Francisco by Juan Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felonies. It mentions that he had been deported multiple times but kept coming back. The article argues that he doesn't represent all undocumented immigrants, who are mostly law-abiding and contribute positively. It also talks about how increased illegal immigration doesn't lead to more crime, citing research from the Immigration Policy Center. The author criticizes the current immigration enforcement policies for targeting low-risk individuals instead of focusing on dangerous criminals. They mention that deporting everyone isn't the solution and that resources should be used more effectively. The article also touches on the government's recent shift in priorities to focus on serious criminals, recent arrivals, and terrorism threats. It points out that Lopez-Sanchez's case shows a failure in the system, as he was released despite his criminal history. The conclusion is that undocumented immigrants shouldn't bevilified for the actions of a few dangerous individuals.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words. I should include the key points: Steinle's murder, Lopez-Sanchez's background, the argument against linking immigration with crime, the need for smarter enforcement, and the conclusion that undocumented immigrants aren't all criminals. I should structure it clearly, maybe starting with the event, then the context, the argument, and the proposed solution. I need to avoid getting bogged down in too many details but capture the essence of each point. Let me try to outline the main sections: introduction of the event, Lopez-Sanchez's background, the argument against generalizing, the need for better enforcement, and the conclusion about not vilifying immigrants. I'll make sure each part is concise. I should also check for any specific statistics or points mentioned, like the cost of deportations or the trend of lower immigration from Mexico. That should help keep the summary accurate and within the word limit.
