SUMMARY: Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, was fatally shot in San Francisco by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation and had a history of felony convictions. This tragic incident has sparked a moral debate about immigration and crime. While some portray Lopez-Sanchez as a symbol of the dangers of illegal immigration, the author argues that he is not representative of the overwhelming majority of immigrants, and that increased illegal immigration does not lead to more crime. The article highlights the wastefulness and ineffectiveness of current immigration enforcement practices and calls for smarter and better enforcement that targets those who are a genuine threat to public safety. The death of Steinle is a tragedy that should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants. The moral framing of this article centers around words like shot, arrested, death, felony, crime, convictions, offenses, immigration, myth, wrong, rescue, wasted, enforcement, slipped, move, threat, focusing, efforts, threats, erred, released, freed, go, action, allowing, failed, tragedy, and vilified.

END OF SUMMARY.
