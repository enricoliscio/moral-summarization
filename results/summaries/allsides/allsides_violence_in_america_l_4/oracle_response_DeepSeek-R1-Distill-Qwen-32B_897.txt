Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article from CNN and a list of morally framed words. My task is to summarize the article while preserving the moral framing, using as many of the provided words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and follow a specific format.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felonies. The author argues against the notion that undocumented immigrants are inherently criminals, pointing out that most are law-abiding and contribute positively. They also critique the current immigration enforcement policies, suggesting they are ineffective and misdirected.

Next, I should identify the key morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "shot," "arrested," "death," "felony," "crime," "convictions," "deportation," "myth," "research," "wrong," "murder," "overlook," "ignore," "rescued," "deporting," "wasted," "take," "enforcement," "slipped," "move," "threat," "focusing," "efforts," "threats," "erred," "released," "freed," "go," "action," "allowing," "failed," "tragedy," "vilified," "association" are important.

I need to ensure that the summary includes these words where appropriate, without forcing them in. The summary should flow naturally while highlighting the moral aspects, such as the tragedy, the failure of immigration enforcement, and the incorrect association of undocumented immigrants with crime.

I'll start by outlining the main points: the tragedy of Kate Steinle's death, Lopez-Sanchez's background, the myth about immigration and crime, the need for smarter enforcement, and the failure of current policies. Then, I'll incorporate the moral words into each section.

I should also keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise. I'll make sure each sentence conveys a key point without unnecessary details.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to begin with the tragedy, move to the critique of the immigration enforcement, mention the need for smarter policies, and conclude with the call to avoid vilifying immigrants. I'll end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was shot while walking with her father in San Francisco, has sparked discussions about immigration and crime. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felony convictions, including drug offenses, is accused of her murder. However, the author argues that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., many of whom are law-abiding and contribute positively to society. The article challenges the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, citing research showing crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population grew. The author criticizes the current immigration enforcement system, which often targets productive workers while allowing dangerous individuals like Lopez-Sanchez to slip through. The government's recent shift in deportation priorities, focusing on serious criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats, is seen as a step in the right direction. The article also highlights the failure of immigration enforcement, as Lopez-Sanchez had been deported multiple times but remained in the country. The author emphasizes that undocumented immigrants should not be vilified for the actions of a few, urging a more targeted and effective approach to immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
