Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first. It's about Kate Steinle's murder in San Francisco and the arrest of Juan Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a criminal history. The author is arguing against the notion that undocumented immigrants are criminals, pointing out that Lopez-Sanchez is an exception. They mention that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low and that most immigrants are law-abiding. The article also criticizes the current immigration enforcement policies, suggesting they're ineffective and should focus more on serious criminals rather than deporting productive members of society. There's a point about the cost of deportations and how resources are misused. The author supports Obama's executive action for better targeting of enforcement. The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, under 200 words, and maintain the moral stance presented.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the tragic murder of Kate Steinle by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a violent criminal history, highlighting the moral framing that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants. The author argues that illegal immigration does not lead to increased crime, citing research showing falling crime rates despite a growing immigrant population. Lopez-Sanchez, with seven felony convictions, is an outlier, and the article criticizes the current immigration enforcement system for failing to target dangerous individuals effectively. It emphasizes the need for smarter enforcement, focusing on serious criminals rather than productive community members. The author also notes the high cost of deportations and supports Obama's proposed executive action to prioritize deporting dangerous individuals. The article concludes that the tragedy should notvilify all undocumented immigrants, as they are mostly law-abiding and contribute positively to society. END OF SUMMARY.
