Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary should not only be concise but also highlight the ethical and moral points the author made.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Kate Steinle's death, the suspect's background, and the broader implications on immigration policies. The author argues against linking undocumented immigrants to crime, citing statistics and examples of productive immigrants.

I should start by mentioning the tragic event and the suspect's illegal status and criminal history. Then, the author clarifies that he doesn't represent all immigrants, so I need to include that point to avoid stigmatization.

Next, the article discusses the myth that more illegal immigration leads to more crime, supported by research. I'll summarize that part, emphasizing that crime rates actually decreased as the immigrant population grew.

The author also points out the inefficiency of current immigration enforcement, focusing on the costs and resources wasted on deporting productive workers instead of targeting serious criminals. I should include the $12,500 cost per deportation and the shift in priorities by the Department of Homeland Security.

Additionally, the article mentions President Obama's executive action, which could have helped target criminals better. I'll note that the system failed Kate Steinle despite spending more on enforcement.

Finally, the conclusion should stress that one criminal doesn't represent all undocumented immigrants and that smarter enforcement is needed. I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll condense each point without losing the moral message.

I should structure the summary to flow from the event to the broader implications, ensuring each moral point is clear. I'll avoid technical jargon to keep it accessible. Let me draft this, making sure to highlight the key moral arguments against stigmatization and the need for effective enforcement.

SUMMARY: A tragic incident in San Francisco, where Kate Steinle was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a violent criminal history, has sparked debate about immigration and crime. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported multiple times, is accused of a heinous crime and has seven felony convictions. However, the author argues that he does not represent the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., most of whom are law-abiding and contribute positively to society. The article highlights that illegal immigration is at a 40-year low and that crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population has grown. The author criticizes the myth linking increased immigration to higher crime, citing research and examples of undocumented heroes, like a man who rescued a family during Superstorm Sandy. The current immigration enforcement system is flawed, wasting resources on deporting productive workers while letting dangerous criminals like Lopez-Sanchez slip through. The Department of Homeland Security's shift to prioritize deporting serious criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is a step in the right direction. The article concludes that all undocumented immigrants should not be vilified for the actions of one dangerous individual, and smarter immigration enforcement is needed to protect public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
