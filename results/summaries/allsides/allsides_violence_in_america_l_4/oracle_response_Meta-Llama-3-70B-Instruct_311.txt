SUMMARY:

A tragic incident occurred in San Francisco when Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot while walking with her father on a busy pier. The alleged perpetrator, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who reentered the country illegally after being deported, has seven felony convictions, including four for drug offenses. However, this incident does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants, who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population has grown. It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Lopez-Sanchez is a dangerous individual who should not have been free, and his actions should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants. Deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer, and our country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement. The government's new focus on deporting convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is a step in the right direction.

END OF SUMMARY.
