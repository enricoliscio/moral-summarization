SUMMARY:

The tragic death of Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, at the hands of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant with a criminal record, has sparked outrage. However, it's essential to separate this individual's heinous act from the broader narrative of undocumented immigrants. Research shows that increased illegal immigration does not lead to more crime, and most undocumented immigrants come to the US to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families. Deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the solution, as Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times and still managed to re-enter the country. Instead, the focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals and recent arrivals. The government's recent move to rethink deportation priorities is a step in the right direction. It's crucial to avoid vilifying all undocumented immigrants by false association and to address the root causes of the issue.
