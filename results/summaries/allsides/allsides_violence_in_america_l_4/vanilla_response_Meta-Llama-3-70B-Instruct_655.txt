SUMMARY:

A tragic incident occurred in San Francisco when Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation. Lopez-Sanchez had seven felony convictions, including four for drug offenses, and had been deported five times. However, he does not represent the majority of immigrants who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates fell in the US as the immigrant population grew from 1990 to 2010. The article argues that deporting undocumented immigrants is not the solution, as Lopez-Sanchez's case shows that it is possible for criminals to slip through the cracks. Instead, the focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals and recent arrivals. The Department of Homeland Security's recent announcement to rethink deportation priorities is a step in the right direction.
