SUMMARY: Kate Steinle's death was a tragedy. She was fatally shot, and her alleged murderer, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a criminal record, was arrested. This incident has sparked discussions about immigration and crime. Despite claims that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, research shows that crime rates have actually decreased as the immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, has grown. Lopez-Sanchez is not representative of the majority of immigrants, who are productive members of society. The focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting those who are a real threat to public safety. Deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer, as it wastes resources and fails to address the root causes of criminal activity. The government's recent move to refocus deportation priorities on recent arrivals and serious criminals is a step in the right direction. However, the current system failed Kate Steinle, as Lopez-Sanchez should not have been free.
