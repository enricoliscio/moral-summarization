Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified two steps: first, identifying all single words that are morally framed, and second, writing a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with STEP 1, I'll go through the article to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "grim," "randomly," "innocent," "felony," "dangerous," "myth," "vilified," "false association," "criminal," "productivity," "heroes," "tragedy," "failed," "justice," "fairness," and "equality" stand out. These words convey judgments or evaluations, so they fit the moral framing category.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less. I should focus on the main points: the tragic event, the moral implications of Lopez-Sanchez's actions, the critique of the immigration system, and the call for smarter enforcement. I'll make sure to include the identified morally framed words to maintain the author's tone.

I'll structure the summary by first recounting the incident, then discussing Lopez-Sanchez's background and the broader implications. I'll address the myth about immigration and crime, mention the heroism of some immigrants, and critique the current enforcement strategies. Finally, I'll touch on the proposed executive action and the system's failure, emphasizing the need for a more targeted approach.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to make sure it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms without being redundant. This way, the summary will effectively convey the article's message while preserving the moral framing as required.

**SUMMARY:**  

The tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot while walking with her father, has sparked moral and immigration debates. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felony convictions, including drug offenses, has been arrested. However, the article emphasizes that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., many of whom are productive members of society. The author challenges the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, citing research showing crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew. The article also critiques the current immigration enforcement system, which often targets low-risk individuals while allowing dangerous criminals like Lopez-Sanchez to remain free. The governmentâ€™s recent shift in deportation priorities to focus on serious criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is seen as a step in the right direction. The tragedy highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement to protect public safety and fairness.
