SUMMARY: Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, was shot and killed in San Francisco, allegedly by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a criminal record. This tragic incident has sparked a moral debate about immigration and crime. While some portray Lopez-Sanchez as a symbol of the dangers of illegal immigration, the author argues that he is not representative of the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are productive members of society. Research shows that increased illegal immigration does not lead to more crime. The article criticizes the current immigration enforcement system for wasting resources on deporting productive members of communities while failing to prevent criminals like Lopez-Sanchez from re-entering the country. The focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement that targets individuals who pose a genuine threat to public safety. The government's recent move to prioritize the deportation of convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is a step in the right direction. However, the system ultimately failed Kate Steinle, as Lopez-Sanchez should not have been free to commit this horrific crime. The article concludes by emphasizing that not all undocumented immigrants should be vilified due to the actions of one individual.
END OF SUMMARY.
