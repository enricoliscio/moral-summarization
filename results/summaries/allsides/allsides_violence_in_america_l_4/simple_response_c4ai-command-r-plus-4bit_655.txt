SUMMARY: The tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot by an undocumented Mexican immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, has sparked discussions about immigration and crime in the United States. Despite Lopez-Sanchez's criminal record and illegal re-entry into the country, he does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are productive members of society. Research shows that increased illegal immigration does not lead to more crime, and most undocumented immigrants come to the US seeking a better life. The media often overlooks stories of undocumented immigrants who are heroes, instead focusing on negative stereotypes. The takeaway from this incident is not that we need more immigration enforcement, but smarter and better enforcement that targets those who are a genuine threat to public safety. The government's recent decision to refocus its enforcement efforts on convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is a step in the right direction. Lopez-Sanchez should have been behind bars, but the system failed, and an innocent life was lost. However, vilifying all undocumented immigrants based on the actions of one individual is unjust and immoral.

END OF SUMMARY.
