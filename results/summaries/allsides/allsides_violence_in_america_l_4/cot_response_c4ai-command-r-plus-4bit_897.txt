SUMMARY: 
The tragic and random death of Kate Steinle, shot by an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a criminal record, has brought to light the complex issue of immigration and crime in the United States. While some may vilify all undocumented immigrants as criminals, research shows that this is a myth. In fact, most undocumented immigrants are productive members of society who come to the country in search of a better life for themselves and their families. The real issue lies in the failure of our immigration enforcement system, which has wasted time and resources targeting law-abiding immigrants instead of focusing on serious criminals like Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported five times and yet remained in the country. This tragic event highlights the need for smarter and more targeted immigration enforcement that prioritizes public safety without unjustly targeting all undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security's recent move to refocus its deportation priorities on recent arrivals and serious criminals is a step in the right direction. However, more needs to be done to prevent immoral individuals like Lopez-Sanchez from slipping through the cracks and causing harm. The failure to keep him behind bars is a waste of taxpayers' money and has resulted in the unjust death of an innocent woman. END OF SUMMARY.
