Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about Kate Steinle's death and the circumstances around it. She was killed by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who's an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. He had multiple felony convictions, including drug offenses, and had been deported multiple times before. The article mentions that Lopez-Sanchez shouldn't represent all undocumented immigrants because most are law-abiding and contribute positively to society.

The article also talks about how illegal immigration doesn't lead to more crime, citing research from the Immigration Policy Center. It points out that crime rates actually decreased as the immigrant population grew. It criticizes the media for using this incident to generalize about undocumented immigrants being criminals, while ignoring positive stories, like the undocumented hero during Superstorm Sandy.

The main points seem to be: Lopez-Sanchez is a dangerous individual, but he doesn't represent all undocumented immigrants. The current immigration enforcement isn't effective because it's targeting low-risk individuals instead of serious criminals. The article suggests that the government should focus on deporting serious criminals and recent arrivals, not hardworking immigrants. It also mentions Obama's executive action, which aimed to shift priorities but was blocked legally.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these key points: the tragedy, Lopez-Sanchez's background, the argument against generalizing undocumented immigrants, the effectiveness of immigration enforcement, and the proposed changes in priorities.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with the incident, then Lopez-Sanchez's history, the argument that he's an outlier, the statistics about crime rates, the media's role, the need for smarter enforcement, and the mention of Obama's action. Make sure it's all clear and within the word limit.
