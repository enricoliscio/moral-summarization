SUMMARY:

The tragic death of Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, at the hands of an undocumented Mexican immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, has sparked outrage. However, it's essential to separate this horrific crime from the broader issue of undocumented immigration. Lopez-Sanchez, with seven felony convictions, is a dangerous individual who should not have been free. Research shows that increased illegal immigration does not lead to more crime, and most undocumented immigrants come to the US to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families. The focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals and recent arrivals, rather than deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible. The government's new deportation priorities and President Obama's proposed executive action on immigration could have made a difference in this case. It's crucial not to vilify all undocumented immigrants by false association, and instead, work towards a more effective and humane immigration system. END OF SUMMARY.
