SUMMARY: A tragic event occurred in San Francisco when Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot while walking with her father on a busy pier. The alleged perpetrator, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant with seven felony convictions, was arrested. However, this incident does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew from 1990 to 2010. It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Lopez-Sanchez is a dangerous individual who should not have been free, and his case highlights the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement. The government's new focus on deporting convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is a step in the right direction. The tragic death of Kate Steinle was a result of the alleged action of one man, and it is wrong to vilify all undocumented immigrants by false association. END OF SUMMARY.
