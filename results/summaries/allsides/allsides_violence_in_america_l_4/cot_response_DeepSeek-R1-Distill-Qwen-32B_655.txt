Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed article about Kate Steinle's murder and the subsequent discussion on immigration policies. The user wants me to identify the morally framed words and then write a concise summary that includes those terms.

Starting with STEP 1, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "grim," "randomly," "federal felony," "horrific," "violent," "myth," "crime," "deportation," "felony convictions," "vilified," etc. These words are charged with moral implications, either positive or negative.

Next, for the summary, I have to make sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible without making it too long. The summary should capture the main points: the tragic event, the suspect's background, the critique of linking immigration to crime, and the call for smarter enforcement. I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words and flows naturally, maintaining the moral perspective presented in the original text.

I should also check that the summary doesn't just list facts but conveys the moral stance against generalizing immigrants based on one criminal's actions. It's important to highlight that Lopez-Sanchez is an outlier and that immigration enforcement should target serious criminals, not all undocumented individuals.

I need to be careful not to include any words that aren't morally framed and ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's arguments. Also, I should avoid any personal opinions and stick strictly to summarizing the given content while preserving the moral framing.

After identifying all the morally charged words, I can structure the summary by first stating the tragedy, then discussing the suspect's background, followed by the critique of immigration policies, and concluding with the need for smarter enforcement. This structure should effectively convey the moral message without being too lengthy.

I should also make sure that the summary doesn't misrepresent the article. For example, it's crucial to mention that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low to counter the myth that more immigration leads to more crime. Including that Lopez-Sanchez had multiple deportations and felony convictions shows that he's an exception, not representative of all immigrants.

Finally, I'll wrap up by emphasizing that the solution isn't mass deportations but targeting the truly dangerous individuals, which ties back to the moral framing of fairness and efficiency in enforcement.

* Randomly  
* Federal felony  
* Horrific  
* Violent  
* Myth  
* Crime  
* Deportation  
* Felony convictions  
* Vilified

* Failed  
* Vilified  

**SUMMARY:**  
The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a history of felony convictions. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported multiple times, is described as a dangerous individual, but the article emphasizes that he does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are productive members of society. The piece critiques the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, citing research showing crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew. It also highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals rather than wasting resources on productive workers. The article argues that deporting everyone is not the solution, as Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks despite his history. The government's recent shift to prioritize deporting recent arrivals and felons is seen as a step in the right direction. The tragedy of Steinleâ€™s death should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants, as they are not a homogeneous threat. END OF SUMMARY.
