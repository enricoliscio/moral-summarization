SUMMARY:
A tragic incident occurred in San Francisco when Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation and had a history of seven felony convictions. However, Lopez-Sanchez's actions do not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants, who are productive members of society. In fact, research shows that crime rates fell in the US as the immigrant population grew. The incident highlights the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals like Lopez-Sanchez, rather than deporting undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes. The government's new deportation priorities, which focus on convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats, are a step in the right direction. The tragic death of Kate Steinle was a result of a failure in the system, but it should not lead to the vilification of all undocumented immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
