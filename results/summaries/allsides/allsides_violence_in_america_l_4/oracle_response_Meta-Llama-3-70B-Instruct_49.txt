SUMMARY:

The tragic death of Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, at the hands of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant with a history of felony convictions, has sparked outrage. However, it is essential to separate this horrific crime from the broader issue of illegal immigration. Research shows that crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population has grown, debunking the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Lopez-Sanchez's actions are not representative of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, who are productive members of society. In fact, many undocumented immigrants are heroes, like the one who rescued a mother and child during Superstorm Sandy. The real issue is the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals like Lopez-Sanchez, rather than deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible. The government's recent move to rethink deportation priorities is a step in the right direction. It's time to stop vilifying all undocumented immigrants by false association and instead target those who pose a real threat to public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
