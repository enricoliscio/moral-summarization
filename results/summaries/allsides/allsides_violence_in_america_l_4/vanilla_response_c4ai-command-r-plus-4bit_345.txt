SUMMARY: In San Francisco, Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant in the country without documentation and with a criminal record. This incident has sparked debates about immigration and crime, with some using it as an example of the dangers of undocumented immigrants. However, research shows that crime rates have actually decreased as the immigrant population has grown. It is important to note that being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime, and most undocumented immigrants are productive members of society. The focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting those who are a real threat to public safety, rather than wasting resources on productive members of communities. The Department of Homeland Security's recent announcement to refocus deportation priorities is a positive step, but more needs to be done to prevent tragedies like Steinle's death. This incident should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants.

END OF SUMMARY.
