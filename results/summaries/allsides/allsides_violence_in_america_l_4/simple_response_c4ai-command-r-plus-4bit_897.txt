SUMMARY: As the United States prepared for July Fourth weekend, the tragic news emerged that 31-year-old Kate Steinle had been fatally shot while walking with her father on a busy pier in San Francisco. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, is an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a criminal record, who had been deported multiple times. This incident has sparked a moral debate about immigration and crime. Despite claims by some, research shows that illegal immigration does not lead to more crime. The vast majority of undocumented immigrants are productive members of society, seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Vilifying all undocumented immigrants due to the actions of one individual is immoral and ignores the contributions of many heroic undocumented immigrants. The real issue is the need for smarter and more targeted immigration enforcement. Resources should be focused on those who pose a genuine threat to public safety, rather than wasting time and money on productive members of communities. The recent re-evaluation of deportation priorities by the Department of Homeland Security is a positive step towards a more effective and moral immigration system. 

END OF SUMMARY.
