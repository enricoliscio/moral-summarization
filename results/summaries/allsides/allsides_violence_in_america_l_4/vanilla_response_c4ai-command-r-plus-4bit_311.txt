SUMMARY: A young woman, Kate Steinle, was fatally shot in San Francisco by an undocumented Mexican immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who had previously been deported five times. This incident has sparked a debate about immigration and crime in the United States. While some argue that Lopez-Sanchez is representative of undocumented immigrants as criminals, the article emphasizes that he is not indicative of the entire population. Research shows that crime rates have actually decreased as the immigrant population has grown. It is important to note that being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime, and most undocumented immigrants are productive members of society. The article also highlights the cost of deporting individuals, with each deportation costing $12,500, and the ineffectiveness of current immigration enforcement strategies. The Department of Homeland Security's recent decision to refocus deportation priorities on convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is a positive step towards smarter and better immigration enforcement. This incident underscores the need for more targeted enforcement efforts to protect public safety. The failure to detain Lopez-Sanchez, despite his criminal history, highlights the flaws in the current system and the need for better solutions. END OF SUMMARY.
