SUMMARY:

A senseless tragedy occurred in San Francisco when Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot while walking with her father on a busy pier. The alleged perpetrator, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who re-entered the country illegally after being deported, has seven other felony convictions, including four for drug offenses. However, Lopez-Sanchez's actions do not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates fell in the US as the immigrant population grew from 1990 to 2010. Being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime. Most undocumented immigrants come to the US to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families. The government's focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals like Lopez-Sanchez, rather than deporting productive members of society. The Department of Homeland Security's new deportation priorities, focusing on convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats, is a step in the right direction.
