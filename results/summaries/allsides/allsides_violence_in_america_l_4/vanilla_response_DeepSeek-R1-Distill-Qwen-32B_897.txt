Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Kate Steinle's murder and the subsequent discussion on immigration. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

First, Kate Steinle was killed in San Francisco by Juan Lopez-Sanchez, who is an undocumented immigrant with a history of felonies. The article points out that he's a dangerous individual but doesn't represent all undocumented immigrants. It mentions that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low, so he's not indicative of the broader trend.

The article also discusses how increased illegal immigration doesn't lead to more crime, citing research from the Immigration Policy Center. It challenges the idea that undocumented immigrants are criminals, referencing other cases where they've acted heroically.

Another point is about the cost and inefficiency of current immigration enforcement. Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times, costing a lot of taxpayer money, yet he was still in the country. The article suggests that focusing on serious criminals and recent arrivals would be more effective than current enforcement practices.

It also touches on President Obama's executive action, which was aimed at deporting criminals but got tied up legally. The conclusion is that while Lopez-Sanchez should not have been free, the system failed Kate Steinle, and all undocumented immigrants shouldn't be blamed for his actions.

So, putting this together, the summary should cover the tragedy, Lopez-Sanchez's background, the argument against generalizing undocumented immigrants, the need for smarter enforcement, and the failed system aspect. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise, hitting all these key points without going into too much detail.

SUMMARY: Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot in San Francisco by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of seven felony convictions, including drug offenses. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported five times, is accused of a violent crime. However, he does not represent the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., many of whom are law-abiding and contribute positively to society. Research shows crime rates decreased as the immigrant population grew, contradicting claims that undocumented immigrants increase crime. The article highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals rather than wasting resources on productive community members. Lopez-Sanchez's case underscores the failure of current enforcement policies, as he slipped through the system despite multiple deportations. The government recently announced a shift in priorities to target criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats. Kate Steinle's tragic death should notvilify all undocumented immigrants, as they are not responsible for one man's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
