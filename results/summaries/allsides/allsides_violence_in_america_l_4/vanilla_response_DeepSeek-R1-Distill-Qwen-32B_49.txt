Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about Kate Steinle's murder in San Francisco, the suspect being an undocumented immigrant with a history of felonies. It mentions that illegal immigration isn't linked to higher crime rates, citing research from the Immigration Policy Center. The author argues against the stereotype that undocumented immigrants are criminals, pointing out examples of their positive contributions. There's a focus on the need for smarter immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals rather than all undocumented individuals. The article also critiques the current enforcement strategies and mentions the Obama administration's proposed executive actions. Finally, it emphasizes that Steinle's tragedy shouldn't generalize all undocumented immigrants as dangerous. I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the main points without getting bogged down in details.

SUMMARY:  
The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot in San Francisco by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felony convictions. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported multiple times, is accused of a violent crime, but the article emphasizes that he does not represent the millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., most of whom are law-abiding and contribute positively to society. Research shows that crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population, including undocumented individuals, has grown. The article critiques the notion that undocumented immigrants are inherently criminals, citing examples of immigrants who have acted heroically. It argues that deporting all undocumented immigrants is not the solution, as resources are often wasted on low-priority cases while dangerous individuals like Lopez-Sanchez slip through the cracks. The Department of Homeland Security's shift in focusing enforcement on serious criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats is seen as a step in the right direction. The article concludes that Steinle's death, while a tragedy, should not be used tovilify all undocumented immigrants, as they are not a homogeneous group.  
END OF SUMMARY.
