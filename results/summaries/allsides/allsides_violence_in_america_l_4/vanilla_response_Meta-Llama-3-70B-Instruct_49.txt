SUMMARY:

A fatal shooting of a 31-year-old woman, Kate Steinle, in San Francisco has sparked controversy over illegal immigration. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant, was arrested and has a history of seven felony convictions. However, the article argues that Lopez-Sanchez does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population has grown. The article also highlights that deporting undocumented immigrants is not the solution, as Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times before. Instead, the focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals and recent arrivals. The Department of Homeland Security's recent announcement to rethink deportation priorities is a step in the right direction. The article concludes that all undocumented immigrants should not be vilified by false association with Lopez-Sanchez's actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
