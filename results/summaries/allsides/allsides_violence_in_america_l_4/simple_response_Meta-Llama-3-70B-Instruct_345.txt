SUMMARY:

The tragic death of Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, at the hands of an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a criminal record, should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants. The perpetrator, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, is a dangerous individual who should not have been free, but he does not represent the majority of immigrants who are productive members of society. Research shows that increased illegal immigration does not lead to more crime, and most undocumented immigrants come to the US to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families. The focus should be on smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals and recent arrivals, rather than deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible. The government's new deportation priorities and President Obama's proposed executive action on immigration could have made a difference in preventing Steinle's death.

END OF SUMMARY.
