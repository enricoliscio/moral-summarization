Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral angles.

The article starts with the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was shot on a pier in San Francisco. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, is an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a history of felonies, including drug offenses. The author is careful to point out that Lopez-Sanchez doesn't represent all undocumented immigrants, who are mostly law-abiding and contribute positively to society. The article mentions that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a low, and that increased immigration doesn't lead to more crime, citing research from the Immigration Policy Center. It also critiques Donald Trump's claims about immigrants being criminals, showing that such claims are unfounded.

The author argues against mass deportations, noting that Lopez-Sanchez had been deported multiple times but still managed to re-enter. The cost of deporting him five times was significant, and the focus on low-priority immigrants (like gardeners and maids) has distracted from targeting dangerous criminals. The recent change in deportation priorities by DHS to focus on serious criminals, recent arrivals, and terrorism threats is seen as a positive step. The article also mentions Obama's proposed executive action, which aimed to free resources to target criminals but was tied up legally. The author laments that the system failed Kate Steinle despite spending more on immigration enforcement than other law enforcement agencies combined. The conclusion is that undocumented immigrants shouldn't be vilified based on the actions of one individual.

Now, I need to summarize this, keeping the moral words like'shot,' 'arrested,' 'felony,' 'crime,''myth,''research,' 'wrong,' 'provide,''murder,' 'ignore,' 'deporting,' 'wasted,' 'enforcement,''slipped,''move,' 'threat,' 'efforts,' 'erred,''released,' 'failed,' 'tragedy,' 'vilified,' 'association.'

I should structure the summary to highlight the tragedy, the suspect's background, the argument against generalizing immigrants, the need for smarter enforcement, and the failure of the system. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft a few sentences, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral framing is maintained. I'll start with the tragedy, mention Lopez-Sanchez's background, then the author's argument against linking immigration to crime, the need for better enforcement, and the system's failure. I'll end by emphasizing not tovilify all immigrants based on one case.

I should check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Let me make sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral terms without being redundant.

SUMMARY: The article recounts the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with multiple felony convictions. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported five times, is accused of a violent crime, but the author argues he does not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are law-abiding and contribute positively to society. The article debunks the myth that increased immigration leads to more crime, citing research showing crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew. It criticizes the focus on deporting low-priority individuals, like gardeners and maids, while dangerous criminals slip through the system. The author highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals and recent arrivals, as recently proposed by DHS. Despite spending heavily on enforcement, the system failed to protect Steinle, emphasizing the need to avoid vilifying all undocumented immigrants based on one individual's actions. END OF SUMMARY.
