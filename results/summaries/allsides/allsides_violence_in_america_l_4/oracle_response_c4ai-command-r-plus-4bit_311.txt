SUMMARY: Kate Steinle, a 31-year-old woman, was fatally shot in San Francisco by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant living in the country without documentation and with a history of felony convictions. This tragic incident has sparked discussions about immigration and crime, with some using it as an example of the dangers of undocumented immigrants. However, the article argues that this is a myth and that most undocumented immigrants are productive members of society. It highlights research showing that crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population has grown and that mass shootings and other crimes are committed by individuals of various backgrounds, not just undocumented immigrants. The article also criticizes the current immigration enforcement system for wasting resources on deporting productive members of society while failing to target those who pose a real threat to public safety. It calls for smarter and better immigration enforcement that focuses on convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats. The tragic death of Kate Steinle should not be used to vilify all undocumented immigrants, who are often portrayed negatively in the media while their heroic actions are overlooked or ignored.
END OF SUMMARY.
