SUMMARY:
A senseless and tragic shooting occurred in San Francisco, resulting in the death of 31-year-old Kate Steinle. The alleged perpetrator, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant with a history of seven felony convictions, was arrested. However, it is essential to recognize that Lopez-Sanchez's actions do not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants, who are productive members of society. In fact, research shows that crime rates have fallen as the immigrant population has grown. The article highlights the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime and emphasizes that being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime. The tragic event underscores the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals and recent arrivals, rather than deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible.
