Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about Kate Steinle's death and the subsequent discussion on immigration policies. 

First, I'll identify the key points. The main event is Steinle's murder by an undocumented immigrant with a criminal history. The author argues that this shouldn't generalize all undocumented immigrants as criminals, pointing out that most are law-abiding. They also mention that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low and cite research showing lower crime rates with more immigrants. 

The article criticizes the current immigration enforcement, which often targets low-risk individuals instead of dangerous criminals. It highlights the need for smarter enforcement, focusing on serious criminals and recent arrivals. The author also mentions the failed executive action by Obama that could have helped target the right people but was blocked.

I need to make sure the summary doesn't just list facts but reflects the author's moral stance against stereotyping immigrants and the need for better enforcement strategies. I'll structure it to first state the incident, then the author's counterarguments, and conclude with the call for smarter policies.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically. Let me draft that now.

SUMMARY: A tragic incident in San Francisco, where undocumented immigrant Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez allegedly killed Kate Steinle, has sparked debates about immigration policy. Lopez-Sanchez, with a history of felony convictions, represents a dangerous individual, not the broader undocumented immigrant population. The author argues against generalizing undocumented immigrants as criminals, noting that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low and crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population grew. The article criticizes current enforcement strategies, which often target low-risk individuals rather than focusing on serious criminals. It advocates for smarter immigration enforcement, prioritizing felons and recent border crossers, rather than deporting productive community members. The author also highlights the failure of past policies, such as Lopez-Sanchez's repeated deportations and release, and the potential impact of Obama's blocked executive action, which could have redirected resources to target dangerous individuals. The tragedy underscores the need for a more effective, targeted approach to immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
