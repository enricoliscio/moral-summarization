SUMMARY: There was grim news from San Francisco as Kate Steinle, 31, was randomly shot and killed while walking with her father on a busy pier. A Mexican immigrant, who was in the country illegally, has been arrested for her death. This tragic incident has brought to light the issue of illegal immigration and crime in the United States. The accused, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had been deported five times and had seven felony convictions, including four for drug offenses. Despite this, some argue that he is not representative of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, nor is he proof that illegal immigration leads to more crime. Research shows that crime rates have actually fallen as the immigrant population has grown. The real issue is the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting those who are a genuine threat to public safety. The Department of Homeland Security has recently announced a re-evaluation of its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals. This shift in focus is a step in the right direction, as it will allow resources to be allocated towards capturing villains like Lopez-Sanchez, who are a danger to society. It is important to remember that being in the country illegally is a civil infraction and not a crime. Most undocumented immigrants are productive members of society, and it is unjust to vilify them all because of the actions of one dangerous individual. END OF SUMMARY.
