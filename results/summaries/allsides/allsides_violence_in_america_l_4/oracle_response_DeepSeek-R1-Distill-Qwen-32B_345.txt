Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral stance.

The article is about Kate Steinle's murder in San Francisco by Juan Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felonies. The author is critical of the narrative that undocumented immigrants are criminals, pointing out that Lopez-Sanchez is an exception. They mention that illegal immigration from Mexico is at a low, and that most immigrants are law-abiding. The author also discusses the inefficiency of current immigration enforcement, which targets productive workers instead of dangerous criminals. They argue for smarter enforcement and mention the Obama administration's proposed executive action, which was tied up legally. The article concludes that Steinle's death was a tragedy caused by one man, not all undocumented immigrants, and that the system failed by not focusing on real threats.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the morally framed words as possible. Let me list them: shot, arrested, death, reentering, deported, felony, crime, convictions, offenses, immigration, myth, research, wrong, provide, shootings, murder, overlook, ignore, rescued, deporting, wasted, take, enforcement, slipped, move, threat, focusing, efforts, threats, erred, released, freed, go, action, allowing, failed, tragedy, vilified, association.

I should structure the summary to highlight the moral points: the tragedy, the individual's actions don't represent all immigrants, the need for smarter enforcement, and the failure of the system. I need to include key terms like "tragedy," "murder," "felony," "illegal immigration," "myth," "research," "wasted," "enforcement," "slipped," "failed," and "vilified."

I'll start by stating the event, mention Lopez-Sanchez's background, then the author's argument against the myth, cite research, discuss enforcement issues, and conclude with the tragedy and the need for better policies.

Let me check if I'm including all the necessary terms without making the summary too long. I should aim for around 200 words. I need to ensure the summary flows logically and maintains the moral framing, avoiding any neutral language where possible.

Wait, I should also mention that Lopez-Sanchez had been deported multiple times and that the system failed to keep him out. The article also points out that deporting productive workers is a waste of resources. The proposed executive action aimed to focus on real threats but was blocked.

I think I've covered all the key points and included the morally framed words. Let me draft the summary now, making sure it's concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY:  
The article recounts the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed by Juan Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felonies, including drug offenses. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported multiple times, is accused of a violent crime, but the author argues he does not represent the millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., most of whom are law-abiding. The article debunks the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, citing research showing crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew. It criticizes the current immigration enforcement system, which often targets productive workers while allowing dangerous individuals like Lopez-Sanchez to remain free. The author highlights the need for smarter enforcement, focusing on serious criminals and recent border crossers, rather than wasting resources on deporting law-abiding immigrants. The tragedy of Steinle's death is attributed to the failure of the system, not all undocumented immigrants, urging a shift in priorities to protect public safety without vilifying an entire group. END OF SUMMARY.
