SUMMARY:
There was grim news from San Francisco as Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally and randomly shot while walking with her father on a busy pier. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico with a history of felony convictions, including a horrific crime. Despite this, it is wrong to paint all undocumented immigrants as criminals or to associate them with increased crime rates. Research shows that crime rates fell as the immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, grew from 1990 to 2010. Most undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families. Lopez-Sanchez is an example of a dangerous individual who slipped through the cracks of our immigration enforcement system. He had been deported five times and was still in the country, highlighting the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security's recent decision to refocus deportation priorities on recent arrivals and serious criminals is a step in the right direction. The focus should be on targeting those who are a real threat to public safety, such as convicted criminals and terrorism threats. The failure to keep Lopez-Sanchez behind bars or seek a warrant for his arrest demonstrates the flaws in our current system. President Obama's proposed executive action on immigration, currently tied up in a legal battle, could have also made a difference by freeing up resources to go after criminals. Unfortunately, despite our country's significant spending on immigration enforcement, our system failed Kate Steinle. We must not vilify all undocumented immigrants by false association with this tragic and horrific incident.
