SUMMARY:
The fatal shooting of Kate Steinle, 31, by a Mexican immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who was in the country without documentation, has sparked a national debate. However, Lopez-Sanchez's horrific crime should not be used to vilify the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. Research shows that crime rates have actually fallen as the immigrant population has grown. Lopez-Sanchez is a dangerous individual who should not have been free, but his case is not representative of the overwhelming majority of immigrants who are productive members of society. The government's focus on deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is misguided and a waste of taxpayer money. Instead, the country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement, targeting serious criminals like Lopez-Sanchez. The Department of Homeland Security's new deportation priorities are a step in the right direction. END OF SUMMARY.
