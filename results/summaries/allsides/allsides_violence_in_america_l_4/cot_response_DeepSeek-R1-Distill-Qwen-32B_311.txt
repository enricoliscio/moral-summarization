Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Kate Steinle's death and the subsequent discussion on immigration policies. They also specified two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and second, writing a concise summary using those words.

Starting with step one, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "grim," "innocent," "horrific," "violent," "felony," "myth," "criminals," "vilified," etc., stand out because they express judgment or evaluation. I'll list each of these words with a star before them.

For step two, the summary needs to be under 200 words and include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The key points are the tragic event, Lopez-Sanchez's background, the argument against linking immigration with crime, the need for smarter enforcement, and the failure of current policies. I'll structure the summary to highlight these points while using the identified moral terms to maintain the original framing.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the tragedy, moving to the broader implications, and ending with the call for better enforcement strategies. Also, I need to avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and concise.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it captures all the essential elements and retains the moral perspective. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present both the identified words and the summary as per the user's instructions.

**SUMMARY:**  
The tragic death of Kate Steinle, killed by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a undocumented immigrant with a violent criminal history, sparked debates about immigration and crime. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported multiple times, is not representative of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., most of whom are productive and law-abiding. Research shows that crime rates decreased as the immigrant population grew, debunking the myth that undocumented immigrants are inherently criminal. The article emphasizes the need for smarter immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals rather than wasting resources on low-priority cases. Lopez-Sanchez's case highlights the failure of current enforcement strategies, as he was allowed to remain free despite his dangerous history. The government's recent shift to prioritize deporting recent arrivals and felons is a step in the right direction. Kate Steinle's death was a tragedy, but it should not be used tovilify all undocumented immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
