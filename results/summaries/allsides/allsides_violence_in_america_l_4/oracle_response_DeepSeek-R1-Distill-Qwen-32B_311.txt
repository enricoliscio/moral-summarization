Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I should focus on those words to maintain the author's perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Kate Steinle's murder, the suspect's background, and the author's argument against linking undocumented immigrants to crime.

I need to include key terms like "shot," "arrested," "felony," "crime," "deportation," "myth," and "research." Also, the author mentions the need for smarter immigration enforcement, so words like "enforcement," "wasted," and "slipped" are important.

I should structure the summary to highlight the tragedy, the suspect's history, the myth about immigration and crime, and the call for better enforcement strategies. I'll make sure to mention the wasted resources and the focus on serious criminals.

Let me start drafting, ensuring I don't exceed 200 words and include as many of the listed words as possible without losing the moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
The article discusses the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a history of felony convictions, including drug offenses. Lopez-Sanchez, who had been deported multiple times, is accused of a violent crime, but the author emphasizes that he does not represent the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., most of whom are law-abiding and contribute positively to society. The article challenges the myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime, citing research showing crime rates fell as the immigrant population grew. It also critiques the portrayal of undocumented immigrants as criminals, noting that many are productive workers seeking a better life. The author argues that deporting all undocumented immigrants is not the solution, as Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks despite multiple deportations. The article highlights the need for smarter immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals rather than wasting resources on productive community members. It also points out that President Obama's proposed executive action, which prioritized targeting criminals, could have prevented such tragedies. The author concludes that undocumented immigrants should not be vilified for the actions of one dangerous individual.  
END OF SUMMARY.
