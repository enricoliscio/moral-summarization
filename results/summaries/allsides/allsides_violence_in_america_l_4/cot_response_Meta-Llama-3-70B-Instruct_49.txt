SUMMARY:
A senseless and horrific crime occurred in San Francisco when Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant who was in the country without documentation and had seven other felony convictions. However, it is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. In fact, research shows that crime rates fell in the US as the immigrant population grew. Lopez-Sanchez is a dangerous individual who should not have been free, but he does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants who are productive members of society. The government's current approach to immigration enforcement is flawed, wasting resources on deporting non-criminals while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slip through the cracks. A more targeted approach, focusing on serious criminals and recent arrivals, is needed to prevent such tragedies. END OF SUMMARY.
