SUMMARY: There has been a recent tragic incident in San Francisco where Kate Steinle, 31, was killed, apparently *randomly*. The suspect is an undocumented Mexican immigrant with a criminal record who was in the country *illegally*. This has sparked a moral debate about the association between undocumented immigrants and *crime*. The article argues that it is a *myth* that *undocumented* immigrants are more likely to commit *crimes*, citing research showing that *crime rates fell* as the immigrant population grew. It also highlights the fact that *being* undocumented is a civil *infraction*, not a *crime*. The article calls for *smarter and better immigration enforcement*, focusing on *serious* threats to *public safety* rather than *wasting* resources on productive members of communities. It criticizes the current system for *wasting* time, *manpower*, and money on chasing non-threatening undocumented immigrants while *dangerous felons* like Lopez-Sanchez *slip through the cracks*. The article also discusses how the suspect should not have been in the country and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement *erred* in not seeking a *court order* for his arrest. It mentions President Obama's proposed *executive action* on immigration, which is currently tied up in a legal battle and could have potentially freed resources to focus on *criminals*. Despite our country's high spending on immigration *enforcement*, the system ultimately *failed* Kate Steinle. The article concludes by emphasizing that not all undocumented immigrants should be *vilified* due to a false association with *crime*.
