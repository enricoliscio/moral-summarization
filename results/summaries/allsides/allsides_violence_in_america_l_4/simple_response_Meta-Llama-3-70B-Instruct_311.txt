SUMMARY:

The recent fatal shooting of Kate Steinle in San Francisco by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant with a criminal record, has sparked controversy over illegal immigration. However, the author argues that Lopez-Sanchez's actions do not represent the majority of undocumented immigrants, who are productive members of society. Research shows that crime rates have decreased as the immigrant population has grown. The author also notes that being in the country without authorization is a civil infraction, not a crime. The incident highlights the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement, focusing on serious criminals and recent arrivals, rather than deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible. The Department of Homeland Security's recent announcement to rethink deportation priorities is a step in the right direction. The author concludes that vilifying all undocumented immigrants based on one individual's actions is unfair and misguided.

END OF SUMMARY.
