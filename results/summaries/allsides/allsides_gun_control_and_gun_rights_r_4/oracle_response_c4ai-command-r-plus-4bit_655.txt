SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the US has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, marking a significant shift in public opinion since the tragic Newtown school shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead in 2012. The poll found that 52% of Americans prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, an increase of 7% since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. This shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among Black Americans, who increasingly view guns as a tool for public safety and crime prevention. The research also revealed a stark partisan divide, with Democrats generally favoring gun control measures while Republicans and independents strongly support gun rights. Despite this overall trend, support for specific gun control measures, such as universal background checks, remains strong, highlighting the complex and nuanced nature of the gun debate in the wake of devastating shootings and incidents of gun violence.

END OF SUMMARY.
