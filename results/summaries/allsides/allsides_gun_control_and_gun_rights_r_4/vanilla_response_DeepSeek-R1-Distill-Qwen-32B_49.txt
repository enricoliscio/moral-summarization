Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the shift in American support for gun rights. The article mentions that according to Pew Research, support for the Second Amendment is at its highest in two decades, up 7% since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. I should note that this increase is significant and part of it is due to changing attitudes among black Americans, who now see guns as protective rather than a risk. 

The article also talks about the political response post-Newtown, where Obama pushed for stricter gun laws, but those efforts were blocked by gun rights supporters. I should include that while some states acted, federal measures stalled. There's mention of specific polling support for background checks being high, but other measures like limiting rifles have less support.

I should also highlight the partisan divide, as gun control advocates argue that the survey's wording might influence results. The summary needs to mention the overall shift across demographics, except for Hispanics, and the current support levels among different groups.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: the increase in support, the role of black Americans, the political actions post-Newtown, the specific poll results, the criticism of survey wording, and the demographic shifts. I'll structure it to flow logically from the main finding, through the causes and implications, ending with the current support levels.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, support for Second Amendment rights has increased by 7 percentage points, with 52% of Americans prioritizing gun rights over gun control. This shift is partly driven by changing attitudes among black Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective, up from 29% two years ago. The survey reflects a sharp partisan divide, with 53% of Republicans and 50% of independents favoring gun rights, while Democrats remain divided. Gun control supporters argue that the survey's wording may influence results, as the phrasing emphasizes "rights" over "control." Despite this, support for specific measures like universal background checks remains strong at 90%, while support for stricter rifle and magazine limits hovers around 50%. The shift in attitudes has occurred across most demographics, with African American and white support for gun rights rising, while Hispanic support slightly declined. END OF SUMMARY.
