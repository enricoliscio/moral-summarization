SUMMARY:
A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in Americans' attitudes towards gun rights, with 52% now prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, a 7-point increase since the 2012 Newtown school shooting. This marks the highest approval rating in two decades. Notably, black Americans' views have dramatically changed, with 54% now believing firearms protect people from being victims of crimes, up from 29% two years ago. While Democrats remain committed to imposing new restrictions, gun rights supporters have successfully blocked efforts in the Senate. The survey's findings reflect a sharp partisan divide, with majorities of Republicans and independents prioritizing the Second Amendment over gun control. Despite this, support for specific changes, such as universal background checks, remains high. END OF SUMMARY.
