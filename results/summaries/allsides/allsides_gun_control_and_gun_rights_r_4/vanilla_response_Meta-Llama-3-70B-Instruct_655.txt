SUMMARY:

According to a Pew Research Center survey, support for gun rights has increased significantly over the past two years, with 52% of Americans believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a 7-point increase from 2012, following the Newtown school shooting. The shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, who are increasingly likely to view guns as good for public safety. The survey also found that support for gun control peaked in the late 1990s and has dropped 20 percentage points since then. The shift in support for gun rights is seen across nearly all demographic lines, including men and women, old and young, white and black, and Republican and Democrat. Despite this, Democrats and gun control supporters remain committed to imposing new restrictions.
