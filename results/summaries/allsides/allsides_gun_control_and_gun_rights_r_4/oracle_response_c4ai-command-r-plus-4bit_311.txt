SUMMARY: Gun rights are more popular than ever, according to new data from the Pew Research Center, just two years after the tragic Newtown school shooting that left 20 children and six faculty dead. The study found that a majority of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, marking a significant shift in public opinion. This shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, who increasingly see guns as a tool for public safety and crime prevention. The findings highlight a stark partisan divide on the issue, with Democrats generally favoring gun control measures while Republicans and independents prioritize gun rights. Despite calls for stricter gun control laws following horrific incidents like the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza shot and killed his victims before turning the gun on himself, efforts to enact new restrictions have stalled in Congress. Gun rights supporters have successfully blocked proposed legislation, and the issue remains highly divisive. While some gun control supporters point to other polls showing strong support for specific reforms, such as universal background checks, the overall trend suggests a growing acceptance of gun rights in America. This shift in public opinion underscores the challenge faced by those advocating for stricter gun control measures.
