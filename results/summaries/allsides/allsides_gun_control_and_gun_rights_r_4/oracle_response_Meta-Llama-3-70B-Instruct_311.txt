SUMMARY:

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in American attitudes towards gun rights, with 52% of respondents believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a 7-point increase since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which left 20 schoolchildren and six faculty dead. The survey also shows a dramatic change in attitudes among black Americans, with 54% now believing that firearms protect people from being victims of crimes, up from 29% two years ago. Despite the Newtown tragedy, which saw 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza kill his mother, drive to the school, and fatally shoot 26 people before committing suicide, gun rights supporters have rallied, blocking efforts to impose new restrictions. While Democrats remain committed to enacting new gun control laws, the survey suggests a growing divide on the issue, with many Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over concerns about gun violence.
