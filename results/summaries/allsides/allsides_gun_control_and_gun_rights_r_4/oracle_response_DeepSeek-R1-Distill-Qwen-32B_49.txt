Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should focus on the morally framed words provided, which are: shooting, dead, crimes, killed, drove, shot, suicide, violence. 

First, I should read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how support for gun rights in the US has increased significantly since the Newtown shooting. The Pew Research Center found that 52% of Americans prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up from 45% after Sandy Hook. The article mentions a shift among black Americans, where 54% now see guns as protective, up from 29% two years ago. The author also notes the impact of the Newtown shooting, where 26 people were killed, and President Obama's failed efforts to pass stricter laws. There's a mention of a partisan divide and how specific wording in surveys can influence results.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the moral words. I should use terms like "shooting," "dead," "crimes," "killed," "shot," "suicide," and "violence" where appropriate. I'll start by stating the increase in support for gun rights, referencing the Newtown shooting and the number of dead. Then, mention the shift in attitudes among black Americans regarding public safety. I'll include the statistics about the increase in support from 29% to 54%. 

I should also touch on the Sandy Hook incident, using "killed" and "shot." Then, mention President Obama's call for restrictions and the subsequent blockage by gun rights supporters. I'll note the specific support for universal background checks and the partisan divide, using the word "violence" if it fits naturally. I'll also include the demographic shifts, making sure to highlight the increase across different groups but note the slight drop among Hispanics. Finally, I'll mention the overall trend and the focus on rights over control.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the main finding, then the Newtown context, the demographic shifts, the political response, and the survey's implications. I'll ensure that each sentence includes the moral terms where relevant without forcing them in. 

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the specified moral words. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights has surged to its highest level in two decades, according to Pew Research, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun controlâ€”a 7% increase since the Newtown shooting in 2012, where 20 children and six faculty were killed. This shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective against crime, up from 29% two years ago. The Newtown tragedy, where gunman Adam Lanza killed his mother, 26 others, and then committed suicide, initially sparked calls for stricter gun laws, but efforts were blocked in Congress. Gun control supporters point to strong backing for universal background checks (90% support), though support for limiting rifles and magazines remains around 50%. The survey highlights a partisan divide, with Republicans and independents favoring gun rights, while Democrats lean toward control. Overall, support for gun rights has increased across most demographics, reflecting a broader cultural shift toward prioritizing rights over violence prevention. END OF SUMMARY.
