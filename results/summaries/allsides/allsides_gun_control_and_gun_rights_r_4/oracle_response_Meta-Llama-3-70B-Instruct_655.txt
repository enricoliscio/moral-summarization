SUMMARY:

Support for gun rights has surged to a two-decade high, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, according to a Pew Research Center study. This marks a stunning turnaround since the 2012 Newtown school shooting, which left 20 schoolchildren and six faculty dead. The shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, who increasingly view guns as a public safety boon, with 54% saying firearms protect people from being victims of crimes. Just two years ago, only 29% of blacks held this view. The findings come despite President Obama's calls for stricter gun control measures following the shooting, which saw 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza kill his mother, then drive to the elementary school where he fatally shot 26 people before turning the gun on himself to commit suicide. Gun control supporters argue that other polling still shows strong support for specific changes, such as universal background checks, but the Pew study suggests a growing partisan divide on the issue.
