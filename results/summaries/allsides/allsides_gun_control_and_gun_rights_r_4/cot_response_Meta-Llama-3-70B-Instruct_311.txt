SUMMARY:
According to the latest data from the Pew Research Center, support for gun rights has surged to its highest level in two decades, with 52% of Americans believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a stunning turnaround since the Newtown school shooting in 2012. Notably, black Americans are increasingly likely to view guns as a public safety boon, with 54% saying firearms protect people from being victims of crimes. The shift in opinion is attributed to a sharp partisan divide, with Democrats remaining committed to imposing new restrictions. Despite this, support for specific changes, such as universal background checks, remains high. The survey's findings suggest that Americans are more likely to prioritize the right to own guns over the need to control gun ownership. END OF SUMMARY.
