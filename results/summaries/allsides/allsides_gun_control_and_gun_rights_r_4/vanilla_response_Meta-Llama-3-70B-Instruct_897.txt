SUMMARY:

According to a Pew Research Center survey, support for gun rights has increased significantly over the past two years, with 52% of Americans believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a 7-point increase since the Newtown school shooting in 2012. The shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, who are increasingly likely to view guns as a means of public safety. The survey found that 54% of blacks believe firearms protect people from being victims of crimes, up from 29% two years ago. Despite this trend, Democrats remain committed to imposing new gun control restrictions, citing strong support for specific changes such as universal background checks. The survey highlights a sharp partisan divide on the issue, with majorities of Republicans and independents supporting gun rights.
