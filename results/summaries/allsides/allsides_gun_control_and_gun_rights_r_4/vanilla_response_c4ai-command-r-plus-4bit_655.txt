SUMMARY: According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, support for gun rights in the United States is at its highest level in two decades, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This shift in attitude is particularly notable among black Americans, who increasingly view guns as beneficial for public safety. The survey also reveals a shift across demographic lines, with men, women, young and old, white, black, Republican, and Democrat all showing increased support for gun rights. The findings represent a significant turnaround from the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which sparked calls for stricter gun control measures. Despite this, gun control supporters point to other polls indicating strong support for specific reforms, such as universal background checks. The shift in public opinion is attributed to factors such as a partisan divide and changing attitudes towards firearms, with a majority of Americans now viewing guns as a means of protection rather than a risk to public safety.
