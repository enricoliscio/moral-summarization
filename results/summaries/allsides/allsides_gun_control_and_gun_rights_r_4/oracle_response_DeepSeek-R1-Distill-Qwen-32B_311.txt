Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that the author used specific morally charged words like "shooting," "dead," "crimes," etc. So, I should make sure to include those in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a Pew Research Center survey showing increased support for gun rights in the US, especially among black Americans, two years after the Newtown shooting. The article mentions that 52% of Americans prioritize gun rights over control now, up from 45% after Sandy Hook. It also notes a shift in black Americans' views, with 54% seeing guns as protective now versus 41% as a risk, up from 29% who saw them as protective before.

I need to include the morally framed words. The article uses terms like "shooting," "dead," "crimes," "killed," "drove," "shot," "suicide," and "violence." I should make sure these are present in the summary.

I'll start by stating the increase in gun rights support, referencing the Newtown shooting and the moral implications. Then, mention the shift in black Americans' attitudes, using "crimes" and "protective." I'll include the statistics and the fact that this change is part of a broader trend across demographics, noting the specific wording of the survey and its impact.

I should also touch on the political response, like Obama's call for restrictions and the subsequent blockage by gun rights supporters. Mentioning the commemoration event and Pelosi's statement adds the moral angle of urgency.

Finally, I'll note the support for specific policies like background checks and the partisan divide, using "violence" and "legislation" to maintain the moral framing.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the necessary moral terms. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the overall trend, then the demographic shifts, political reactions, and concluding with the implications of the survey's wording and the ongoing debate.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights has surged to its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey, reflecting a dramatic shift in public opinion since the Newtown shooting. A majority (52%) of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up 7 percentage points since 2012. This shift is particularly pronounced among black Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective against crime, compared to 29% two years ago. The survey highlights a broader trend across demographics, with support for gun rights rising among men, women, whites, and independents, though Hispanics saw a slight decline. Gun control advocates argue that the survey's wording may have influenced results, as it framed the issue as a choice between "control gun ownership" and "protect the right to own guns." The findings come amid ongoing debates over gun violence and legislative efforts to curb it, with Democrats emphasizing the need for action to prevent future shootings and crimes. END OF SUMMARY.
