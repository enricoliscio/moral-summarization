SUMMARY:

A stunning turnaround in American attitudes towards gun rights has been revealed by the Pew Research Center, with 52% of Americans now believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a 7% increase since the devastating Newtown school shooting in 2012, which left 20 schoolchildren and six faculty dead. The shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, who are increasingly likely to view guns as a means of protecting people from being victims of crimes. In fact, 54% of blacks now believe firearms protect people from crimes, compared to 41% who see them as a public safety risk. The findings are all the more striking given the direction the debate appeared to be heading two years ago, when President Obama called for major new restrictions on gun rights in the wake of the shooting. However, gun rights supporters rallied, blocking those efforts and leaving the matter stalled. Despite this, Democrats remain committed to imposing new restrictions to curb gun violence.
