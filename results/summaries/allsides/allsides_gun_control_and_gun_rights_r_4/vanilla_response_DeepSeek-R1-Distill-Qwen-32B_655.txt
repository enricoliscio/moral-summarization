Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the shift in American support for gun rights. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article mentions that according to the Pew Research Center, support for gun rights is at its highest in two decades. This is interesting because it's a turnaround from just two years after the Newtown shooting. Back then, 52% of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up from 45% after Sandy Hook. That's a significant jump.

The article also notes that this change is partly due to shifting attitudes among black Americans. Previously, only 29% saw guns as a public safety benefit, but now 54% do, while 41% see them as a risk. That's a big shift in a short time.

I should mention the Newtown shooting as a key event. It involved a gunman killing 20 children and six faculty, which led President Obama to push for stricter gun laws, including background checks and bans on certain firearms. However, these efforts were blocked by gun rights supporters in the Senate.

Despite the federal stalemate, some states took action, and Democrats remain committed to new restrictions. The article also points out that while 90% support universal background checks, support for limiting rifles and magazines is just over 50%.

There's a mention of a partisan divide, with Democrats mostly backing gun control and Republicans and independents favoring gun rights. The wording of the survey might have influenced the results, as the question framed it as a choice between controlling ownership or protecting rights.

Additionally, the support for gun control peaked in the late 90s at 66% but has since dropped by 20 points. The recent shift is across all demographics except Hispanics, whose support slightly decreased.

I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: the increase in gun rights support, the role of black Americans, the Newtown shooting's impact, the federal response and its failure, the demographic shifts, and the potential survey wording influence.

I should structure it to start with the main finding, then explain the factors, the historical context, and the implications. Make sure to include the percentages and the demographic breakdowns briefly.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring I cover all critical aspects without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Fifty-two percent of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up from 45% after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. This shift is partly due to changing attitudes among black Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective, up from 29% two years ago. The Newtown shooting, where 26 were killed, led President Obama to push for stricter gun laws, but these efforts were blocked in the Senate. While 90% support universal background checks, support for limiting rifles and magazines is just over 50%. The survey highlights a partisan divide, with Democrats favoring gun control and Republicans and independents backing gun rights. The shift spans most demographics, except Hispanics, whose support slightly decreased. Gun control support peaked at 66% in the late 1990s but has since dropped by 20 points. END OF SUMMARY.
