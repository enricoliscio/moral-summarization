SUMMARY: Gun rights are now more supported by Americans than they have been in decades, according to recent data from the Pew Research Center. This shift in public opinion is surprising given the tragic Newtown school shooting just two years ago, where a gunman killed his mother and then drove to an elementary school to fatally shoot 20 children and six staff members before taking his own life. The shooting sparked calls for stricter gun control measures by President Obama and other Democrats, but these efforts were blocked by gun rights supporters. While there is still strong support for universal background checks and some restrictions on rifles and ammunition, the Pew survey found that 52% of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control. This shift is seen across demographics, with increasing support for gun rights among men, women, young and old, whites, blacks, Republicans, and independents. The changing attitudes among black Americans are particularly notable, with more believing that firearms protect people from crimes. The debate between gun rights and gun control remains highly polarized, but the recent data suggests a significant turnaround in public opinion since the Sandy Hook tragedy. END OF SUMMARY.
