SUMMARY:

According to a Pew Research Center survey, support for gun rights has increased significantly over the past two years, with 52% of Americans now believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a 7-point increase since the Newtown school shooting in 2012. Notably, black Americans have shifted their views dramatically, with 54% now seeing firearms as a means of public safety, up from 29% two years ago. Despite this trend, gun control supporters remain committed to imposing new restrictions, citing strong support for specific changes, such as universal background checks. The survey also highlights a partisan divide on the issue, with Republicans and independents more likely to prioritize gun rights over gun control. Overall, the survey suggests a shift in public opinion on gun rights, with support for gun control peaking in the late 1990s and dropping 20 percentage points since then.
