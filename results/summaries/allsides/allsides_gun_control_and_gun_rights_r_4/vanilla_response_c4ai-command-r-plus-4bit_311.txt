SUMMARY: A recent Pew Research Center survey finds that support for gun rights in the US is at its highest level in two decades, with 52% of Americans prioritizing the Second Amendment over gun control. This shift in public opinion is notable given the increased focus on gun control following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among Black Americans, with more believing that guns are good for public safety. The survey also reveals a widening partisan divide on the issue, with Republicans and independents favoring gun rights, while Democrats generally support gun control. While support for gun rights has increased across most demographic groups, there has been a slight decrease among Hispanics. Gun control supporters argue that other polls show strong support for specific measures such as universal background checks, and that the Pew survey's wording may have influenced the results by framing the issue as a choice between "controlling gun ownership" and "protecting the right to own guns." Despite these arguments, the Pew survey suggests a notable shift in public opinion toward prioritizing gun rights over gun control. END OF SUMMARY.
