SUMMARY:
A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in Americans' attitudes towards gun ownership, with 52% prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, a 7-point increase from 2012. This change is driven in part by a dramatic shift among black Americans, who now view guns as a public safety boon, with 54% believing firearms protect people from being victims of crimes. In contrast, only 29% held this view two years ago. Despite President Obama's call for major new restrictions on gun rights after the Newtown school shooting, gun rights supporters rallied, blocking efforts in the Senate. While Democrats remain committed to imposing new restrictions, Pew's findings reflect a sharp partisan divide on the issue. The survey's wording may have influenced the results, but the shift over time is clear, with support for gun control dropping 20 percentage points since the late 1990s. END OF SUMMARY.
