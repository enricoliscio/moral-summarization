Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

The article discusses a shift in American public opinion towards gun rights, with support increasing significantly since the Newtown shooting. Pew Research Center found that 52% now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up from 45% two years ago. This change is notable among black Americans, with a dramatic increase in viewing guns as beneficial for public safety. 

I should note that this shift is a turnaround from the expected direction post-Newtown. Gun control efforts were blocked in the Senate, and while some states acted, federal action stalled. The article also mentions that support for specific measures like background checks remains high, but there's a partisan divide. 

I need to highlight the key points: the increase in gun rights support, the demographic shifts, the impact of Newtown, and the implications of the survey's wording. I should also mention the ongoing debate and the importance of specific policies.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral aspects, such as the right to own guns versus the risk of gun violence. I'll structure it by first stating the main finding, then the demographic changes, the context of Newtown, the political response, and the implications of the survey's wording. Finally, I'll mention the ongoing debate and the support for specific policies.

Let me make sure to include the statistics accurately and present the information clearly without bias, just as the original article does. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language straightforward.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to Pew Research Center, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, up from 45% two years after the Newtown school shooting. This shift is particularly notable among black Americans, with 54% now viewing guns as beneficial for public safety, compared to 29% two years ago. The change comes despite efforts by President Obama and Democrats to push for stricter gun control measures, which were blocked in the Senate. Gun control supporters highlight strong backing for universal background checks (90%), while support for limiting rifles and magazines remains around 50%. The survey's wording may have influenced results, as the phrasing "control gun ownership" versus "protect the right to own guns" could skew responses. Over time, support for gun control peaked at 66% in the late 1990s but has since dropped by 20 percentage points. The recent shift spans nearly all demographics, with blacks and whites increasing their support for gun rights, while Hispanics saw a slight decline. Democrats remain divided, with only 28% backing gun rights, though majorities of Republicans and independents favor Second Amendment rights. END OF SUMMARY.
