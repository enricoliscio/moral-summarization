SUMMARY:

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in American attitudes towards gun rights, with 52% of respondents prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, a 7-point increase from 2012. This marks the highest approval rating in two decades. Notably, black Americans have dramatically changed their views, with 54% now believing firearms protect people from crime, up from 29% two years ago. Despite the Newtown school shooting in 2012, which sparked calls for stricter gun laws, gun rights supporters have successfully blocked federal efforts to impose new restrictions. While some polls still show strong support for specific changes, such as universal background checks, the partisan divide on the issue remains sharp. The survey's wording may have influenced the results, but the shift in public opinion is undeniable, with support for gun control dropping 20 percentage points since the late 1990s.

END OF SUMMARY.
