Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about gun rights support in the US. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that support for gun rights is at its highest in decades according to Pew Research. It notes that this is a significant change from two years after the Newtown shooting in 2012. The percentage of Americans valuing Second Amendment rights over gun control has increased by 7 points to 52%. That's the highest in 20 years.

The article also points out that this shift is partly due to changing attitudes among black Americans. Previously, only 29% of blacks saw guns as beneficial for public safety, but now 54% do, while 41% see them as a risk. The article mentions the Sandy Hook shooting and President Obama's push for gun control, which didn't pass in the Senate. Gun control supporters still have strong backing for universal background checks, but support for limiting rifles and magazines is just over 50%.

There's a mention of a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence who thinks the survey's wording influenced the results, as "control gun ownership" might not be as appealing as "protect rights." The article also notes that support for gun control peaked in the late '90s and has dropped since, with the recent shift happening across most demographics. African-Americans and whites increased their support, while Hispanics saw a slight drop. Democrats still favor gun control, but majorities of Republicans and independents prioritize the Second Amendment.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: the increase in gun rights support, the role of black Americans, the impact of Sandy Hook, the legislative response, and the demographic shifts.

I should start by stating the main finding from Pew. Then explain the shift among black Americans. Mention the Sandy Hook event and Obama's failed gun control push. Highlight the specific support for background checks versus other measures. Note the criticism about survey wording. Then discuss the overall trend from the '90s and the demographic breakdown, ending with the political divide.

I need to make sure the summary is concise and covers all these aspects without getting too detailed. Also, keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Fifty-two percent of Americans prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up 7 percentage points since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. This shift is driven by changing attitudes among black Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as beneficial for public safety, compared to 29% two years ago. Despite President Obama's push for stricter gun laws after Sandy Hook, which included universal background checks and bans on high-capacity weapons, efforts stalled in Congress. Gun control supporters note strong backing for background checks (90% support) but only modest support for limiting rifles and magazines (just over 50%). Critics argue the survey's wording may have skewed results, as "protecting rights" is more appealing than "controlling ownership." Pew's findings also show a 20-point decline in gun control support since the late 1990s, with increases across most demographics, including African-Americans (24% to 34%) and whites (53% to 61%). Hispanics saw a slight drop (25%). While Democrats favor gun control, majorities of Republicans and independents prioritize Second Amendment rights. END OF SUMMARY.
