Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the shift in American support for gun rights. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article mentions that according to Pew Research, support for gun rights is at its highest in two decades, up from 45% to 52% since the Newtown shooting in 2012. That's a significant increase. It also notes that this change is partly due to African-Americans increasingly viewing guns as beneficial for public safety—54% now see firearms as protective, up from 29% two years ago.

The article contrasts this with the previous direction after the Newtown shooting, where President Obama pushed for stricter gun laws, but those efforts were blocked. Now, even though some states have acted, federal measures are still stalled.

It also talks about specific polling data: universal background checks are supported by 90% of Americans, while support for limiting rifles and magazines is just over 50%. The article mentions a spokesman for a gun control group pointing out that the survey's wording might influence results, as people might prefer the idea of rights over control.

Additionally, the article shows that support for gun rights has increased across most demographics, except for a slight drop among Hispanics. Democrats still mostly support gun control, but majorities of Republicans and independents prioritize gun rights.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main increase in support for gun rights, mention the factors like African-Americans' changing views, the stalled federal efforts, specific polling numbers, the survey's wording critique, and the demographic shifts.

Let me make sure to include all key points without going over the word limit. I'll structure it to first present the overall trend, then delve into specifics and implications.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control—a 7% increase since the 2012 Newtown shooting. This shift is driven in part by African-Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective, up from 29% two years ago. Despite President Obama's push for stricter gun laws post-Newtown, federal efforts stalled, though some states acted. Polling shows strong support for universal background checks (90%), while limits on rifles and magazines have 50% support. Critics argue the survey's wording may skew results, favoring "rights" over "control." Gun rights support has increased across most demographics, including a rise from 24% to 34% among African-Americans and 53% to 61% among whites. Hispanics saw a slight drop (25%). While Democrats favor gun control, majorities of Republicans and independents prioritize gun rights. END OF SUMMARY.
