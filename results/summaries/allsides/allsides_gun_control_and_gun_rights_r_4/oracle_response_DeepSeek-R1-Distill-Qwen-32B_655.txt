Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about how support for gun rights in the US has increased significantly over the past two years, especially after the Newtown shooting. The author used words like "shooting," "dead," "crimes," "killed," "drove," "shot," "suicide," and "violence" to highlight the moral aspects of the issue.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It mentions that according to Pew Research, 52% of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up from 45% after Sandy Hook. This shift is notable, especially among black Americans, where support jumped from 29% to 54%. The article also notes that gun control efforts stalled in Congress, with some states acting instead. There's a mention of the moral framing through the use of violent terms, so I need to include those in the summary.

I should structure the summary to include the key statistics, the demographic shifts, and the political context. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to convey the gravity of the issue. I'll also keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and end it properly with the tokens.

I think the summary should start by stating the increase in gun rights support, mention the Newtown shooting, the demographic changes, the political response, and the moral framing. I'll ensure that each of the author's moral words is included where appropriate without making the summary too long.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all the necessary points and the moral terms. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review it to ensure it accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the intended moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has surged to its highest level in two decades, according to Pew Research, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This shift follows the 2012 Newtown school shooting, where gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six faculty before committing suicide. Black Americans' support for gun rights has dramatically increased, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective against crime, up from 29% two years ago. Gun control efforts stalled in Congress after the shooting, with President Obama advocating for stricter laws, but Republican and independent majorities favor gun rights. Specific polling shows strong support for universal background checks, though limits on rifles and magazines remain divisive. The survey's wording, emphasizing "rights" over "control," may have influenced results. Support for gun rights has risen across demographics, except among Hispanics, whose support dropped slightly. Democrats still favor gun control, but the overall trend reflects a sharp partisan divide and a moral shift in how Americans view gun ownership and public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
