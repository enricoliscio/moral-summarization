SUMMARY: Americans' support for gun rights is at its highest in two decades, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, revealing a disturbing shift in moral priorities since the tragic Newtown school shooting. In a shocking turnaround, 52% of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, a 7% increase since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that took the lives of 20 children and six faculty members. This shift is driven by changing attitudes among black Americans, who increasingly view guns as a tool for public safety rather than a risk. The research suggests a worrying trend, with support for gun control dropping 20 points since the 1990s, and a shift across all demographics towards prioritizing gun rights over sensible legislation to prevent gun violence. Even in the face of devastating mass shootings like Newtown, Americans are becoming more resistant to calls for gun control, with gun rights supporters blocking President Obama's efforts to enact meaningful restrictions. While specific wording in surveys can influence results, the overall trend indicates a dangerous moral compromise, with Americans valuing gun ownership over the right to be free from gun violence. This shift in moral framing underscores the challenge faced by those seeking to enact common-sense gun control measures to protect our communities.
