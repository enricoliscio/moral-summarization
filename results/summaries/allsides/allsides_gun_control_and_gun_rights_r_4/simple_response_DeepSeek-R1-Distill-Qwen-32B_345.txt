Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about a Pew Research Center survey showing increased support for gun rights in the U.S., especially among black Americans. The shift happened two years after the Newtown shooting, which initially led to calls for stricter gun control.

I should note the key statistics: 52% of Americans prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up from 45% after Sandy Hook. Among blacks, 54% see guns as protective, up from 29%. This is a significant change. Also, the article mentions a decline in support for gun control from 66% in the late 90s to 46% now.

The moral framing here is about the right to bear arms versus public safety. The article contrasts the government's attempt to control versus individual rights. I should highlight the shift in attitudes, the demographic changes, and the ongoing debate between gun control supporters and rights advocates.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the main points without losing the moral angle. I'll structure it by first stating the overall trend, then break down the demographic shifts, and conclude with the implications of the survey's wording and the broader debate.

I should also mention the political divide, as gun rights supporters rally against restrictions, and the specific policies like background checks that have majority support. The mention of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence's point about survey wording adds another layer to the moral debate, suggesting that phrasing influences public perception.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the general trend, moving into specifics, and ending with the implications of the findings. I'll avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey, reflecting a significant shift in public opinion since the 2012 Newtown school shooting. The survey found that 52% of Americans prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up 7 percentage points from post-Newtown levels. This shift is particularly notable among black Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective, compared to 29% just two years ago. The change comes amid ongoing debates over gun control, with President Obama advocating for stricter regulations, while gun rights supporters have successfully blocked federal legislation. The survey highlights a sharp partisan divide, with Democrats generally favoring gun control, while majorities of Republicans and independents prioritize gun rights. Support for specific measures like universal background checks remains strong, but restrictions on rifles and magazines have less support. The survey's wording, emphasizing "rights" over "control," may have influenced results, suggesting a moral framing of individual freedoms versus public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
