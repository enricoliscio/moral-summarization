SUMMARY:

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in American attitudes towards gun rights, with 52% of respondents believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control, a 7% increase from 2012. This marks the highest approval rating in two decades. Notably, black Americans have dramatically changed their views, with 54% now seeing firearms as a public safety benefit, up from 29% two years ago. The survey's findings suggest a partisan divide, with Democrats still backing gun controls, while Republicans and independents prioritize Second Amendment rights. Despite this shift, supporters of gun control argue that specific measures, such as universal background checks, still enjoy strong public support. The survey's results are a stark contrast to the national mood following the 2012 Newtown school shooting, which sparked calls for stricter gun laws. Instead, gun rights advocates have successfully pushed back against such efforts.
