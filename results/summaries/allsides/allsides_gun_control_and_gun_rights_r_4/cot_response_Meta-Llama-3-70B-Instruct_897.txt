SUMMARY:
According to the Pew Research Center, support for gun rights has reached a two-decade high, with 52% of Americans believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a stunning turnaround since the Newtown school shooting in 2012, when President Obama called for major new restrictions on gun rights. Instead, gun rights supporters rallied, blocking efforts to impose new restrictions. Now, a majority of Americans, including 54% of black Americans, view guns as a public safety boon, protecting people from being victims of crimes. Democrats, however, remain committed to imposing new restrictions, citing the imperative to act. The shift in support for gun rights has occurred across nearly all demographic lines, with men, women, old, young, white, and black Americans all increasingly likely to prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control.
