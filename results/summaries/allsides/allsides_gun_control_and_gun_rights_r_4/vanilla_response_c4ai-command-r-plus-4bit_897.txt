SUMMARY: According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, support for gun rights in the US is at its highest level in two decades, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This shift in attitude is notable given the increased focus on gun control following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The change is driven partly by changing views among Black Americans, with more believing that firearms enhance public safety. The survey also revealed a sharp partisan divide on the issue, with Democrats generally favoring gun control and Republicans and independents prioritizing gun rights. While gun control advocates argue that specific wording may influence results, the shift in support for gun rights is evident across various demographic groups. Overall, the findings suggest a significant turnaround in public opinion on gun rights and gun control in the US.
