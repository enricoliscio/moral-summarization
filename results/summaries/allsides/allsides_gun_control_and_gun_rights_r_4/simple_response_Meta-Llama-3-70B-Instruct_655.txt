SUMMARY:

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in American attitudes towards gun rights, with 52% of respondents prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, a 7-point increase from 2012. This marks the highest approval rating in two decades. Notably, black Americans have dramatically changed their views, with 54% now believing guns protect people from crime, up from 29% in 2012. Despite the 2012 Newtown school shooting, which sparked calls for stricter gun laws, gun rights supporters have successfully blocked federal legislation. While Democrats remain committed to imposing new restrictions, the survey highlights a partisan divide on the issue. The shift in public opinion is attributed to changing attitudes across demographic lines, with men, women, old, young, white, and black Americans increasingly supporting Second Amendment rights.
