SUMMARY: Americans' support for gun rights is on the rise, with 52% prioritizing the Second Amendment over gun control, according to Pew Research Center. This shift in attitude, even among black Americans, is surprising given the tragic Newtown school shooting that left 20 children and six faculty dead just two years ago. The shooting, carried out by 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza, sparked calls for stricter gun control measures by President Obama. However, gun rights supporters successfully blocked these efforts, reflecting a sharp partisan divide on the issue. While the wording of surveys can influence results, the shift in public opinion is evident across demographic lines. Men, women, young, old, black, and white Americans all show increased support for gun rights, with a notable exception among Hispanics. Democrats remain divided, while Republicans and independents firmly support the Second Amendment. Gun control supporters argue that specific wording may influence results and that other polls show strong support for background checks and limits on rifles and ammunition magazines. Despite their efforts, the debate has stalled in Congress, leaving states to take the lead on gun control. The recent shift in public opinion is a striking turnaround from the sentiment after the Newtown tragedy, where a gunman shot and killed innocent people before turning the gun on himself in suicide.
