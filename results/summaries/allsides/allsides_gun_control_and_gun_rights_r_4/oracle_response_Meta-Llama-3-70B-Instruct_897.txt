SUMMARY:

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in Americans' attitudes towards gun rights, with 52% now prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, a 7-point increase from two years ago. This turnaround is particularly notable given the devastating Newtown school shooting in 2012, which left 20 schoolchildren and six faculty members dead. The survey also highlights a dramatic change in black Americans' views, with 54% now believing firearms protect people from being victims of crimes, up from 29% two years ago. Despite the push for stricter gun control measures, including universal background checks and bans on high-capacity ammunition magazines and military-style rifles, gun rights supporters have successfully blocked efforts in Congress. The debate remains polarized, with Democrats committed to imposing new restrictions, citing the need to act against gun violence. The survey's findings suggest a sharp partisan divide, with majorities of Republicans and independents prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control.
