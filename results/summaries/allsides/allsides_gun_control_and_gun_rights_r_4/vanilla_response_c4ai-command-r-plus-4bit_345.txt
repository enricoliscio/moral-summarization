SUMMARY: A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals that support for gun rights in the US is at its highest level in two decades, with 52% of Americans prioritizing the Second Amendment over gun control. This shift in attitude is notable given the national outcry for gun control reforms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. The increase in gun rights support is driven partly by changing views among Black Americans, with more believing that firearms enhance public safety. While Democrats continue to advocate for gun control, Republicans and independents largely favor the Second Amendment. This trend transcends demographic boundaries, with men, women, young, old, Black, and White Americans all showing increased support for gun rights. Despite the shift towards gun rights, gun control advocates point to other polls indicating strong support for specific reforms, such as universal background checks. The wording of the Pew survey may also have influenced results, as the notion of "rights" versus "control" could sway responses. Overall, the survey highlights a notable shift in public opinion on gun rights since the 1990s.
