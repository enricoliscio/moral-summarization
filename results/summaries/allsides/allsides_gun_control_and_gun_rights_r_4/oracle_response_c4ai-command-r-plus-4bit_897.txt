SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the US has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, marking a significant shift in public opinion since the tragic Newtown school shooting in 2012 that left 20 children and six adults dead. The poll found that 52% of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, reflecting a 7-point increase since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. This shift is attributed in part to changing attitudes among Black Americans, who increasingly view guns as a means of protection against crimes. The findings highlight a stark partisan divide on the issue, with Democrats generally favoring gun control measures while Republicans and independents strongly support gun rights. While gun control advocates point to other polls showing strong support for specific restrictions, such as universal background checks, the Pew survey suggests a broader trend towards prioritizing gun rights over controls. This shift is evident across demographic lines, with men, women, young, old, Black, and White Americans all showing increased support for Second Amendment rights. The rise in gun rights support comes despite high-profile shootings and efforts by President Obama and Democrats to enact stricter gun control laws. The survey's results underscore the complex and deeply moral nature of the gun control debate in American society. END OF SUMMARY.
