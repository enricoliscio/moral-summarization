SUMMARY:

According to the Pew Research Center, support for gun rights has surged to its highest level in decades, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This marks a stark turnaround from just two years ago, following the devastating Newtown school shooting that left 20 schoolchildren and six faculty members dead. The shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, who increasingly view guns as a means to protect people from being victims of crimes. In 2012, only 29% of blacks believed guns promoted public safety, but now 54% hold this view. Despite President Obama's calls for stricter gun control measures, gun rights supporters have rallied, blocking federal efforts. Democrats remain committed to imposing new restrictions, citing the imperative to act against gun violence. The survey's findings reflect a partisan divide, with 90% of Americans supporting universal background checks and 50% backing limits on rifles and ammunition magazines. END OF SUMMARY.
