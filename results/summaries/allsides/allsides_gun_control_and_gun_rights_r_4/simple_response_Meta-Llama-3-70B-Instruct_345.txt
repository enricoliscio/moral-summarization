SUMMARY:

According to the latest Pew Research Center data, support for gun rights has reached a two-decade high, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This marks a stunning turnaround since the Newtown school shooting in 2012. Notably, black Americans' views on gun ownership have shifted dramatically, with 54% now believing firearms protect people from crime, up from 29% two years ago. The survey's findings reflect a sharp partisan divide, with Democrats still backing gun controls, while Republicans and independents prioritize gun rights. Despite this shift, support for specific changes, such as universal background checks, remains strong. The moral imperative to act on gun violence, emphasized by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, seems to be losing traction amidst the growing support for gun rights.

END OF SUMMARY.
