SUMMARY:

According to a Pew Research Center survey, support for gun rights has reached a two-decade high, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This marks a 7-point increase since the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Notably, attitudes among black Americans have shifted dramatically, with 54% now believing firearms protect people from crime, up from 29% two years ago. Despite this, Democrats remain committed to imposing new gun restrictions. While support for specific measures like universal background checks remains high, the survey's wording may have influenced results. The shift in support for gun rights is seen across demographic lines, with men, women, old, young, white, and black Americans all increasing their support over the last two years.

END OF SUMMARY.
