SUMMARY:
Gun rights advocates have seen a surge in support over the past two years, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control, according to Pew Research Center. This shift in public opinion, even among black Americans, presents a striking contrast to the aftermath of the tragic Newtown school shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead. Despite calls for stricter gun control measures by President Obama and Democrats, the Senate blocked these efforts. Shifting attitudes toward gun rights are evident across demographics, with majorities of men, women, young, old, black, and white individuals favoring Second Amendment rights. The support for gun rights among Hispanics, however, has slightly declined. While gun control supporters argue for specific changes like universal background checks, the issue remains deeply divided along partisan lines. The wording of surveys can also influence results, as questions framed around "rights" versus "control" may sway responses. Nonetheless, the shift in public opinion underscores the challenge faced by gun control advocates in their efforts to impose restrictions and protect communities from gun violence.
