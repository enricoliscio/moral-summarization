SUMMARY:
Support for gun rights is at its highest in two decades, with 52% of Americans prioritizing the Second Amendment over gun control. This shift in attitude is driven by changing views among Black Americans, who increasingly see firearms as good for public safety. Pew Research Center's latest data reveals a stunning turnaround from the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where gun control efforts were advocated by President Obama and others. Despite blocked attempts in the Senate and partisan divides, the issue remains salient for Democrats, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi emphasizing the imperative to act. Gun control supporters highlight the enduring support for specific changes, such as universal background checks, while also acknowledging the influence of wording in shaping survey results. The research also highlights a broader shift over time, with gun control support peaking in the late 1990s and gradually declining since then. This shift transcends demographic lines, with men, women, young, old, Black, White, Republican, and Democrat respondents all showing increased support for gun rights in the last two years. The exception is Hispanics, whose support for gun rights has slightly decreased. The debate between prioritizing gun rights and imposing gun control measures persists, with the latest data revealing a significant shift in public sentiment.
