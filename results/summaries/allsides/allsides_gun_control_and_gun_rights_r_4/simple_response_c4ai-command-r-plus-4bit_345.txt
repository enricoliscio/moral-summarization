SUMMARY: Americans are increasingly supporting gun rights, with 52% prioritizing the Second Amendment over gun control, a stunning turnaround from the sentiment after the Newtown school shooting. This shift is driven by changing attitudes among Black Americans, who view guns as a means of public safety. Despite calls for gun control after tragic mass shootings, such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, gun rights supporters have successfully blocked efforts for stricter regulations. While gun control advocates argue that specific wording in surveys may influence results, the shift in public opinion is evident across demographic lines. Overall, Americans, especially Black Americans, are embracing gun rights as a means to protect themselves and their communities.
