Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about how support for gun rights in the US has increased, especially among black Americans, despite the Newtown shooting. 

I notice the author uses words like "shooting," "dead," "crimes," "killed," "drove," "shot," "suicide," and "violence." These are all morally charged terms that highlight the tragic events and their impact. I need to make sure my summary includes these words where appropriate.

The key points are the rise in support for the Second Amendment, the shift in black Americans' attitudes, the failed gun control legislation, and the ongoing debate. I should structure the summary to reflect these points clearly, using the morally framed words to maintain the original tone.

I'll start by stating the increase in support, mention the Newtown shooting and its aftermath, then discuss the demographic shifts, especially among African-Americans. I'll include the failed Senate bills and the current stance of Democrats. I'll also note the specific polling numbers and the Coalition's perspective on survey wording. Finally, I'll conclude with the overall shift across demographics and the ongoing debate.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points and use the moral terms to emphasize the gravity of the situation.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to Pew Research Center data, reflecting a significant shift in public opinion since the Newtown school shooting in 2012. The percentage of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control rose to 52%, up from 45% after the Sandy Hook tragedy. This shift is particularly notable among black Americans, with 54% now viewing firearms as protective against crime, compared to just 29% two years ago. The Newtown shooting, where 26 were killed, including 20 children, initially sparked calls for stricter gun laws, but efforts to pass federal legislation stalled. Gun control supporters emphasize strong backing for universal background checks, while gun rights advocates rally behind protecting constitutional rights. The survey highlights a sharp partisan divide, with Democrats favoring gun control and Republicans and independents prioritizing Second Amendment rights. Despite the shift, specific measures like banning high-capacity weapons remain contentious. The moral framing underscores the tragedy of shootings, deaths, and violence, while highlighting the ongoing debate over rights and safety. END OF SUMMARY.
