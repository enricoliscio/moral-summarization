Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about a Pew Research Center survey showing increased support for gun rights in the U.S., especially among black Americans. 

So, the main points are: support for gun rights is at its highest in two decades, up from 45% to 52% since the Sandy Hook shooting. Black Americans' support has jumped from 29% to 54% in seeing guns as protective. The article mentions that President Obama pushed for gun control after Sandy Hook, but efforts were blocked. There's also a mention of the partisan divide and how the survey's wording might influence results.

I should structure the summary to include the key findings, the demographic shifts, the political context, and the implications. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to highlight the significant increase in support and the factors behind it, like the change in black Americans' attitudes. Also, note that while support for universal background checks is high, other measures are less so. The partisan divide is important too, as well as the shift across different demographics except Hispanics.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the overall trend, then breaking down the demographics, the political actions, and the implications. I should avoid getting too detailed on each point but cover all essential aspects succinctly.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun controlâ€”a 7% increase since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. This shift is particularly notable among black Americans, with 54% now viewing guns as protective, up from 29% two years ago. President Obama's push for stricter gun laws after Sandy Hook failed, and while some states acted, federal efforts stalled. Gun control supporters highlight strong backing for universal background checks (90%), though support for rifle and magazine restrictions is lower (just over 50%). The survey reflects a partisan divide, with Republicans and independents favoring gun rights, while Democrats lean toward control. Overall, support for gun rights has increased across most demographics, except among Hispanics, whose support dropped slightly. END OF SUMMARY.
