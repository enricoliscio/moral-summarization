Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about the increase in support for gun rights in the US, according to a Pew Research Center study. The article mentions that support has risen significantly since the Newtown shooting, especially among black Americans. There's also a mention of political reactions and the wording of surveys influencing results.

The user has given a specific structure to follow: first, identify all the morally framed single words, then write a summary preserving those words. The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many moral terms as possible.

For step one, I need to go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "support," "rights," "control," "protect," "safety," "boon," "stalled," "commitment," "imperative," "appealing," "free," "sensible," "trumps." These words are framed morally because they relate to values, rights, and responsibilities.

Now, for the summary, I should start by stating the main point: increased support for gun rights. Then mention the Pew study, the shift in attitudes, especially among black Americans. Include the political context, like Obama's call for restrictions and the Senate's blocking. Highlight the specific support for universal background checks and the partisan divide. Finally, note the overall shift across demographics and the decline among Hispanics. Make sure to include all the moral words identified.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, is under 200 words, and includes all the key points with the moral framing intact. Let me piece it together, making sure each sentence incorporates the necessary terms without making it sound forced.

**STEP 1:**  
* support  
* rights  
* control  
* protect  
* safety  
* boon  
* stalled  
* commitment  
* imperative  
* appealing  
* free  
* sensible  
* trumps  

**SUMMARY:**  
Support for gun rights has surged to its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center study, reflecting a dramatic shift in public opinion since the Newtown school shooting. A majority of Americans now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, with black Americans increasingly viewing firearms as protective rather than a public safety risk. This shift comes despite President Obama's calls for stricter gun laws and the stalled legislative efforts in Congress. While specific measures like universal background checks remain widely supported, the survey highlights a partisan divide, with Republicans and independents favoring gun rights over controls. The study also reveals a decline in support for gun rights among Hispanics, while other demographics, including whites, have seen a rise. The moral framing of the issue, particularly the emphasis on "rights" versus "control," underscores the ideological divide in the ongoing debate. END OF SUMMARY.
