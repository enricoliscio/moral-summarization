Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words: shooting, dead, crimes, killed, drove, shot, suicide, violence. I should make sure to include as many of these as possible in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key points are the increase in support for gun rights after the Newtown shooting, the shift in attitudes among black Americans, and the impact of the Sandy Hook shooting on public opinion.

I should start by stating the increase in support for gun rights, using "shooting" and "dead" from the article. Then mention the change in black Americans' views, using "crimes" and "protect." I'll also include the Sandy Hook details, using "killed," "drove," "shot," and "suicide."

Next, I'll note the political response, including Obama's call for restrictions and the subsequent legislative block. I should use "gun control" and "restrictions" as they relate to the moral framing.

I'll also address the polling results, emphasizing the support for universal background checks and the partisan divide. The mention of the survey's wording and the alternative phrasing can highlight the moral perspective on rights versus control.

Finally, I'll summarize the demographic shifts, ensuring to include all groups and their changing support levels. I'll end with the overall trend showing a significant shift towards gun rights.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while incorporating the moral words. I'll structure it in a way that each paragraph covers a main point, ensuring clarity and coherence.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights has surged to its highest level in two decades, according to Pew Research Center, reflecting a dramatic shift in public opinion since the Newtown school shooting. A majority of Americans (52%) now prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up 7 percentage points since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, where 20 children and six faculty were killed. This shift is driven by changing attitudes among black Americans, with 54% now viewing guns as protective against crime, compared to 29% two years ago. The Newtown tragedy, where gunman Adam Lanza killed his mother, drove to the school, shot 26 people, and committed suicide, initially sparked calls for stricter gun control. President Obama pushed for federal restrictions, but gun rights advocates blocked these efforts, leaving the issue stalled. Despite this, support for specific measures like universal background checks remains strong, with 90% of Americans backing them. However, Pew’s findings reveal a sharp partisan divide, with Republicans and independents prioritizing gun rights over controls. African-Americans’ support for gun rights rose from 24% to 34%, while whites’ support increased from 53% to 61%. Only Hispanics saw a slight decline. The shift underscores a broader trend toward valuing Second Amendment rights, even as the debate over gun violence persists. END OF SUMMARY.
