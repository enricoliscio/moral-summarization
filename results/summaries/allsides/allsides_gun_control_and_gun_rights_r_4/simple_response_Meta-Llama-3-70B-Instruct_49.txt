SUMMARY:

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in American attitudes towards gun rights, with 52% of respondents believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a 7-point increase from 2012, following the Newtown school shooting. Notably, black Americans' views on gun ownership have dramatically changed, with 54% now seeing firearms as a public safety benefit, up from 29% two years ago. Despite this trend, gun control supporters argue that other polling shows strong support for specific measures, such as universal background checks. The survey's wording has been questioned, with some arguing that framing the question in terms of "rights" versus "control" may have influenced the results. The shift in public opinion has occurred across demographic lines, with majorities of men, women, old, young, white, and black Americans increasingly supporting gun rights.
