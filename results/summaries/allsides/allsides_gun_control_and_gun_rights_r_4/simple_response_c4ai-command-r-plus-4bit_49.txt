SUMMARY: Support for gun rights is at a two-decade high in the US, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, highlighting a shift in attitudes since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. The survey found that 52% of Americans prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, with increasing support among Black Americans, who view guns as essential for public safety. This shift is notable given the national debate on gun control sparked by the Sandy Hook tragedy, which left 26 people dead, including 20 children. Despite calls for stricter gun control laws by President Obama and Democrats, gun rights supporters have successfully blocked these efforts, showcasing the enduring divide on this issue. While gun control advocates point to other polls showing strong support for specific measures like universal background checks, the Pew survey suggests a broader shift in attitudes, with support for gun control at a two-decade low. This shift is evident across demographics, with men, women, young, old, Black, and White Americans all showing increased support for Second Amendment rights. The findings underscore the complex and evolving nature of the gun rights debate in America, where the right to bear arms and public safety concerns continue to shape public opinion and policy. END OF SUMMARY.
