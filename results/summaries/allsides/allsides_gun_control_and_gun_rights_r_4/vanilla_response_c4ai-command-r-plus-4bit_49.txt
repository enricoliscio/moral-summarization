SUMMARY: According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, support for gun rights in the United States is at its highest level in two decades, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This shift in public opinion is notable given the increased focus on gun control following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. The survey also reveals a change in attitudes among African Americans, with more believing that firearms enhance public safety. The shift in opinion is widespread, with men, women, young and old, and people of different racial backgrounds all showing increased support for gun rights. While Democrats still largely favor gun control, Republicans and independents overwhelmingly prioritize gun rights. The findings highlight a sharp partisan divide on the issue, with gun control supporters advocating for specific measures such as universal background checks and limits on ammunition magazines and rifles. Despite the shift towards gun rights, support for specific gun control measures remains strong, indicating a complex and nuanced public opinion on the issue.
