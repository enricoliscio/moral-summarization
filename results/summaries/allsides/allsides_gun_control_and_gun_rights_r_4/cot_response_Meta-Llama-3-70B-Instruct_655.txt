SUMMARY:
According to the Pew Research Center, support for gun rights has reached a two-decade high, with 52% of Americans believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a stunning turnaround since the Newtown school shooting in 2012. Notably, black Americans have dramatically shifted their views, with 54% now seeing firearms as a public safety boon, up from 29% two years ago. Despite this, gun control supporters remain committed to imposing new restrictions, citing the imperative to act. The partisan divide on the issue remains sharp, with Democrats generally backing gun controls, while Republicans and independents prioritize Second Amendment rights. The shift in public opinion has occurred across demographic lines, with men, women, old, and young all increasingly supporting gun rights. END OF SUMMARY.
