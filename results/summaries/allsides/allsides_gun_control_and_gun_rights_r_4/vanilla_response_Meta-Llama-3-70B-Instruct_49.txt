SUMMARY:

According to the latest data from the Pew Research Center, support for gun rights has reached its highest level in two decades, with 52% of Americans believing that Second Amendment rights are more important than gun control. This marks a 7 percentage point increase since the Newtown school shooting in 2012. The shift is driven in part by changing attitudes among black Americans, who are increasingly likely to view guns as good for public safety. The survey found that 54% of blacks now believe firearms protect people from being victims of crimes, up from 29% two years ago. While Democrats remain committed to imposing new gun restrictions, the data suggests a sharp partisan divide on the issue. Despite this, support for specific changes, such as universal background checks, remains high. The findings reflect a shift over time, with support for gun control peaking in the late 1990s and dropping 20 percentage points since then.

END OF SUMMARY.
