Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about a Pew Research Center survey showing increased support for gun rights in the U.S., especially among black Americans. It mentions that support is the highest in two decades, up from after the Sandy Hook shooting. There's a significant shift in African-Americans' views, with more seeing guns as protective rather than a risk. The article also discusses the political response, with Obama pushing for gun control post-Newtown, but efforts being blocked by gun rights supporters. It notes that while some states acted, federal legislation stalled. Polling shows high support for universal background checks but mixed on other measures. The summary should highlight the shift in public opinion, the demographic changes, and the political implications, preserving the moral aspects like safety and rights.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral framing. I'll structure it by mentioning the increase in support, the demographic breakdown, the political context, and the implications of the survey's wording.

SUMMARY: A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals a significant shift in American attitudes toward gun rights, with 52% prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun controlâ€”a 7% increase since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. This surge is driven by changing views among black Americans, with 54% now seeing firearms as protective, up from 29% two years ago. The shift reflects a broader trend across demographics, with support rising among men, women, whites, and independents, while Hispanics saw a slight decline. Despite President Obama's push for stricter gun laws after Newtown, federal efforts stalled, highlighting a partisan divide. Gun control advocates note strong support for universal background checks, but other measures face mixed backing. The survey's wording, emphasizing "rights" over "control," may influence results, suggesting a moral framing favoring individual freedoms over collective safety. END OF SUMMARY.
