Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the shift in support for gun rights in the US. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first.

The article mentions that according to Pew Research, support for gun rights is at its highest in two decades, up 7% since the Sandy Hook shooting. It's interesting that this change is partly due to African Americans increasingly seeing guns as beneficial for public safety. The article also talks about the Newtown shooting and the subsequent push for gun control by President Obama, which didn't succeed. There's a mention of the partisan divide and how the wording of the survey might have influenced the results.

I should make sure to include the key points: the increase in support, the role of African Americans, the failed gun control push, the partisan divide, and the survey's wording impact. I need to keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral perspective, highlighting the debate's ethical dimensions.

Let me structure it: start with the main finding, mention the demographic shift, the failed legislation, the current support levels, and the survey's wording effect. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and captures the essence without losing the moral angle.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to Pew Research Center, with 52% of Americans prioritizing Second Amendment rights over gun control. This shift, up 7 percentage points since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, reflects changing attitudes, particularly among Black Americans, who now view guns as protective for public safety. In 2023, 54% of Black Americans believe firearms protect against crime, compared to 29% two years ago. The shift is notable given the post-Newtown push for stricter gun laws, which stalled in Congress despite strong public support for universal background checks (90%) and limits on rifles (50%). The survey's wording—asking about "controlling gun ownership" vs. "protecting the right to own guns"—may have influenced results, as the concept of "rights" is more appealing than "control." Support for gun rights has increased across demographics, except for Hispanics, whose support dropped slightly. While Democrats lean toward gun control, majorities of Republicans and independents prioritize Second Amendment rights. END OF SUMMARY.
