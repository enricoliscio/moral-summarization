Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about a shift in American support for gun rights, according to a Pew Research Center survey. It mentions that support is at its highest in two decades, up from after the Sandy Hook shooting. There's a significant change among black Americans, with more viewing guns as protective. The article also discusses the political response, with Obama pushing for gun control and the Senate blocking those efforts. Gun control supporters still have strong backing for universal background checks, but other measures are less supported. The survey's wording is criticized for favoring gun rights, and there's a noted shift across all demographics except Hispanics. Democrats mostly support gun control, while Republicans and independents favor gun rights.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, preserving the moral framing. The user is a news summarizer and moral expert, so I should highlight the moral implications, like the shift in public safety views and the political debate's impact.

I'll start by mentioning the increase in gun rights support, the demographic shifts, and the political actions. I should include the criticism of the survey's wording and the ongoing debate. I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all key points succinctly.

Let me structure it: start with the overall trend, mention the demographic changes, touch on the political response and its outcomes, include the criticism of the survey, and end with the ongoing debate. That should cover the moral aspects and the main data points.

SUMMARY: Support for gun rights in the U.S. has reached its highest level in two decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey, reflecting a significant shift in public opinion since the 2012 Newtown school shooting. The survey found that 52% of Americans prioritize Second Amendment rights over gun control, up 7 percentage points from post-Sandy Hook levels. This shift is particularly notable among black Americans, with 54% now viewing guns as protective, compared to 29% just two years ago. The change comes amid stalled federal gun control efforts, as President Obama's push for stricter laws was blocked by gun rights advocates. While support for universal background checks remains strong at 90%, other measures like banning high-capacity weapons have less backing. Critics argue the survey's wording may have skewed results, emphasizing "rights" over "control." The shift in support spans most demographics, with African Americans and whites increasing their backing of gun rights, while Hispanic support slightly declined. Democrats mostly favor gun control, but majorities of Republicans and independents prioritize gun rights. The debate highlights a growing partisan divide and the enduring challenge of balancing public safety with constitutional rights. END OF SUMMARY.
