SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person with the intent to demean or harass is illegal and could result in fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, simply using the term on the street is not illegal. The broad interpretation of the law has raised concerns about its constitutionality under the First Amendment, as it may prohibit free speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination. The government must balance the protection of undocumented people with the free speech rights of individuals. According to attorney Hans Bader, even the federal standard of "severe or pervasive" harassment may not sufficiently protect speech, making it concerning that New York City has expanded liability beyond this standard. The article emphasizes the need for a balance between protecting undocumented individuals and preserving free speech rights.
