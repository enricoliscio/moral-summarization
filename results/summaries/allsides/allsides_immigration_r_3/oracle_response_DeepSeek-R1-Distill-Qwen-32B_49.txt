Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible without exceeding 200 words.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It's about NYC's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using "illegal alien" can be illegal under anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. The author argues this might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment because the law's interpretation is too broad.

Now, I need to identify the key moral terms: interpretation, used, demean, humiliate, harass, harassment, going, signal, problem, guidance, decrees, prohibit, come, make, eliminated, statements, satisfy. I'll incorporate these into the summary.

I should start by stating the Commission's action, then mention the potential constitutional issue. Highlight that the guidance targets speech meant to demean or humiliate, and note the broad scope. Then, explain the author's concern about the elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard, making it too restrictive. Conclude by emphasizing the balance between anti-discrimination and free speech.

I'll structure the summary to flow logically, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate. I'll keep sentences concise to stay within the word limit. Let me draft the summary, checking each point and the inclusion of the required terms.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has interpreted anti-discrimination laws to prohibit the use of the term "illegal alien" when used to demean, humiliate, or harass undocumented individuals, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. This guidance, however, may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it broadly restricts speech without sufficient limiting conditions. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not to casual use of the term on the street. The commission's 30-page guidance eliminates the federal standard requiring harassment to be severe or pervasive, making even a single comment potentially illegal. Critics argue this broad interpretation could prohibit politically incorrect statements about undocumented people, violating free speech protections. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with First Amendment rights to avoid overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
