Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about New York City's Commission on Human Rights and their stance on the term "illegal alien." Let me read through the article first.

The article says that the Commission declared using "illegal alien" pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines up to $250,000. But some argue this might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. They mention that the law protects against workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not all speech, like calling someone that on the street. The guidance is detailed in a 30-page document, and it's noted that even a single comment could be harassment. An attorney, Hans Bader, points out that this might be too broad, as federal law requires harassment to be severe or pervasive, which NYC has eliminated, possibly making it unconstitutional. The article ends by saying the government can't just ban politically incorrect statements without proper limits.

So, the summary needs to capture the main points: the Commission's ruling, the potential constitutional issue, the scope of the law, the concern about free speech, and the attorney's perspective.

I should structure it clearly, maybe start with the Commission's action, then the criticism about constitutionality, the scope of the law, and the implications on free speech. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft a few sentences:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights ruled that using "illegal alien" pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. Critics argue this may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not all speech. The guidance states even a single comment could be harassment, which some say is too broad. Attorney Hans Bader notes federal law requires harassment to be severe or pervasive, a standard NYC has removed, possibly infringing on free speech. The government can't ban politically incorrect speech without proper limits.

That's about 100 words. I can add a bit more detail to reach closer to 200 without being too lengthy.

Wait, the article also mentions that merely calling someone that on the street isn't illegal, so I should include that. Also, the 30-page guidance is a key point.

So, revised:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights ruled that using the term "illegal alien" pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. Critics argue the ruling may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not all speech. For example, calling someone an "illegal alien" on the street or threatening to contact ICE isn't illegal. The 30-page guidance states that even a single comment could constitute harassment, a standard that some argue is too broad. Attorney Hans Bader points out that federal law requires harassment to be severe or pervasive, a standard NYC has removed, potentially infringing on free speech. The government can't simply prohibit politically incorrect speech without proper limits, he argues.

That's about 120 words. Maybe add a sentence about the implications.

Alternatively, combine some points:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights ruled that using "illegal alien" pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. Critics argue this may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations but not all speech, like calling someone that on the street. The guidance states even a single comment could be harassment, a standard some say is too broad. Attorney Hans Bader notes federal law requires harassment to be severe or pervasive, which NYC has removed, possibly infringing on free speech. The government can't ban politically incorrect speech without limits, he argues.

That's concise and covers all main points. I think this should be under 200 words.
