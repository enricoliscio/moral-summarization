Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The article is about NYC's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" can be illegal under certain circumstances, potentially leading to fines. There's a debate about whether this is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

The user emphasized preserving the moral words like "interpretation," "demean," "harass," etc. So, I need to make sure those words are included in the summary. I should also keep the summary under 200 words and structure it after the "SUMMARY:" token.

I'll start by identifying the key points: the declaration by the Commission, the potential unconstitutionality, the protected category, the scope of the law, and the concerns about free speech. Then, I'll use the moral words to frame these points, ensuring the summary is concise and captures the essence of the article's argument.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has interpreted the term "illegal alien" as potentially illegal when used to demean, humiliate, or harass undocumented individuals, citing anti-discrimination laws. This interpretation could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue that the city's broad guidance may violate the First Amendment, as it eliminates the "severe or pervasive" standard required for harassment under federal law. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not to casual use of the term on the street. The commission's guidance signals a problematic expansion of anti-discrimination mandates, potentially prohibiting politically incorrect statements without sufficient limits on free speech. The government must balance anti-discrimination efforts with First Amendment protections to satisfy constitutional requirements. END OF SUMMARY.
