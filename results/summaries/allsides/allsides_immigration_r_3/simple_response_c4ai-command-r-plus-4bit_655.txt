SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented individual with the intent to demean, humiliate, or harass is illegal and could result in significant fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, it raises concerns about potentially infringing on free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. The commission's guidance is broad and prohibits even a single comment made by an employer that signals discriminatory views about immigration status or national origin. This goes beyond the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law and sets a precedent that may discourage politically incorrect but necessary conversations about undocumented individuals. Attorney Hans Bader argues that the government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with free speech protections to ensure that people's rights to express their views, however unpopular, are not infringed upon. The challenge is to strike a balance between upholding anti-discrimination laws and preserving the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all citizens. 

END OF SUMMARY.
