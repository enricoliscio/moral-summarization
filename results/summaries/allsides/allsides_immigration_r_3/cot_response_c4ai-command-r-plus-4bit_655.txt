SUMMARY:
The New York City Commission on Human Rights has issued a guidance that using the term "illegal alien" with the intention of harassing, humiliating, or demeaning an undocumented individual is illegal and could result in hefty fines. While this guidance aims to protect individuals from discriminatory practices in the workplace, tenant settings, and public accommodations, it raises concerns about the limitations it imposes on free speech. The courts have generally upheld anti-discrimination ordinances, even when they seem to limit the free speech rights of employers and landlords. However, the commission's broad interpretation of the law, which suggests that even a single comment could constitute harassment, may push it into unconstitutional territory. Legal experts argue that prohibiting certain speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination must be balanced with free speech guarantees. They assert that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals but must also respect the broad free speech rights that all individuals are entitled to.
