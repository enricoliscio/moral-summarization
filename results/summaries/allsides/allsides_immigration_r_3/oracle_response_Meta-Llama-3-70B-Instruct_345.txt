SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" in a derogatory manner to demean, humiliate, or harass undocumented individuals is illegal and can result in fines of up to $250,000. However, the commission's interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment made with intent to harass or signal discriminatory views can be considered harassment, which raises concerns about the scope of anti-discrimination mandates. Critics argue that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals and must limit the scope of anti-discrimination laws to satisfy broad free speech guarantees. The guidance's elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law is particularly alarming, as it may lead to unconstitutional restrictions on free speech. Ultimately, the city's approach may create more problems than it solves.

END OF SUMMARY.
