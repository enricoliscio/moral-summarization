SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued guidance stating that using the term "illegal alien" with the intent to demean or harass an undocumented person is illegal and could result in fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, simply using the term in a public setting would not be illegal. The courts have generally upheld anti-discrimination ordinances, but NYC's guidance may push the boundaries of what is constitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment by an employer could be enough to constitute harassment, which could be problematic as government restrictions on free speech must come with limiting conditions to pass a First Amendment test. The Supreme Court has held that conduct must be severe or pervasive to be legally considered harassment, but NYC's guidance eliminates this limitation. Hans Bader, an attorney, warns that the city's broad interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional and that anti-discrimination mandates must be balanced with free speech guarantees.
