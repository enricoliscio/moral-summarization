SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued guidance stating that using the term "illegal alien" with the intent to demean or harass an undocumented person is illegal under the city's Human Rights Law. While the law covers workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation, it does not prohibit all uses of the term. The courts have generally upheld anti-discrimination ordinances, even if they limit free speech rights. However, NYC's guidance goes beyond this by stating that even a single comment made by an employer could constitute harassment, which may push it into unconstitutional territory. The First Amendment protects free speech, and government decrees prohibiting certain speech must come with limiting conditions to pass constitutional muster. Attorney Hans Bader argues that NYC's guidance does not provide sufficient protection for speech and may be found to violate the First Amendment. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all individuals.
