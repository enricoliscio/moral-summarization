SUMMARY: 
New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued a guidance that using the term "illegal alien" with the intent to *demean*, *humiliate*, or *harass* an undocumented person is considered *violations* of the city's anti-*discrimination* laws and could result in significant fines. While the guidance is limited to workplace *harassment*, tenants' rights, and public accommodation, it has sparked concerns over its potential *unconstitutionality* under the First Amendment. The city's interpretation of the law is broad, and legal experts argue that the prohibition of certain speech must come with limiting conditions to survive a First Amendment test. They contend that the government cannot simply *prohibit* politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals but must also respect the free speech rights guaranteed to all people. The severity or pervasiveness of *harassment* is a critical factor in determining the legality of speech, and NYC's guidance may have pushed the boundaries by eliminating this consideration.
