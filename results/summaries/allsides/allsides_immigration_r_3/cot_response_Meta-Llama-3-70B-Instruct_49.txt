SUMMARY:
The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative manner to describe an undocumented person is illegal and can result in fines of up to $250,000. The commission's guidance notes that even a single comment made with intent to demean, humiliate, or harass a person based on their immigration status or national origin can constitute harassment. However, critics argue that this guidance may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it potentially limits free speech without sufficient limiting conditions. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with broad free speech guarantees, and cannot simply prohibit people from making "politically incorrect" statements about undocumented individuals. The guidance's scope may be too broad, potentially leading to unconstitutional restrictions on speech.
