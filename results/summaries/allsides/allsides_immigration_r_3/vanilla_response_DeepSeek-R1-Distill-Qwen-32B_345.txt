Okay, I need to summarize this news article about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" is illegal. The article mentions that this could lead to fines up to $250,000. Hmm, I should note that the law is part of the Human Rights Law, which protects against discrimination in the workplace, housing, and public accommodations.

Wait, the article also says that the city's interpretation might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. That's a key point. The guidance from the commission specifically targets using the term with intent to demean or harass. But it's important to clarify that not all uses are illegalâ€”like calling someone that on the street isn't covered. Only in specific contexts like workplaces or tenant situations.

The article mentions that the courts have upheld anti-discrimination laws even when they seem to limit free speech. But NYC is taking it further by saying even a single comment could be harassment, which might be too broad. An attorney, Hans Bader, points out that federal law requires harassment to be severe or pervasive, and NYC is removing that standard, which could infringe on free speech.

I should make sure the summary includes that the law doesn't apply to all speech, only specific contexts. Also, highlight the constitutional concern and Bader's argument about the need for limiting conditions to protect free speech.

Putting it all together: the summary should mention the Commission's ruling, the potential fines, the contexts where it applies, the concern about the First Amendment, and the critique from Bader about the lack of a severity standard. Keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenant rights, and public accommodations but does not criminalize casual use of the term on the street or threatening to contact ICE. Critics argue the city's broad interpretation may infringe on First Amendment rights, as it eliminates the federal requirement that harassment be severe or pervasive. Attorney Hans Bader highlights that even the federal standard is narrow, making NYC's approach alarming. The guidance raises concerns about overreach, as it could penalize single comments signaling discriminatory views, potentially violating free speech protections. END OF SUMMARY.
