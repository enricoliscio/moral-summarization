SUMMARY: 
New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued a guidance that using the term "illegal alien" with the intention to demean, humiliate, or harass an undocumented individual is illegal and constitutes discrimination under the law. This guidance extends beyond mere speech, covering workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation. While anti-discrimination ordinances have been upheld in courts, even when appearing to limit free speech rights, NYC's broad interpretation may push it into unconstitutional territory. The guidance states that even a single comment by an employer that signals discriminatory views about immigration status or national origin can be considered harassment, which is problematic as it does not meet the "severe or pervasive" standard required by federal law and may infringe on free speech rights. The government must balance its anti-discrimination mandates with the free speech guarantees enjoyed by all, ensuring that politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals are not simply prohibited but rather limited in scope to satisfy moral and legal obligations.
