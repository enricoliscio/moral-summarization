SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals is illegal and can result in fines of up to $250,000. While the city's Human Rights Law has long protected individuals from discrimination based on perceived immigration status, the commission's new guidance may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance is overly broad, potentially criminalizing single comments made by employers or landlords, even if they are not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. This raises concerns about the limits of free speech and the government's role in regulating speech. As attorney Hans Bader notes, the government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all individuals, and cannot simply prohibit "politically incorrect" statements.

END OF SUMMARY.
