SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person can be considered harassment and discrimination, punishable by fines of up to $250,000. While the law aims to protect employees and tenants from discrimination, critics argue that the city's interpretation is too broad and may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer can be considered harassment, which raises concerns about free speech limits. Experts argue that government decrees to prohibit speech must come with limiting conditions to survive a First Amendment test, and that the city's elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law is alarming. The moral framing of this issue highlights the tension between protecting vulnerable individuals from discrimination and preserving the right to free speech.
