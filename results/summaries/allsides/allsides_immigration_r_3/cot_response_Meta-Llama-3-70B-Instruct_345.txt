SUMMARY:
The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative manner to describe an undocumented person violates laws designed to protect employees and tenants from discrimination. The commission's guidance notes that such language, intended to demean, humiliate, or harass, is illegal and could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue that the city's interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it may limit free speech guarantees. The guidance eliminates the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law, making it alarming that the government is prohibiting people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented people. The courts have held that anti-discrimination ordinances can survive scrutiny, but NYC's broad interpretation may push the guidance into unconstitutional territory. END OF SUMMARY.
