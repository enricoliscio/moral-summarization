Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words to include. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" pejoratively is a violation of anti-discrimination laws. They could fine up to $250,000. The author argues that this interpretation might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The law protects against workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations. However, the guidance is broad, possibly infringing on free speech. The author mentions that even a single comment could be considered harassment, which is problematic because it eliminates the'severe or pervasive' standard, which is necessary to protect free speech.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. The words are: interpretation, used, demean, humiliate, harass, harassment, going, signal, problem, guidance, decrees, prohibit, come, make, eliminated, statements, satisfy.

I need to make sure these words are included where appropriate. Let me outline the key points to cover:

1. NYC's Commission on Human Rights' declaration against using "illegal alien" pejoratively.
2. Potential unconstitutionality under the First Amendment.
3. The law covers workplace harassment, tenants, public accommodations.
4. The guidance is broad, possibly infringing on free speech.
5. Even a single comment could be harassment, eliminating the'severe or pervasive' standard.
6. The author's concern about free speech and the need for limiting conditions.

Now, I'll structure the summary, ensuring each point is covered concisely and the moral words are used. I'll start with the declaration, mention the potential problem with the interpretation, the areas it covers, the broadness leading to possible constitutional issues, the elimination of the standard, and the concern about free speech.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me draft it:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. This interpretation may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it broadly prohibits speech meant to demean, humiliate, or harass. The guidance affects workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations but does not criminalize casual use. Critics argue the elimination of the'severe or pervasive' standard for harassment could infringe on free speech, as even a single comment could be considered illegal. The Commission's decrees to prohibit such statements may not satisfy First Amendment protections, raising concerns about overreach in anti-discrimination mandates.

Let me check the word count. It's around 120 words, so I can add more details if needed. I should ensure all key points are included and that the moral words are present. Maybe add that the guidance is problematic and how it affects the scope of anti-discrimination laws.

Finalizing the summary to include all necessary points and moral framing words.
