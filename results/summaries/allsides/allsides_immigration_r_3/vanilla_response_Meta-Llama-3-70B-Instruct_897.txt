SUMMARY:

The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person in a derogatory manner violates laws protecting employees and tenants from discrimination, and could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue that the city's interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it potentially restricts free speech. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer could be considered harassment, which may be too broad. Legal experts argue that anti-discrimination ordinances must come with limiting conditions to survive a First Amendment test, and that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements. The guidance may push the limits of free speech and could be challenged in court.

END OF SUMMARY.
