SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued guidance stating that using the term "illegal alien" with the intent to demean or harass an undocumented person is illegal and could result in fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, simply using the term in public or threatening to report someone to ICE is not illegal. The broad interpretation of the law has raised concerns about its constitutionality, as it may infringe on free speech rights. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all citizens. The severity or pervasiveness of harassment is only relevant to damages, and even a single comment by an employer could be considered illegal. This has led to criticism that the guidance pushes the boundaries of what is constitutionally permissible. Hans Bader, an attorney, has argued that even the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law may not sufficiently protect speech. The Commission's guidance highlights the complex balance between protecting individuals from harassment and upholding free speech rights.
END OF SUMMARY.
