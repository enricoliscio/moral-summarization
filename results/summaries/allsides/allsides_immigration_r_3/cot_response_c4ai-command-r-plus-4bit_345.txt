SUMMARY: 
New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" with pejorative intent towards an undocumented person is a violation of anti-discrimination laws. This interpretation, however, raises concerns about its constitutionality under the First Amendment. The commission's guidance notes that the use of the term, among others, to demean, humiliate, or harass an individual is illegal under the law. While this does not affect all speech, it covers workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation. The issue lies in the broad interpretation of what constitutes harassment, as even a single comment by an employer or landlord expressing discriminatory views on immigration status or national origin could be considered unlawful. This goes beyond the Supreme Court's requirement that conduct must be severe or pervasive to create a hostile environment and thus qualifies as harassment. Legal experts argue that such prohibitions on speech must be limited in scope to satisfy the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all people. The government cannot simply prohibit politically incorrect statements about undocumented people but must also balance anti-discrimination mandates with free speech rights.
