SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative manner to describe an undocumented person constitutes harassment and discrimination, violating laws that protect employees and tenants. The commission's guidance states that such language, intended to demean, humiliate, or harass, is illegal and can result in fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue that this interpretation may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it potentially prohibits free speech. The guidance notes that even a single comment by an employer can be considered harassment, which raises concerns about the scope of anti-discrimination mandates. Experts argue that government decrees must come with limiting conditions to survive a First Amendment test, and that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented people. The guidance's broad interpretation may signal a problem, and its elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law is alarming.
