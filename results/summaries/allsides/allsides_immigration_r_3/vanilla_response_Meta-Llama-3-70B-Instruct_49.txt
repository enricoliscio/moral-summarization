SUMMARY:

The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" in a derogatory manner to describe an undocumented person is a violation of laws protecting employees and tenants from discrimination, punishable by fines up to $250,000. However, critics argue that the city's interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it potentially limits free speech. The guidance notes that even a single comment by an employer can be considered harassment, regardless of severity or pervasiveness. This goes beyond federal law, which requires conduct to be severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with free speech guarantees, and some argue that NYC's approach is too broad.

END OF SUMMARY.
