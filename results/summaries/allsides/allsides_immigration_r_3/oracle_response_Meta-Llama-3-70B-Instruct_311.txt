SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" in a derogatory manner to describe an undocumented person violates laws protecting employees and tenants from discrimination, and could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, the city's broad interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment made with the intent to demean, humiliate, or harass a person based on their immigration status or national origin may be enough to constitute harassment. This raises a problem, as government decrees to prohibit free speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination must come with limiting conditions to survive a First Amendment test. The guidance's elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law is alarming, as it may prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented people without satisfying the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all people.

END OF SUMMARY.
