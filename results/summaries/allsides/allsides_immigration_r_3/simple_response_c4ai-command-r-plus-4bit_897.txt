SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person with the intent to demean, humiliate, or harass is illegal and could result in fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, it may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment as it prohibits free speech in the name of anti-harassment and anti-discrimination. The government must balance the protection of undocumented people with the free speech rights of individuals. The severity and pervasiveness of harassment are important factors in determining the legality of speech, but NYC's guidance may have eliminated this limit on liability, pushing it into unconstitutional territory. The Supreme Court requires that conduct must be severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment before it is legally considered harassment. The government must find a balance between protecting undocumented individuals and preserving free speech rights to ensure that anti-discrimination mandates do not infringe on the constitutional rights of its citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
