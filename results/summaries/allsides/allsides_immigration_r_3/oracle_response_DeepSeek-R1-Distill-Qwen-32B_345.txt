Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read the article carefully to understand the key points. The article discusses NYC's Commission on Human Rights ruling that using "illegal alien" pejoratively is illegal, potentially leading to fines. It mentions that this interpretation might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

I notice the author uses specific morally charged words like "interpretation," "demean," "humiliate," "harass," etc. I must include as many of these as possible in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll structure the summary by first stating the ruling, then the potential constitutional issue. I'll mention the protected categories and the specific guidance about the term. It's important to note that not all uses are illegal, only in specific contexts like workplaces. Then, I'll address the concern that NYC's approach might be too broad, citing the elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard and the implications for free speech. Finally, I'll conclude that the government must balance anti-discrimination with free speech rights.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering the ruling, its implications, the criticism, and the balance needed. I'll check word count to stay within limits and make sure all key moral terms are included.

SUMMARY:  
New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" pejoratively to demean, humiliate, or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. This interpretation, however, may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it broadly prohibits speech that signals discriminatory views about immigration status or national origin. The guidance specifies that even a single comment in the workplace could constitute harassment, eliminating the "severe or pervasive" standard typically required under federal law. Critics argue that this approach oversteps free speech protections, as the government cannot simply prohibit politically incorrect statements about undocumented people without limiting anti-discrimination mandates appropriately. The ruling applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not to casual use of the term on the street. The issue highlights the tension between anti-discrimination laws and First Amendment rights, emphasizing the need to balance protections against harassment with the freedom of speech. END OF SUMMARY.
