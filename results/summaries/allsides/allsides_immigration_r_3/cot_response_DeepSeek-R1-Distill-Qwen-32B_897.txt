Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided a news article about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" can be illegal under certain circumstances. They want a summary that keeps the moral words intact.

First, I should identify the morally framed words. Looking at the article, words like "illegal alien," "discrimination," "constitutional," "unconstitutional," "harassment," "protected," "free speech," "anti-discrimination," "harsh," "alarm," "prohibit," "politically incorrect," and "limit" stand out. These terms carry moral weight because they relate to rights, laws, and ethical issues.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include these words. The summary should be concise, no more than 200 words. I'll start by stating the Commission's action, then the potential constitutional issues, the scope of the law, and the concerns about free speech. I'll mention Bader's point about the severity standard and the broader implications of the law.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the declaration, moving to the criticism, and ending with the debate over free speech and discrimination. I'll keep each sentence focused and include the key moral terms to reflect the author's framing.

Finally, I'll check the word count to make sure it's under 200 words and that all the important points are covered without losing the moral perspective. This way, the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the intended moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
New York City's Commission on Human Rights ruled that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. Critics argue the ruling may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it restricts free speech by criminalizing certain statements. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations but does not penalize casual use of the term on the street. Legal experts, like Hans Bader, warn that the city's broad interpretation eliminates the federal requirement for harassment to be "severe or pervasive," potentially infringing on free speech rights. The government cannot simply prohibit "politically incorrect" statements; anti-discrimination laws must balance protection with free speech guarantees. END OF SUMMARY.
