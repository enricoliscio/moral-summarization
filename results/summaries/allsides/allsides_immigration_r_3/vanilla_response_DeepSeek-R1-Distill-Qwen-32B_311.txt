Alright, I need to summarize this article about New York City's Commission on Human Rights and their ruling on the term "illegal alien." Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by stating that the Commission declared using "illegal alien" pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines up to $250,000. They mention that this interpretation might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. 

Next, it explains that while immigration status is a protected category under NYC law, the guidance specifically targets harassment in workplaces, tenant rights, and public accommodations. It's important to note that using the term on the street isn't illegal, nor is threatening to call ICE.

The article then brings up the legal perspective, citing that anti-discrimination laws can sometimes limit free speech but NYC's approach is broader. The guidance says even a single comment can be harassment, which could be problematic because it might not meet the "severe or pervasive" standard required under federal law.

Hans Bader, an attorney, is quoted saying that NYC's elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard is alarming and could infringe on free speech. The government can't just prohibit politically incorrect statements; they need to balance anti-discrimination with First Amendment rights.

So, putting this together, the summary should cover the Commission's ruling, the potential unconstitutionality, the scope of the law, the legal standards, and the concern about free speech. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed.

I should start by stating the ruling, mention the potential First Amendment issue, explain the scope of the law, reference the legal standards, and conclude with the concern about free speech. That should cover all the essential elements succinctly.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" pejoratively to describe undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. The ruling, however, may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment due to its broad interpretation. The law protects against workplace harassment, tenant discrimination, and public accommodation issues but does not criminalize casual use of the term or threats to contact ICE. Critics argue that the guidance eliminates the "severe or pervasive" standard required under federal law, which could infringe on free speech rights. Attorney Hans Bader highlights that even the federal standard is too restrictive, making NYC's approach particularly concerning. The government must balance anti-discrimination efforts with First Amendment protections, as it cannot simply prohibit politically incorrect speech. END OF SUMMARY.
