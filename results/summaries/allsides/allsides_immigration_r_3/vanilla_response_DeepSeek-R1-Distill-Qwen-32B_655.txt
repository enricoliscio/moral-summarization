Okay, so I need to summarize this article about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" can be illegal. Hmm, let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

First, the Commission says using "illegal alien" pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, leading to fines up to $250,000. That's a big point. They mention that this interpretation might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it's too broad. I should note that the law protects against workplace harassment, tenant rights, and public accommodations, not all speech.

The article also talks about how the guidance from the Commission is detailed, 30 pages, and it says even a single comment could be harassment. That's a problem because it might go against the First Amendment. There's a reference to the Supreme Court requiring harassment to be severe or pervasive, but NYC's law doesn't have that limit, which could be an issue.

An attorney, Hans Bader, is quoted saying that even the federal standard isn't enough for free speech, and NYC is making it worse by eliminating that standard. So, the government can't just ban politically incorrect statements without limits.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the Commission's ruling, the potential constitutional issue, the scope of the law, the problem with the single comment aspect, and the concern about free speech. I should keep it concise and make sure all key points are included without going into too much detail.

Let me check the word count as I go. I'll make sure each sentence covers one main point. Maybe start with the ruling, then the possible unconstitutionality, the scope, the issue with the standard, and Bader's concern. That should cover all the essential parts.

Wait, the user mentioned that the summary should be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." Also, it should be no longer than 200 words. I need to ensure it's within that limit. I'll draft it and then count the words to make sure.

I think I have all the key points. Let me put it together now.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. This interpretation is controversial, as it may infringe on First Amendment rights by being overly broad. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenant rights, and public accommodations but does not regulate all speech, such as casual use on the street. The Commission's guidance states that even a single comment signaling discriminatory views could constitute harassment, eliminating the federal standard requiring harassment to be severe or pervasive. Critics argue this could restrict free speech, as the government cannot simply prohibit politically incorrect statements without clear limits. END OF SUMMARY.
