SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued guidance stating that using the term "illegal alien" with the intent to demean or harass an individual is illegal under the city's Human Rights Law. While the law covers workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation, it does not prohibit all uses of the term. The courts have generally upheld anti-discrimination ordinances, but the commission's broad interpretation may push it into unconstitutional territory. The guidance notes that even a single comment by an employer that signals discriminatory views about immigration status may be enough to constitute harassment, which could result in fines of up to $250,000. This has raised concerns about the limitations on free speech, as government decrees prohibiting speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination must meet certain conditions to pass a First Amendment test. Attorneys and civil rights officials argue that the city's guidance may not sufficiently protect speech and could potentially violate free speech rights.
