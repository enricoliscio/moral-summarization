Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. The article is about NYC's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" can be illegal under their anti-discrimination laws. They might face fines up to $250,000. The article argues that this might be unconstitutional because it's too broad and infringes on free speech.

First, I should identify the main points. The commission says using "illegal alien" pejoratively is illegal in certain contexts like workplaces and housing. They're expanding the law, which has been a protected category before. But critics, like Hans Bader, say this goes too far because it doesn't require the harassment to be severe or pervasive, which is a standard in federal law. The article is concerned that this might violate the First Amendment because it's limiting speech too much.

I need to make sure the summary includes that the law applies to specific contexts, not all speech. Also, the potential unconstitutionality because it's too broad. The moral framing here is about balancing anti-discrimination with free speech rights. So, the summary should highlight that the commission's guidance is broad and might not meet constitutional standards, thus affecting free speech.

I should structure the summary to first state what the commission did, then mention the potential issues with constitutionality, and the concern over free speech. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to include that it's about workplace and tenant rights, not all public speech. Also, note the criticism about removing the severity requirement, making it too strict.

Let me try to draft it: 

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative manner violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. However, this broad interpretation may infringe on First Amendment rights. The law applies to workplaces, housing, and public accommodations, but not all public speech. Critics argue that the lack of a severity requirement makes it unconstitutional, as it restricts more speech than allowed.

Wait, that's too short. I need to include more details about the contexts where it applies and the criticism from Bader. Also, mention that the law doesn't affect all speech, only specific areas.

Let me try again, making sure to cover all points without being too verbose. 

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass individuals is illegal under anti-discrimination laws, potentially resulting in fines up to $250,000. This applies to workplaces, housing, and public accommodations. However, critics argue that the law's broad interpretation may infringe on First Amendment rights, as it doesn't require harassment to be severe or pervasive, unlike federal standards. This could push the law into unconstitutional territory by overly restricting free speech.

That's better. It includes the main points: the commission's action, the contexts it applies to, the criticism regarding constitutional issues, and the impact on free speech. I think this captures the moral framing about the balance between discrimination protections and free speech.
