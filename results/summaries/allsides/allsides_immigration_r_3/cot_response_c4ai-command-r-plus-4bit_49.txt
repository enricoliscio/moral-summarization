SUMMARY:
The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" with pejorative intent to describe an undocumented individual is a violation of laws meant to protect against discrimination in the workplace, housing, and public accommodations. This decision is based on the existing protection of perceived immigration status under the New York City Human Rights Law. However, the broad interpretation of this law raises concerns about its potential unconstitutionality under the First Amendment. While the law does not restrict all speech, it does cover areas such as workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation. The guidance issued by the commission states that even a single comment by an employer that indicates discriminatory views on immigration status or national origin may constitute harassment. This has sparked debate as it may infringe on free speech rights, with some arguing that the government cannot prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements and that anti-discrimination mandates must be limited in scope to respect the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all.
