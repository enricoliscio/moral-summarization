SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued guidance stating that using the term "illegal alien" with the intent to demean or harass an undocumented person is illegal and could result in fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, it raises questions about free speech and the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer that signals discriminatory views about one's immigration status may be enough to constitute harassment, which some attorneys argue pushes the guidance into unconstitutional territory. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all citizens.

END OF SUMMARY.
