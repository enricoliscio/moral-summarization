Okay, so the user has provided a news article about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" can be illegal under certain circumstances. They want a summary that preserves the moral framing the author used. The user has listed specific morally framed words that should be included.

First, I need to read the article carefully to understand the main points. The Commission's guidance is about workplace harassment and tenants' rights, not just any speech. They mention that using "illegal alien" with intent to demean, humiliate, or harass is illegal, which could lead to fines. But the author argues this might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment because it's too broad.

I should identify the key morally charged words from the article: interpretation, used, demean, humiliate, harass, harassment, going, signal, problem, guidance, decrees, prohibit, come, make, eliminated, statements, satisfy. I need to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

I'll start by stating the Commission's action, then the potential constitutional issue. I'll mention the protected categories and the specific terms they're targeting. It's important to note that the law applies to specific contexts, not all speech. Then, I'll address the concern about the guidance possibly being unconstitutional because it lacks the necessary limits on speech. The author's point about the government not being able to prohibit politically incorrect statements without proper constraints is crucial.

I should structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the Commission's guidance, then the implications, and finally the constitutional concerns. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and includes the morally framed words as much as possible.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the Commission's declaration, mention the term "illegal alien" and the intent to demean. Then, note that it's not all speech but specific contexts. Highlight the potential constitutional issue with the broad interpretation. Include the part about the guidance eliminating the'severe or pervasive' standard, which is a problem. Finally, conclude with the balance between anti-discrimination and free speech.

I think that covers all the key points and includes the necessary moral terms. I'll make sure each sentence flows into the next and that the summary is within the word limit.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to demean, humiliate, or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. The guidance targets workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but critics argue it may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment due to its broad interpretation. The law does not criminalize all uses of the term, such as casual speech, but focuses on contexts where it signals discriminatory intent. The problem arises when the guidance eliminates the requirement for harassment to be severe or pervasive, a standard necessary to protect free speech. As Hans Bader notes, the government cannot simply prohibit politically incorrect statements without ensuring anti-discrimination mandates satisfy First Amendment protections. The city's decrees to prohibit such speech risk overstepping constitutional limits, making it a significant issue in balancing anti-discrimination efforts with free speech rights. END OF SUMMARY.
