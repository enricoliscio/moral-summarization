SUMMARY:

The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person in a derogatory manner violates laws protecting employees and tenants from discrimination, and could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue that the city's interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it potentially restricts free speech. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer could be considered harassment, which may not meet the Supreme Court's standard of "severe or pervasive" conduct. The city's law covers workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation, but some argue that it goes too far in limiting speech. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with free speech guarantees, and the NYC guidance may not meet this standard.

END OF SUMMARY.
