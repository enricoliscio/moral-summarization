SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to demean, humiliate, or harass undocumented individuals is illegal and can result in fines of up to $250,000. While perceived immigration status is a protected category under the New York City Human Rights Law, the commission's guidance may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer can be considered harassment, which raises concerns about the limits of free speech. Critics argue that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals and must limit the scope of anti-discrimination mandates to satisfy broad free speech guarantees. The commission's interpretation of the law may be going too far, creating a problem that could push the guidance into unconstitutional territory. The government's decrees to prohibit free speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination must come with certain limiting conditions to survive a First Amendment test.

END OF SUMMARY.
