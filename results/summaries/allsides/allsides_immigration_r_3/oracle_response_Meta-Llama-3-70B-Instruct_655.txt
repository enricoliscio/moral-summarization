SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to demean, humiliate, or harass undocumented individuals is illegal and can result in fines of up to $250,000. While the guidance aims to protect employees and tenants from discrimination, its broad interpretation may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The commission's 30-page guidance notes that even a single comment made with intent to harass can constitute harassment, which may push the guidance into unconstitutional territory. This raises a problem, as government decrees to prohibit free speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination must come with limiting conditions to survive a First Amendment test. The guidance's elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law is alarming, as it may prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals without satisfying the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all people.
