SUMMARY: Last week, New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued a problematic interpretation of the law regarding the use of the term "illegal alien." The commission declared that using the term pejorively to describe an undocumented person is illegal and could result in hefty fines. While perceived immigration status is a protected category under the New York City Human Rights Law, the commission's guidance goes too far in attempting to prohibit free speech. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer could be enough to constitute harassment, which is an alarming elimination of the modest limits on liability. The government must be careful not to simply used its power to prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals. The scope of anti-discrimination mandates must be limited to satisfy the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all. The commission's guidance may very well be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it attempts to restrict speech beyond what is necessary to prevent harassment or discrimination. This overreach could set a dangerous precedent and push the boundaries of free speech in an unacceptable direction.
END OF SUMMARY.
