Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about New York City's Commission on Human Rights and their stance on the term "illegal alien." Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that NYC's Commission on Human Rights declared using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative way violates anti-discrimination laws, which could lead to fines up to $250,000. That's a significant point because it's about workplace and tenant protections. But then it mentions that this interpretation might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. That's an important legal angle.

The article explains that while perceived immigration status is protected under NYC's Human Rights Law, the new guidance specifically targets the use of "illegal alien" with intent to demean or harass. It's crucial to note that this doesn't apply to all speechâ€”only in contexts like workplace harassment, tenant rights, and public accommodations. So, just calling someone that on the street isn't illegal, nor is threatening to call ICE. That's a key distinction.

The article then brings up the legal precedent where anti-discrimination laws have been upheld despite seeming to limit free speech. However, NYC's approach is more extensive. The 30-page guidance states that even a single comment can constitute harassment if it signals discriminatory views. This is problematic because it might infringe on free speech rights.

Hans Bader, an attorney, points out that federal law requires harassment to be severe or pervasive to be illegal, but NYC has removed that standard. He's concerned this makes the law too broad and possibly unconstitutional. The article ends by emphasizing that the government can't just ban politically incorrect speech without proper limitations to comply with free speech protections.

So, for the summary, I need to capture the main points: the Commission's declaration, the potential constitutional issue, the contexts where the law applies, the concern over free speech, and the implications of removing the severity standard.

I should structure it to first state the Commission's action, then the criticism about constitutionality, the specific contexts of the law, the concern from Bader, and the broader implication about free speech. Keeping it under 200 words and making sure it's concise.

I'll start with the declaration, mention the possible unconstitutionality, explain the contexts where the law applies, note the concern about free speech, and end with the implication of the law's broadness. That should cover all the essential points succinctly.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue this broad interpretation may infringe on First Amendment rights, as it could criminalize protected speech. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenant rights, and public accommodations, but not to casual use of the term or threats to contact ICE. Legal experts, including Hans Bader, warn that NYC's guidance eliminates the federal requirement for harassment to be severe or pervasive, making it overly broad and potentially unconstitutional. The government must balance anti-discrimination efforts with free speech protections to avoid overreach. END OF SUMMARY.
