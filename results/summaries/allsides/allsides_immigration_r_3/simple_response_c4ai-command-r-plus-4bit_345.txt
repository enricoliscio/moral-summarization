SUMMARY: Last week, New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued a broad interpretation of the law, stating that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented individual with the intent to demean, humiliate, or harass is illegal and could result in hefty fines. While the law covers workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation, the commission's guidance pushes the boundaries of free speech into potentially unconstitutional territory. The guidance suggests that even a single comment made by an employer that signals discriminatory views about immigration status or national origin could be enough to constitute harassment, which is problematic. Attorney Hans Bader argues that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements and must respect the free speech rights guaranteed to all. The challenge is in balancing the protection of individuals from harassment and discrimination while also upholding the right to free speech, which is a delicate and complex task.

END OF SUMMARY.
