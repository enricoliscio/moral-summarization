Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article is about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative way violates anti-discrimination laws. They can fine up to $250,000. But the problem is that this might be unconstitutional because it infringes on the First Amendment. The law protects against workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not all uses of the term are illegal. The issue is that the city's guidance is too broad, potentially going beyond what's allowed under the Constitution.

I should highlight the moral aspects. The city is trying to protect people from discrimination, which is a positive moral stance. However, the criticism is that this oversteps into restricting free speech, which is a negative moral implication. So the summary needs to balance both sides: the protection against discrimination versus the potential violation of free speech rights.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear. I'll mention the law, the potential unconstitutionality, and the opposing viewpoints on discrimination vs. free speech.

Let me structure it: Start with the law, then the criticism about constitutionality, mention the areas it applies to, the potential overreach, and conclude with the debate between discrimination protection and free speech. Make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. Critics argue that the city's broad interpretation may infringe on First Amendment rights, as it could criminalize speech protected under the Constitution. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not to casual use of the term or threatening to contact ICE. Legal experts, like Hans Bader, warn that the city's guidance eliminates the federal requirement for harassment to be "severe or pervasive," potentially expanding liability too broadly. The move raises concerns that the government is overstepping by prohibiting politically incorrect speech, rather than balancing anti-discrimination efforts with free speech protections. END OF SUMMARY.
