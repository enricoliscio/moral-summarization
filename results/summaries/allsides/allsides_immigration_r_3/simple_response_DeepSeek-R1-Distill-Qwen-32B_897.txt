Alright, I need to summarize this news article while keeping the moral framing intact. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative way is illegal under their anti-discrimination laws. They could fine up to $250,000. The author argues that this might be unconstitutional because it infringes on the First Amendment.

I should highlight the key points: the law's application to workplace harassment and tenant rights, but not all speech. The concern is that the law is too broad, potentially violating free speech. The author cites a legal expert, Hans Bader, who points out that federal law requires harassment to be severe or pervasive, which NYC has removed, making it too restrictive.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the moral argument about free speech and potential unconstitutionality. I'll structure it to first state the law, then the criticism, and conclude with the constitutional concern.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's within limits. I'll make sure to include all necessary elements without going over.

SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines of up to $250,000. Critics argue that the law's broad interpretation may infringe on First Amendment rights, as it criminalizes certain speech without requiring proof of severity or pervasiveness, as federal law does. The guidance targets workplace harassment, tenant rights, and public accommodations but does not apply to casual street comments or threats to report someone to ICE. Legal专家 Hans Bader warns that eliminating the "severe or pervasive" standard could push the law into unconstitutional territory, as it overextends anti-discrimination mandates and restricts free speech. The issue highlights the tension between protecting vulnerable groups and safeguarding constitutional rights. END OF SUMMARY.
