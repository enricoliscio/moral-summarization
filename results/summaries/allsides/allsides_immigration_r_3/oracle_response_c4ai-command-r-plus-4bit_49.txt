SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued a broad interpretation of the law regarding the use of the term "illegal alien," declaring that using the term pejoratively to describe an undocumented person is illegal and could result in hefty fines. This guidance is meant to protect employees and tenants from discrimination and harassment. However, the city's interpretation raises concerns about the free speech rights of individuals. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer that signals discriminatory views about one's immigration status may be enough to constitute harassment, which is a problematic statement that might push the guidance into unconstitutional territory. The government must be careful not to simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements, but rather, it should focus on limiting the scope of anti-discrimination mandates to satisfy the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all. The severity and pervasiveness of harassment are important factors in determining the legality of such statements, and NYC's guidance may have eliminated these necessary limitations, causing potential issues with the First Amendment.
END OF SUMMARY.
