SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued guidance stating that using the term "illegal alien" with the intent to demean, humiliate, or harass an undocumented person is illegal and could result in significant fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, simply using the term in public or threatening to report someone to immigration authorities is not illegal. The issue arises as the government's attempt to prohibit discriminatory speech must be balanced against free speech guarantees. The commission's guidance may be unconstitutional as it does not include limiting conditions, such as the severity or pervasiveness of the harassment, which are necessary to survive a First Amendment test. The government must strike a balance between prohibiting discriminatory statements and protecting free speech rights, a challenging but necessary task. The interpretation and enforcement of anti-discrimination laws must carefully navigate these complex moral and legal considerations.
END OF SUMMARY.
