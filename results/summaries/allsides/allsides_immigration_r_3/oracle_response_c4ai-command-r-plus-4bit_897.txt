SUMMARY: Last week, the New York City Commission on Human Rights issued a problematic interpretation of the law regarding the use of the term "illegal alien." The Commission declared that using the term pejorively to describe an undocumented person is illegal and could result in hefty fines. While perceived immigration status is a protected category under the New York City Human Rights Law, the commission's guidance goes too far in restricting free speech. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer to signal discriminatory views about one's immigration status may be enough to constitute harassment. This eliminates the modest limits on liability and pushes the guidance into potentially unconstitutional territory. The government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals. The scope of anti-discrimination mandates must be limited to satisfy the broad free speech guarantees that all people are entitled to. The First Amendment protects the right to free speech, and government decrees that prohibit certain speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination must come with limiting conditions to pass constitutional muster.
END OF SUMMARY.
