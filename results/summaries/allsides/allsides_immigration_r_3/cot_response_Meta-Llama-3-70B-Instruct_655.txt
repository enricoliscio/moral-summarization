SUMMARY:
The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person in a pejorative manner violates laws protecting employees and tenants from discrimination. The commission's guidance notes that such language, intended to demean, humiliate, or harass, is illegal and could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue that the city's interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it eliminates the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law. This raises concerns about the government's ability to prohibit free speech in the name of anti-harassment or anti-discrimination. The guidance may be seen as alarming, as it potentially limits the free speech guarantees enjoyed by all people, and could be viewed as an overreach in the name of protecting undocumented individuals from discriminatory views.
