SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person is discriminatory and could result in fines. While the law covers workplace harassment and tenants' rights, it may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment as it prohibits free speech in the name of anti-discrimination. The government must balance the protection of undocumented individuals with the free speech rights of citizens, and the current guidance may be too broad and restrictive. The courts have upheld anti-discrimination ordinances in the past, but NYC's guidance pushes the boundaries by stating that even a single comment about someone's immigration status could be enough to constitute harassment. This ignores the "severe or pervasive" standard required by federal law and sets a dangerous precedent for limiting free speech. The government must find a way to protect undocumented people without infringing on the free speech rights of its citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
