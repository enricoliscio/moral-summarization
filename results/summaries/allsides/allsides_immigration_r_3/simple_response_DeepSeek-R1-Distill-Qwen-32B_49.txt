Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about New York City's Commission on Human Rights declaring that using the term "illegal alien" in a pejorative way violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines up to $250,000. The author is critical of this decision, arguing that it might be unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

First, I should identify the main points:

1. NYC's Commission on Human Rights says using "illegal alien" pejoratively is illegal.
2. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations.
3. Not all uses are illegal, like calling someone that on the street or threatening ICE.
4. The guidance is broader than federal standards, eliminating the "severe or pervasive" requirement.
5. Critics, like Hans Bader, argue this infringes on free speech and might be unconstitutional.

Now, I need to capture these points in a concise summary, keeping the moral framing. The author is concerned about free speech and the potential overreach of the law. I should mention the criticism regarding the First Amendment and the elimination of the "severe or pervasive" standard.

I should structure the summary to first state the Commission's action, then the scope, exceptions, the criticism, and the potential constitutional issue. Keeping it under 200 words.

Let me draft it:

"New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term 'illegal alien' pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations. However, critics argue the guidance is overly broad and may infringe on First Amendment rights. Unlike federal standards requiring harassment to be severe or pervasive, NYC's law considers even a single offensive comment as harassment. Legal experts, such as Hans Bader, warn this could be unconstitutional, as it restricts free speech without sufficient limits. The decision faces criticism for potentially criminalizing politically incorrect speech without adequate safeguards."

Wait, that's over 200 words. Let me check the word count. Hmm, it's around 120 words. Maybe I can make it more concise.

"New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term 'illegal alien' pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations. Critics argue the guidance is overly broad and may infringe on First Amendment rights. Unlike federal standards requiring harassment to be severe or pervasive, NYC's law considers even a single offensive comment as harassment. Legal experts warn this could be unconstitutional, as it restricts free speech without sufficient limits."

That's about 90 words. Maybe I can add a bit more detail about the exceptions without exceeding the limit.

"New York City's Commission on Human Rights has ruled that using the term 'illegal alien' pejoratively violates anti-discrimination laws, potentially leading to fines. The law applies to workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodations, but not to casual use on the street or threatening ICE. Critics argue the guidance is overly broad and may infringe on First Amendment rights. Unlike federal standards requiring harassment to be severe or pervasive, NYC's law considers even a single offensive comment as harassment. Legal experts warn this could be unconstitutional, as it restricts free speech without sufficient limits."

That's about 100 words. It covers the main points, the exceptions, and the criticism regarding free speech and constitutionality. I think this captures the moral framing of the article, emphasizing the potential overreach and threat to free speech.
