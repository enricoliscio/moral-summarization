SUMMARY:

New York City's Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to demean or harass undocumented individuals is illegal and can result in fines of up to $250,000. While the city's law aims to protect employees and tenants from discrimination, its broad interpretation may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment by an employer can be considered harassment, which may push the limits of free speech. Critics argue that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals, and that anti-discrimination mandates must be limited to satisfy free speech guarantees. The city's interpretation may be too broad and could be struck down in court.

END OF SUMMARY.
