SUMMARY:
The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" pejoratively to describe an undocumented person violates laws designed to protect employees and tenants from discrimination. The commission's guidance notes that such language, when used with intent to demean, humiliate, or harass a person, is illegal under the law. However, critics argue that the city's interpretation of the law is too broad and may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance eliminates the "severe or pervasive" standard, making it alarming that the government is prohibiting people from making certain statements about undocumented individuals. The commission's move raises concerns about the limits of free speech and the balance between anti-discrimination mandates and the protection of speech.
