SUMMARY:
The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" pejoratively to describe an undocumented person is a violation of laws designed to protect employees and tenants from discrimination. The commission's guidance states that such language, when used with intent to demean, humiliate, or harass, is illegal and could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, critics argue that the city's interpretation of the law is too broad and may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance eliminates the "severe or pervasive" standard found in federal law, which is alarming and raises concerns about the limits of free speech. The government must balance anti-discrimination mandates with the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all people, and cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals.
