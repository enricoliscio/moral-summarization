SUMMARY:

The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person in a derogatory manner violates laws protecting employees and tenants from discrimination, and could result in fines of up to $250,000. However, the city's interpretation of the law may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance issued by the commission notes that even a single comment made by an employer could be considered harassment, which may be too broad. Critics argue that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented people, and must limit the scope of anti-discrimination mandates to satisfy free speech guarantees. The Supreme Court requires that conduct be severe or pervasive enough to make the work environment hostile before it is legally considered harassment, a standard that New York City has eliminated.

END OF SUMMARY.
