SUMMARY:

The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person can be considered harassment and discrimination, punishable by fines up to $250,000. While the law aims to protect employees and tenants from discrimination, critics argue that it may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as it potentially limits free speech. The guidance notes that even a single comment made by an employer can be considered harassment, which may be too broad. Experts argue that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements, but must limit the scope of anti-discrimination mandates to satisfy free speech guarantees. The law's broad interpretation raises concerns about its constitutionality and potential chilling effect on speech.
