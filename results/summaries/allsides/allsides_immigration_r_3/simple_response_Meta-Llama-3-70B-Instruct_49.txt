SUMMARY:

The New York City Commission on Human Rights has declared that using the term "illegal alien" to describe an undocumented person in a derogatory manner violates human rights laws and can result in fines of up to $250,000. While the law aims to protect employees and tenants from discrimination, its broad interpretation may be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The guidance notes that even a single comment by an employer can be considered harassment, which may push the limits of free speech. Critics argue that the government cannot simply prohibit people from making politically incorrect statements about undocumented individuals, and that anti-discrimination mandates must be limited to satisfy broad free speech guarantees.

The moral framing of this article emphasizes the importance of balancing the protection of human rights with the preservation of free speech. While discrimination and harassment are morally reprehensible, the government must ensure that its laws do not overstep and infringe upon individuals' right to express themselves freely.
