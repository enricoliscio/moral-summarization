SUMMARY: New York City's Commission on Human Rights has issued a problematic interpretation of the law regarding the use of the term "illegal alien," stating that using it with the intent to demean, humiliate, or harass an undocumented person is illegal and could result in hefty fines. While the law covers workplace harassment, tenants' rights, and public accommodation, the commission's guidance goes too far in limiting free speech. Even a single comment made by an employer that signals discriminatory views about immigration status or national origin could be considered illegal harassment, according to the guidance. This broad interpretation may push the guidance into unconstitutional territory, as it eliminates the modest limits on liability that are necessary to protect free speech rights. The government must find a balance between prohibiting harassment and discrimination and preserving the broad free speech guarantees enjoyed by all citizens. This guidance fails to satisfy that balance and instead, eliminates important protections for free speech.
END OF SUMMARY.
