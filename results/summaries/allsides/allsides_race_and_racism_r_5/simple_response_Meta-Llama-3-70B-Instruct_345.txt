SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite recent tragic events, emphasizing that "we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." He acknowledged the pain and frustration caused by the fatal shootings of black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. However, he insisted that race relations have not regressed to the 1960s and that the country has made progress. Obama announced the revival of a task force to address community-police relations and reiterated his commitment to stopping gun violence. He also sympathized with police officers who have to make difficult decisions in gun-filled communities. The president emphasized that violent crime has decreased over the past 15 years and that the country must work together to build on the progress made.
