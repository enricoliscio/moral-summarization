SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations amidst the fatal shootings of two black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He emphasized that "we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." Despite the recent wave of protests and violence, Obama insisted that race relations have not regressed to the 1960s. He revived the task force formed after the Ferguson shooting, which will include police officers, community and civil rights activists to discuss next steps. Obama argued that violent crime has decreased over the past 15 years and committed to stopping gun violence, making it "harder" for people to carry out their anger with weapons. He sympathized with police officers in gun-filled communities who have "very little margin of error" when engaging with people on the street. Obama also tried to calm public anxiety about personal safety, saying violent crime is actually down in the U.S.
