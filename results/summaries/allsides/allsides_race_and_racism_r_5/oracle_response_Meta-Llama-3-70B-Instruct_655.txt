SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite the recent fatal shootings of two black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He emphasized that "we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." The president insisted that race relations in the US have not regressed to the point of 1960's rioting, citing a decrease in violent crime over the past 15 years. He revived a task force to address police-community relations and committed to stopping gun violence, making it "harder" for people to carry out their anger with weapons. Obama sympathized with police officers in gun-filled communities, citing the "loss of life" and the need to prioritize their safety. He also acknowledged the threat of non-state actors like the Islamic State group, emphasizing the need to confront and eliminate them. The president sought to calm public anxiety about personal safety, stressing that violent crime is actually down in the US.
