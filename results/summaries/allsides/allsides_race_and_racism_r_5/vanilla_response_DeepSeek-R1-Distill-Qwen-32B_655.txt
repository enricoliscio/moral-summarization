Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's comments on race relations and other topics. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts with Obama urging optimism about race relations after some tragic events: two black men were shot by police, and then a gunman killed five Dallas officers. He mentions that these actions shouldn't define all of us. He also says that race relations haven't regressed to the 1960s level, which some people argue. He's speaking in Poland at a NATO summit.

He revived a task force created after the Ferguson incident, which includes police, community activists, etc., to discuss next steps. He points out that despite the tragic week, there's a foundation to build on, and violent crime has decreased over the past years.

He also talks about gun violence, saying he'll keep pushing for measures to prevent people from using weapons in acts of anger. He compares the Dallas shooter, Micah Johnson, to the Orlando shooter, calling them demented individuals who don't represent everyone. He avoids naming them.

Obama mentions that even some protesters in Dallas were armed, and he ties this to laws allowing gun carrying. He also refers to the Philando Castile case where the shooter had a legally owned gun. He tries to calm fears about safety by noting that violent crime is down.

He reflects on military operations, saying the U.S. isn't in active combat anymore but is training others. He mentions the Islamic State as an ongoing threat. Regarding Brexit, he says the U.K. and EU should handle it sensibly and that the U.S. will remain a friend and partner.

He also touches on globalization, acknowledging its downsides but saying it's here to stay.

So, the summary needs to cover these points concisely: Obama's optimism, the task force, gun control, comparison to Orlando shooter, the need for sensible Brexit handling, military operations, and his views on globalization.

I need to make sure it's under 200 words and flows well. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each main point is included without going into too much detail.
