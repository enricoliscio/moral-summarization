Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They provided the article and a list of morally charged words. I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is addressing race relations after some tragic events involving shootings and protests. He's emphasizing hope and progress despite the violence. 

I should identify the key events: two black men shot by police, then a gunman killing five officers in Dallas. The moral words here are "shot," "killing," "dead," "protests." 

Obama mentions the task force formed after Michael Brown's death, so I should include that. He talks about the decrease in violent crime, which ties into "crime" and "violence." 

He also addresses gun control, linking it to safety and preventing future attacks. Words like "stop," "violence," "safety" are important. 

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points: Obama's message of hope, the events, the task force, crime statistics, gun control, and his stance on terrorism. 

I'll structure it to include all the morally framed words without making it too long. Make sure each sentence touches on one of the key points and uses the appropriate terms.

SUMMARY: President Obama addressed the nation after recent tragic events, including the fatal shootings of two black males by police and a gunman killing five Dallas officers, urging Americans to remain hopeful about race relations. He emphasized that these actions do not define the entire country, rejecting claims that relations have regressed to 1960s levels of rioting. Obama revived a task force, including police, activists, and others, to address the issue. He acknowledged the loss of life but highlighted progress in reducing violent crime over the past decades. Obama also stressed the need to stop gun violence, noting that even peaceful protesters in Texas were armed. He described the Dallas sniper as a "demented individual" and called for unity, stating that such acts do not represent the nation. Obama also discussed the challenges faced by police in gun-filled communities and the importance of addressing gun availability. He reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to combating terrorism and maintaining global partnerships, while cautioning about the risks of globalization. END OF SUMMARY.
