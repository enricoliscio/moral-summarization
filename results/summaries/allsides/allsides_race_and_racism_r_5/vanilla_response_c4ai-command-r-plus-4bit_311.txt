SUMMARY: In a wide-ranging press conference, President Obama addressed recent events in Dallas, where five law enforcement officials were killed by a gunman, and the fatal shootings of two black males by police officers. Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations and insisted that the situation has not reached a new low. He also highlighted his commitment to stopping gun violence and announced the revival of a task force formed after the Ferguson shooting to discuss next steps. Obama compared the Dallas sniper to the Orlando nightclub shooter, calling them both "demented individuals" who do not represent the American people. He declined to label the Dallas attack a hate crime but emphasized the difficulty of interpreting the shooter's motives. The president acknowledged the challenges faced by police officers in gun-filled communities and called for addressing the gun issue to ensure their safety. Obama also reflected on his two terms as president, the war on terror, and the UK's exit from the EU. He emphasized the importance of a sensible and orderly exit process and the enduring friendship between the US, the UK, and the EU.
