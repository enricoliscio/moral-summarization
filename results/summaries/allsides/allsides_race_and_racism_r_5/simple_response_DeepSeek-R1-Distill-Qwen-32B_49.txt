Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about President Obama's comments on race relations and other topics. They mentioned that I need to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, so I should focus on the key moral points he made, like unity, not letting a few define all, and the need for progress despite challenges.

First, I'll read through the article to identify the main points. Obama talks about the recent shootings and the need for optimism. He mentions the task force and the decrease in violent crime. Also, he addresses gun violence and the complexities faced by police officers.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral aspects. I should include his stance against letting a few incidents define the whole, the revival of the task force, his comments on gun laws, and the mention of the sniper's motives without naming them.

I also need to structure it in a way that flows logically, starting with the shootings, his call for optimism, the task force, then moving on to gun violence and the challenges faced by police. Finally, touch on his broader comments about the country's progress and the importance of addressing gun issues.

Wait, the user also mentioned that the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." So I need to format it that way. I should ensure that each sentence in the summary is clear and captures the essence without getting too detailed.

Let me piece it together: Start with the shootings and his call for unity. Then mention the task force and the decrease in crime. Next, his stance on gun laws and the complexities for police. Finally, his broader comments on the country's progress and the need to tackle gun violence.

I should also check the word count to make sure it's within the limit. Let me draft it and then count the words to adjust if needed.

SUMMARY: President Obama addressed the nation's racial tensions following the fatal shootings of two black men by police and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas officers. He urged optimism, stating, "We cannot let the actions of a few define all of us," and dismissed claims that race relations have regressed to the 1960s. Obama revived a task force to address police-community relations, emphasizing progress despite recent tragedies. He acknowledged the challenges faced by police in gun-filled communities and linked gun violence to racial tensions, calling for stricter gun laws. Obama also discussed the complexities of interpreting the motives of the Dallas sniper, Micah Johnson, and the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, emphasizing that such individuals do not represent the broader population. He highlighted the importance of addressing gun violence and the need for unity in combating racial tension. Obama also touched on U.S. military operations, Brexit, and globalization, reaffirming the country's commitment to international partnerships. END OF SUMMARY.
