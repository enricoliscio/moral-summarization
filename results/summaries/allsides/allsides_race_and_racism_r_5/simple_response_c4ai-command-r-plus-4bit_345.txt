SUMMARY: Speaking in Warsaw, Poland, at the end of his final NATO summit, President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations in the wake of recent tragic events, including the fatal shootings of two black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law enforcement officers by a black Army veteran. The President insisted that race relations have not reached a new low and highlighted the decrease in violent crime over the past decade. He also renewed his commitment to addressing gun violence and stopping hate crimes. Obama drew a parallel between the Dallas sniper and the Orlando nightclub shooter, calling them "demented individuals" who do not represent the American people. He emphasized the difficulty faced by police officers in communities with widespread gun ownership and called for a sensible and orderly approach to addressing gun violence. The President concluded by acknowledging the ongoing challenge of confronting non-state actors like the Islamic State group and affirmed America's commitment to its allies, stating that "in good times and in bad, Europe can count on the United Statesâ€”always."
