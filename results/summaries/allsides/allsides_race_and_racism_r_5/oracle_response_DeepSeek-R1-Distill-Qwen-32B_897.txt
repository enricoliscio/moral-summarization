SUMMARY: President Obama addressed the nation during a period of racial tension, following the fatal shootings of black males by police and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas officers. He urged optimism, stating that the actions of a few should not define the country. Obama dismissed claims that race relations have regressed to the 1960s, emphasizing progress and the foundation for improvement. He revived a task force to address police-community relations, involving activists, officers, and others. Despite the tragic losses, Obama highlighted the reduction in violent crime over the past decades. He also stressed the importance of addressing gun violence, noting that even peaceful protesters in Texas were armed. Obama condemned the Dallas sniper, Micah Johnson, and the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, as "demented individuals" not representative of the nation. He acknowledged the challenges faced by police in communities with widespread gun ownership and called for a focus on gun control. Obama also discussed the complexities of military operations against non-state actors like ISIS and the impact of Brexit on global stability. He emphasized the enduring partnership between the U.S. and Europe while cautioning about the risks of globalization. END OF SUMMARY.
