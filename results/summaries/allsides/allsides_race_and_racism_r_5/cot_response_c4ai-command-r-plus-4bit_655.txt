SUMMARY: President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations in the aftermath of two black males being fatally shot by police officers and a gunman apparently retaliating by killing five law enforcement officials in Dallas. Obama insisted that race relations have not regressed to the point of 1960s rioting and renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence. He called the Dallas sniper "a demented individual" and justly motivated by hate, and spoke sympathetically of the difficult job police officers have in gun-filled communities. Obama also tried to calm public anxiety about personal safety, acknowledging that violent crime is down and that confronting non-state actors like ISIS will be an ongoing challenge. The President emphasized the importance of sensible gun laws, caring about the safety of police officers, and the damaging effects of hardening positions on issues like globalization, which can lead to increased inequality and leverage issues.
