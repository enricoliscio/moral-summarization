SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite the recent fatal shootings of two black men by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He emphasized that "we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." The president insisted that race relations in the US have not reached a new low, citing a decrease in violent crime over the past 15 years. He renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence, saying "we can make it harder" for people to carry out their anger with weapons. Obama sympathized with police officers who have "very little margin of error" in gun-filled communities, and cited the need to address the gun issue to ensure their safety. He also acknowledged the importance of confronting "non-state actors" like the Islamic State group, and the need to eliminate terrorist threats. The president sought to calm public anxiety about personal safety, emphasizing that violent crime is actually down in the US.
