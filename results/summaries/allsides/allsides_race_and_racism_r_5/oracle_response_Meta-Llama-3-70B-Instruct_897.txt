SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite the recent fatal shootings of two black men by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He emphasized that "we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." The president insisted that race relations in the US have not regressed to the 1960s, citing a decrease in violent crime over the past 15 years. He revived a task force to address police-community relations and pledged to continue talking about stopping gun violence, making it "harder" for people to carry out their anger with weapons. Obama sympathized with police officers in gun-filled communities, highlighting the need to address the gun issue to ensure their safety. He also acknowledged the threat of non-state actors like the Islamic State group, which the US will need to confront in the years to come.
