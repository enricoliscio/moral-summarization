SUMMARY: President Obama addressed race relations, gun control, and global issues in a recent press conference during his final NATO summit in Warsaw, Poland. Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations following the fatal shootings of two black males by police officers and the subsequent killing of five Dallas law enforcement officials by a gunman. He denied claims that race relations have reached a new low and announced the revival of a task force to discuss next steps with police officers, community activists, and civil rights activists. Obama also renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence, calling for stricter gun control measures to prevent angry individuals from carrying out attacks. The President compared the Dallas sniper to the Orlando nightclub shooter, describing them as "demented individuals" who do not represent the American people. He declined to label the Dallas attack as a hate crime but emphasized the difficulty of interpreting the shooter's motives. Obama also discussed the challenges faced by police officers in communities with widespread gun ownership. Additionally, he tried to ease concerns about personal safety by highlighting the decrease in violent crime in the U.S. Finally, Obama reflected on his two terms as President and the ongoing fight against terrorist groups like ISIS, while also addressing Brexit and its potential impact on the global economy.
END OF SUMMARY.
