SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations in the aftermath of recent police shootings and the Dallas sniper attack. He emphasized that the actions of a few individuals should not define the entire nation. Obama argued that race relations have not regressed to the point of 1960s rioting, citing a decrease in violent crime over the past 15 years. He also renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence, saying it's harder for people to carry out their anger with weapons. The president spoke sympathetically of police officers in gun-filled communities and called for a focus on the gun issue. He also tried to calm public anxiety about personal safety, saying violent crime is actually down in the US. Additionally, Obama discussed his views on Brexit, ISIS, and NATO, emphasizing the importance of a sensible and orderly exit process for the UK from the EU.
