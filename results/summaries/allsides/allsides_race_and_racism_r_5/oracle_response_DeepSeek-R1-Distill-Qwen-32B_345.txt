Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has already provided the article and the list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary using those words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama is addressing recent events involving police shootings of black males and the retaliatory attack in Dallas. He's emphasizing optimism, unity, and the need for action against violence and racial tension. He mentions reviving a task force and discusses gun control and police safety. 

I should include the key events: the shootings, the protests, the Dallas attack, the task force, and Obama's comments on violence and unity. I need to use the listed moral words like "shot," "killed," "protests," "violence," etc.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Obama's calls for unity, his dismissal of regression in race relations, the task force initiative, his stance on gun control, and his acknowledgment of the challenges faced by police. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it flows naturally while including as many moral terms as possible.

Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence captures a key point without losing the moral framing. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY:  
President Obama addressed the nation amid recent tragic events, including the fatal shootings of black males by police and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas officers. He urged unity, stating, "We cannot let the actions of a few define all of us," and dismissed claims that race relations have regressed to 1960s levels. Obama revived a task force to address police-community relations, emphasizing progress despite the "loss of life" and "violence." He called for efforts to "stop" racial tension and reduce access to weapons, linking gun availability to incidents like the Dallas attack and the fatal shooting of Philando Castile. Obama described the Dallas sniper as a "demented individual," not representative of the nation, and acknowledged the "anxiety" surrounding safety. He also highlighted the challenges faced by police in "gun-filled communities," urging action to "eliminate" threats and reduce "crime." Obama reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to partnerships against terrorism and warned of the dangers of globalization's "inequality." He stressed the importance of unity and progress in addressing these issues.  
END OF SUMMARY.
