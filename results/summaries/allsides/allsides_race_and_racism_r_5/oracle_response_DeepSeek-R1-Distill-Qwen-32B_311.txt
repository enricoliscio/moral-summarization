Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the key points and the moral language used.

The article is about President Obama addressing the nation after several incidents involving shootings by police and a retaliatory attack in Dallas. He emphasizes optimism and unity, while also discussing policy measures and the complexities of addressing racial tensions and gun violence.

I notice that the user has provided a list of morally framed words that need to be included in the summary. These words are: shot, killing, killed, dying, rioting, shooting, protests, loss, crime, stopping, violence, harder, wounded, kill, attack, shootings, safety, set, dead, anxiety, attacks, confronting, eliminate, threats, inequality.

I need to ensure that as many of these words as possible are included in the summary without making it too verbose. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and should reflect the moral tone of the original article.

I'll start by outlining the main points:

1. Obama urges optimism despite recent shootings and attacks.
2. He dismisses claims that race relations have regressed to the 1960s.
3. Revives a task force to address police-community relations.
4. Mentions the decrease in violent crime over the past decade.
5. Calls for addressing gun violence to reduce racial tensions.
6. Refers to the Dallas sniper and Orlando shooter as "demented individuals."
7. Acknowledges the difficulty police face in gun-filled communities.
8. Comments on Brexit and the UK's exit from the EU, emphasizing continued partnership.
9. Addresses military operations and the fight against non-state actors like ISIS.
10. Discusses the complexities of globalization and inequality.

Now, I'll need to weave these points into a coherent summary, using the morally framed words where appropriate. I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language accessible, while maintaining the moral weight of the original text.

I'll make sure to include words like "shot," "killing," "protests," "violence," "attacks," "safety," and "inequality" to reflect the moral framing. I'll also need to balance the positive aspects of Obama's message, such as optimism and progress, with the challenges and losses mentioned.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within 200 words and flows naturally, preserving the moral tone.
