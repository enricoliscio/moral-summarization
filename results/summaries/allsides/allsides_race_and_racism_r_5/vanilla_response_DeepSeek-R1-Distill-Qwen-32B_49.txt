Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's comments after some recent events involving race relations, police shootings, and other issues. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

First, the article mentions that President Obama urged Americans to stay optimistic about race relations despite the recent incidents where two black men were shot by police, leading to a gunman killing five Dallas officers. He emphasized not letting the actions of a few define all of us. That's an important point about unity and not generalizing.

He spoke during his final NATO summit in Warsaw, Poland. He addressed the nation two days after the Dallas shootings and during protests about police violence against black men. He insists that race relations haven't reached a new low or regressed to the 1960s, which is a significant statement countering some arguments.

He revived a task force created after the Ferguson protests, which includes police, community activists, and civil rights leaders. The goal is to discuss next steps, showing a proactive approach to addressing the issues.

Obama also talked about the decrease in violent crime over the past decade, trying to provide a foundation for building a better future. He renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence, linking it to reducing racial tensions. He called the Dallas shooter and the Orlando gunman "demented individuals," not representing the broader community.

He declined to label the Dallas attack as a hate crime, noting it's hard to interpret motives, similar to other mass shootings. He expressed sympathy for police officers in dangerous communities, highlighting the difficulty in their jobs and the need to address gun availability.

He mentioned that even some protesters were armed, pointing out the prevalence of guns. He also discussed Philando Castile's shooting, where the victim was legally carrying a gun. He tried to calm fears by noting that violent crime rates are down.

On military operations, he said the U.S. isn't in active combat anymore but is training allies. He acknowledged that fighting non-state actors like ISIS will take time. Regarding Brexit, he wants the UK and EU to handle it sensibly and maintain close ties.

He also touched on globalization, acknowledging its risks but saying it's here to stay.

So, the summary needs to cover these points concisely: Obama's optimism, the task force revival, addressing gun violence, the shooters as outliers, the complexity of motives, support for police, and the broader context of crime rates and military strategy. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.
