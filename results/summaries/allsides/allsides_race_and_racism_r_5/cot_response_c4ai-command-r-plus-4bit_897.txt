SUMMARY: In the wake of recent tragic events involving fatal shootings of black males by police and the retaliatory killing of five law enforcement officers in Dallas, President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations. He insisted that race relations have not regressed to the point of 1960s rioting, arguing that violent crime has decreased. Obama committed to stopping gun violence and addressing the issue of police engagement with armed individuals. He called the Dallas sniper a demented individual and expressed sympathy for the difficult position of police officers in gun-filled communities. The president also tried to calm public anxiety by acknowledging the decrease in violent crime and the danger of hardening positions that could damage economies. Obama recognized the challenge of confronting non-state actors like ISIS and his goal of partnering with countries to eliminate terrorist threats. He also addressed Brexit, emphasizing the importance of a sensible and orderly exit process and the enduring friendship and commercial partnership between the US, UK, and EU. Finally, he acknowledged the dangers of globalization, including increased inequality and reduced worker leverage.
