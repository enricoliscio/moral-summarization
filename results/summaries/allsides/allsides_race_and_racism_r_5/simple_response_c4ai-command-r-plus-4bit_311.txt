SUMMARY: President Obama addressed Americans on race relations and gun violence in the wake of tragic events involving the deaths of several black males and police officers. He urged optimism and refuted claims of regression to 1960s-level racial tension, highlighting decreased violent crime rates. Obama revived a task force to discuss next steps with police officers and community activists. He emphasized the difficulty of interpreting the Dallas sniper's motives and declined to label the attack a hate crime. The President also renewed his commitment to reducing gun violence and acknowledged the challenges faced by police officers in communities with high gun prevalence. Obama compared the Dallas sniper to the Orlando shooter as "demented individuals" who don't represent Americans. He reflected on his two terms as President, the war on terror, and the challenges of confronting non-state actors like ISIS. Obama also commented on Brexit, urging a sensible and orderly exit process. He concluded by assuring Europe of America's continued support.
