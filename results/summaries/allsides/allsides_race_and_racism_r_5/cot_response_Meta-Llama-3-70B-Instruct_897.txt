SUMMARY:
President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite the recent tragic events, saying "We cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." He emphasized that violent crime in the U.S. has decreased over the past 15 years, and that race relations have not regressed to the point of 1960's rioting. The president also renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence, calling the Dallas sniper a "demented individual" who doesn't speak for all of us. He acknowledged the difficulties faced by police officers in communities where guns are prevalent, and stressed the importance of addressing the gun issue to ensure their safety. Obama also tried to calm public anxiety about personal safety, saying that violent crime is actually down in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
