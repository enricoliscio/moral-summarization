SUMMARY:
President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite recent tragic events, emphasizing that "we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." He acknowledged the tough and depressing loss of life, but insisted that race relations have not regressed to the 1960s. Obama revived a task force to discuss next steps, including police officers, community, and civil rights activists. He argued that violent crime has decreased over the past 15 years and that gun violence can be addressed. The president sympathetically recognized the difficult decisions police officers face in gun-filled communities. He also called for a sensible and orderly Brexit process, warning against damaging economies. Throughout, Obama emphasized the importance of care, safety, and calm in the face of anxiety and violence. END OF SUMMARY.
