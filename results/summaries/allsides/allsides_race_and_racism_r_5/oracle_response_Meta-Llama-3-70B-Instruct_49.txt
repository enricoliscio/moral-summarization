SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite the recent killings of two black men by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He emphasized that "we cannot let the actions of a few define all of us." Obama insisted that race relations have not regressed to the point of 1960's rioting, citing decreased violent crime rates over the past 15 years. He renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence, calling the Dallas sniper a "demented individual" who "wanted to kill white people, especially white officers." Obama sympathized with police officers working in gun-filled communities, saying they have "very little margin of error" when engaging with potentially armed individuals. He also addressed public anxiety about personal safety, stating that violent crime is actually down in the U.S. The president acknowledged the need to confront terrorist threats and eliminate inequality, emphasizing the importance of partnering with countries to achieve these goals.
