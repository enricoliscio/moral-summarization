Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Obama urged Americans to stay optimistic about race relations after some tragic events. Two black men were shot by police, and then a gunman killed five Dallas officers. Obama spoke about not letting the actions of a few define everyone. He also mentioned that race relations haven't reached a new low or regressed to the 1960s riots. He's复兴了之前成立的任务组，旨在改善警察和社区的关系。这个任务组包括警察、社区活动家和民权人士，他们将讨论下一步行动。

Obama还提到美国的暴力犯罪率在过去几年有所下降，尽管最近的事件让人感到沮丧。他还重申了他对制止枪支暴力的承诺，认为减少种族紧张需要时间，但可以采取措施防止人们用武器发泄愤怒。他将达拉斯枪手Johnson和奥兰多枪手Mateen称为“疯狂的个人”，认为他们不代表所有人。

在谈到枪支问题时，奥巴马提到即使在和平抗议中，有些人也携带枪支，比如德州的情况，以及明尼苏达州的Castile案件。他还试图缓解公众对安全的担忧，指出暴力犯罪率实际上在下降。

此外，Obama还讨论了美国的军事行动，特别是与ISIS的斗争，以及英国脱欧的问题，强调美欧关系的重要性。他还提到了全球化的问题，认为它虽然有风险，但会长期存在。

现在，我需要将这些要点浓缩成一个200字以内的总结。要确保涵盖主要事件、Obama的观点、任务组的成立、枪支问题、以及他的一些其他政策观点。要保持简洁，用连贯的句子连接这些信息。

可能会遗漏一些细节，比如Brexit的具体内容，但主要焦点应放在奥巴马对种族关系、枪支暴力和任务组的讨论上。确保总结清晰明了，涵盖所有关键点。

SUMMARY: President Obama addressed the nation's racial tensions following the fatal shootings of two black men by police and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas officers. He urged optimism, stating that recent events should not define the country and that race relations have not regressed to the 1960s. Obama revived a task force, including police, community, and civil rights leaders, to address police-community relations. He acknowledged the tragic week but emphasized progress in reducing violent crime over the past decades. Obama also highlighted the importance of addressing gun violence, noting that even peaceful protesters in Texas were armed. He called the Dallas gunman a "demented individual" and stressed that such acts do not represent the nation. Obama reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to partnering with allies against terrorism and supporting Europe post-Brexit. He also discussed the complexities of globalization. END OF SUMMARY.
