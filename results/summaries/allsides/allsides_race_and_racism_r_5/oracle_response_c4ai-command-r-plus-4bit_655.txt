SUMMARY: President Obama addressed Americans on Saturday, urging optimism amid tensions following the shooting deaths of two black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law enforcement officials by a gunman. Obama argued that race relations have not reached a new low and highlighted the decrease in violent crime over the years. He committed to stopping gun violence and discussed the challenges faced by police officers in gun-filled communities. Obama also renewed a task force on police shootings and civil rights, emphasizing the need to make it harder for people to act on their anger with weapons. The President equated the Dallas sniper, Micah Johnson, with the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, as "demented individuals" who do not represent the nation. He declined to label the Dallas attack as a hate crime but acknowledged the difficulty in interpreting the shooter's motives. Obama acknowledged the challenges of confronting non-state actors like ISIS and the need for partnership with other nations to eliminate terrorist threats. He also commented on Brexit, emphasizing the need for a sensible and orderly exit process. The President reflected on his two terms in office, the ongoing war, and the shift from active combat to training and assistance for partner nations.
END OF SUMMARY.
