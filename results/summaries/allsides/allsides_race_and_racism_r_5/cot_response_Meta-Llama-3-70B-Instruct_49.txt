SUMMARY:
President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations, despite the recent fatal shootings of two black men by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He insisted that race relations have not reached a new low, citing a decrease in violent crime over the past 15 years. Obama revived a task force to discuss next steps, including police officers, community and civil rights activists. He called the Dallas sniper a "demented individual" and emphasized that such actions do not define all of us. The president also stressed the need to address gun violence, saying it's hard for police to make decisions in gun-filled communities. He sought to calm public anxiety, noting that violent crime is down, and expressed commitment to stopping gun violence. END OF SUMMARY.
