Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's speech. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that Obama urged Americans to stay optimistic about race relations after some tragic events involving police shootings and a retaliatory attack in Dallas. He talked about not letting a few actions define the whole country. That's an important point for the summary.

He also addressed the idea that race relations haven't hit a new low, comparing it to the 1960s. He mentioned reviving a task force from the Ferguson incident, which included various groups to discuss next steps. That's another key point.

Obama emphasized that despite the tragic events, there's a foundation to build on, pointing out that violent crime has decreased over the past few decades. He also connected this to gun violence, saying that reducing it can help ease racial tensions. That's a crucial link between his policies and the current issues.

He referred to the Dallas shooter and the Orlando attacker as "demented individuals," not representing the country. This shows his stance on such attacks and the importance of not generalizing from these incidents.

The article also touches on his views on NATO, Brexit, and the military strategy against ISIS. He mentioned that the U.S. is now training and assisting rather than being in active combat, except against ISIS. That's part of his broader strategy.

Regarding Brexit, he wants the UK and EU to handle it sensibly and maintain close ties with the U.S. He's supportive but cautious about globalization, noting its benefits and dangers.

Putting it all together, the summary should cover his optimism, the task force, the decrease in crime, the connection to gun control, his comments on the shooters, and his military and Brexit stance. I need to make sure it's concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points clearly.
