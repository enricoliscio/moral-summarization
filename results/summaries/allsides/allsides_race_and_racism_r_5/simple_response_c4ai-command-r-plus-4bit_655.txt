SUMMARY: Speaking in Warsaw, Poland, at the end of his final NATO summit, President Obama addressed recent tragic events in the United States, including the fatal shootings of two black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law enforcement officers by a black Army veteran. Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations, arguing that the situation has not reached a new low and that violent crime has decreased in recent years. He emphasized the need to reduce access to guns, highlighting the presence of firearms in communities and the challenge they pose to police officers. Obama also announced the revival of a task force to address police-community relations and reiterated his commitment to combating gun violence. He compared the Dallas sniper and the Orlando nightclub shooter, describing them as "demented individuals" who do not represent the nation. The President further reflected on his time in office, discussing the shift from active combat to training and assisting partner nations, and the ongoing challenge of confronting non-state actors like the Islamic State group. He concluded by addressing the UK's exit from the European Union, emphasizing the enduring friendship and commercial partnership between the US and both entities.
