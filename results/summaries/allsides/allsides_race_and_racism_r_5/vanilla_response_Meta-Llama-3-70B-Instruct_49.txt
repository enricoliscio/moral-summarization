SUMMARY:

President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite recent tragic events, including the fatal shooting of two black men by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He emphasized that the actions of a few individuals should not define the entire nation. Obama argued that race relations have not regressed to the 1960s and that violent crime has decreased over the past 15 years. He also renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence and announced plans to revive a task force formed after the Ferguson shooting to discuss next steps with police officers, community activists, and others. Obama called the Dallas sniper a "demented individual" and urged Americans to recognize that police officers face difficult decisions in gun-filled communities. He also addressed the Brexit issue, emphasizing the importance of a sensible and orderly exit process.
