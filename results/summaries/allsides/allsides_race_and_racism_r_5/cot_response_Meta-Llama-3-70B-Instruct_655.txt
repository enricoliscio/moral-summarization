SUMMARY:
President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations despite the recent fatal shootings of black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five Dallas law-enforcement officials. He insisted that race relations have not regressed to the point of 1960's rioting, saying "that's just not true." Obama argued that violent crime in the U.S. has decreased over the past 15 years, and he revived a task force to discuss next steps. He called the Dallas sniper a "demented individual" and emphasized that such actions don't speak for all of us. The president sympathetically acknowledged the difficulties faced by police officers in gun-filled communities and stressed the need to address gun violence. He also tried to calm public anxiety about personal safety, saying violent crime is actually down in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
