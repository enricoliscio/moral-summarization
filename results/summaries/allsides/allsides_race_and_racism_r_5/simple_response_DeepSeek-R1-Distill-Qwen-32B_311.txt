Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's comments on race relations and other issues. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article starts with Obama urging optimism about race relations after some tragic events involving police shootings and a retaliatory attack. He mentions that we shouldn't let a few actions define everyone. He also says that race relations haven't regressed to the 1960s, which is a key point about progress.

He revived a task force from the Ferguson incident, including police, activists, etc., to discuss next steps. This shows his commitment to addressing the issues constructively.

Obama also talks about the decrease in violent crime over the past decades, trying to reassure people that things aren't as bad as they seem. He mentions the Dallas sniper, comparing him to the Orlando shooter, emphasizing that these individuals don't represent the majority.

He addresses the complexity of interpreting motives in mass shootings, which is a nuanced point. He also discusses the challenges police face, especially in areas with high gun availability, tying it back to the need for gun control.

He mentions specific examples like the Texas protesters and Philando Castile's case to highlight the prevalence of guns. He also touches on the importance of partnerships in fighting terrorism and his stance on Brexit, ensuring the US remains a friend to both the UK and EU.

Finally, he critiques globalization, noting its benefits but also the risks of inequality. 

Now, I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include the key moral points: optimism despite tragedy, progress in race relations, the task force, decrease in crime, the shooters not representing the whole, police challenges, gun control, terrorism partnerships, Brexit, and globalization's pros and cons.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the main event, his optimistic message, the task force, crime stats, the shooters' context, police challenges, gun issue, terrorism, Brexit, and ending with globalization.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all these elements without getting too detailed.
