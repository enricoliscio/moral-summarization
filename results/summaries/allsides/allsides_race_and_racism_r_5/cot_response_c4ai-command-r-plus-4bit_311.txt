SUMMARY: In the aftermath of the fatal shootings of two black males by police officers and the retaliatory killing of five law enforcement officials in Dallas, President Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations. He insisted that race relations have not regressed to the point of 1960s rioting, arguing that violent crime has decreased. Obama renewed his commitment to stopping gun violence and eliminating racial tensions, calling the Dallas sniper and the Orlando shooter "demented individuals" who do not represent all Americans. He acknowledged the difficult job of police officers in gun-filled communities and the importance of calming public anxiety about safety. Obama also emphasized the danger of increased inequality and the need for partnership to confront global terrorist threats. He urged the UK and EU to ensure a sensible and orderly Brexit process, assuring that the US will always be a close friend and commercial partner to Europe. While not a booster of globalization, he acknowledged its permanence.
