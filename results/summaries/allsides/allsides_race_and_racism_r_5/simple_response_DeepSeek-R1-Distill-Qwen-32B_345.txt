Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's speech after the Dallas shootings. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

First, Obama is addressing the nation after two black men were shot by police and then a gunman killed five Dallas officers. He's urging optimism about race relations and doesn't want the actions of a few to define everyone. He mentions that race relations haven't regressed to the 1960s level, which some people argue. He's revived a task force from the Ferguson incident, including police and activists, to discuss next steps. He also talks about the decrease in violent crime over the past decade and renews his commitment to stopping gun violence, linking it to reducing racial tensions. He refers to the Dallas shooter as a "demented individual" and compares him to the Orlando shooter, emphasizing they don't represent all Americans. He avoids calling the attack a hate crime, citing difficulty in interpreting motives. He also discusses the challenges police face in armed communities and the presence of legally carried guns among protesters. He mentions Philando Castile's case and tries to calm fears about safety, noting that violent crime is down. He touches on military operations, Brexit, and globalization, but I think the focus is on the domestic issues related to race and guns.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral elements: the call for unity despite violence, the emphasis on progress over regression, the revival of the task force, the link between gun control and racial tension, the characterization of the shooters as outliers, and the broader context of police challenges and gun laws. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it reflects the author's moral stance as presented.

Let me structure it: Start with Obama's call for optimism, mention the recent events, his stance on race relations not being at a low, the task force revival, the focus on gun control as part of reducing racial tension, his characterization of the shooters, and the challenges faced by police. Maybe end with his broader points about crime trends and police safety.

I need to avoid including too much about NATO or Brexit since the focus is on the domestic moral framing. Also, ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point without getting bogged down in details.

Now, putting it all together concisely, making sure each key moral point is included without exceeding the word limit.

He emphasized that the actions of a few should not define the nation and rejected claims that race relations have regressed to the 1960s. Obama revived a task force to address police-community relations, including activists and law enforcement, and highlighted progress in reducing violent crime. He called the Dallas shooter a "demented individual," separate from the broader community, and linked gun control to reducing racial tensions. Obama also acknowledged the challenges faced by police in armed communities and the prevalence of legally carried guns, citing cases like Philando Castile. He stressed that violent crime rates are down and urged unity in addressing terrorism and global issues like Brexit. END OF SUMMARY.
