SUMMARY: President Obama addressed the nation following a wave of violent incidents, including the fatal shootings of black males by police officers and the killing of five Dallas law enforcement officers by a gunman. Obama urged Americans to remain optimistic about race relations and argued that progress has been made, citing the decrease in violent crime over the past years. He also emphasized that the actions of a few individuals do not define the state of race relations in the country. Obama announced the revival of a task force to address these issues and reiterated his commitment to stopping gun violence. He compared the Dallas sniper and the Orlando nightclub shooter as "demented individuals" who do not represent the nation. The President acknowledged the challenges faced by police officers in communities with high gun prevalence and called for a sensible and orderly process for Britain's exit from the European Union.

Obama reflected on his time in office, noting the shift from active combat to training and assisting partner nations in the fight against terrorist threats. He also discussed the challenges posed by "non-state actors" like the Islamic State group. While acknowledging the dangers of globalization, he stated that it is here to stay.

END OF SUMMARY.
