Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's speech. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts with Obama urging optimism about race relations after recent shootings. He mentions the killings of black males by police and the retaliatory attack in Dallas. He emphasizes not letting a few actions define everyone.

Next, he addresses the protests and the task force he revived after the Ferguson incident. The task force includes various groups to discuss next steps. He also talks about the decrease in violent crime over the past years.

Obama also touches on gun violence, linking it to the safety of police officers and the presence of guns in communities. He mentions the Dallas protesters being armed and the case of Philando Castile. He tries to calm fears about safety, pointing out the decline in violent crime.

He reflects on military operations, noting that the U.S. isn't in active combat anymore but is training allies. He also comments on Brexit, hoping the UK and EU handle it sensibly.

Lastly, he discusses globalization, acknowledging its benefits and challenges, like inequality, but says it's here to stay.

Now, I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: his optimism, the task force, gun violence, military operations, Brexit, and globalization.
