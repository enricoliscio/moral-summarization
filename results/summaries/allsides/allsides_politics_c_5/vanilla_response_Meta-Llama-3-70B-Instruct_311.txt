SUMMARY:

The article suggests that President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and disclose secret memos and documents from the Obama administration to counter doubts about his legitimacy. This would include revealing the legal basis for Obama's drone assassination program, US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the US bombing of Libya in 2011. The article argues that the Obama administration was secretive and often denied Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and that Trump should compel disclosures to prevent similar follies in the future. By opening the books, Trump can create goodwill, rein in abusive agencies like the TSA, and provide context for his policy decisions, such as replacing the Affordable Care Act. The article concludes that excessive secrecy fuels mistrust, and that transparency would be a booster shot for democracy.
