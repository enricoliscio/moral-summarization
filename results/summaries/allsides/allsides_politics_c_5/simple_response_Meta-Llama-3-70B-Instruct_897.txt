SUMMARY:

The article argues that President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by releasing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration. This would help to counter doubts about Trump's legitimacy and demonstrate a commitment to civil liberties. The author suggests that Trump should follow Obama's precedent of releasing Bush-era legal memos and disclose documents related to the drone assassination program, US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya. The article also criticizes the Obama administration's lack of transparency, citing its poor record on Freedom of Information Act requests and its tendency to stifle disclosures. By opening the books, Trump can help to restore trust in government and prevent similar follies in the future.
