SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and accusations of reckless governance. The best response is to follow President Obama's example of disclosing secret memos and increase transparency. Trump should reveal the legal memos behind Obama's "targeted killing" drone program and the U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya, exposing bureaucratic failures and potential violations of federal law. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has been largely ineffective, with federal agencies denying or censoring requests, including those related to Hillary Clinton's emails. A Trump administration should compel disclosures and expose cover-ups by agencies like the TSA, which has become increasingly intrusive and abusive under Obama. Releasing memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act and rushed regulations would boost democracy and trust in the federal government. Trump should open the books on Obama's secretive and potentially unlawful actions to increase transparency and restore trust in the government.
END OF SUMMARY.
