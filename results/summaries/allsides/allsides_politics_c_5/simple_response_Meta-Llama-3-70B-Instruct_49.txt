SUMMARY:

The article argues that President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by releasing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration. This would expose the extent of power commandeered by the previous administration and vindicate Trump's warnings about US intervention in Syria and Libya. The article criticizes the Obama administration's lack of transparency, citing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as a "mirage" and highlighting instances of censorship, stonewalling, and secrecy. It suggests that Trump's administration could disclose documents without endangering national security, but rather, it would help to prevent similar follies in the future and boost democracy. By doing so, Trump would demonstrate a commitment to civil liberties and transparency, unlike his predecessor.
