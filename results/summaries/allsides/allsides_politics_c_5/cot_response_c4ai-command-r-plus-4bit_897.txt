SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and accusations of reckless governance from his opponents. To counter these moral charges, he should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos and white papers that expose the previous administration's actions. Trump should reveal the legal justifications for Obama's targeted killing drone program and the U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya, where the U.S. has allegedly armed Al Qaeda-linked groups. Exposing bureaucratic smoking guns and preventing future follies is vital, especially since federal agencies have a history of censoring and denying access to information. The Obama administration set records for secrecy, with the State Department and DHS facing criticism for their handling of FOIA requests. Trump can boost democracy and transparency by revealing the back story of the Obama era, including memos on the Affordable Care Act and rushed regulations. With low trust in the federal government, exposing the truth behind excessive secrecy is a moral imperative. END OF SUMMARY.
