SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy from the start of his presidency. To counter this, he should follow President Obama's example in 2009 and disclose secret memos and white papers from the Obama administration. This includes revealing the legal justifications for the "targeted killing" drone program, U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya, and the bureaucratic stonewalling of FOIA requests. Exposing these secrets would vindicate Trump's warnings about intervention in Syria and Libya, and show the public how the Obama administration commandeered power and ignored transparency laws. It would also expose the bureaucratic fiasco and excessive secrecy that spur Americans to presume their rulers are up to no good. Trump should also disclose the memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act, which were recently deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge. Laying out the back story of the Obama era would be a booster shot for democracy and help prevent future follies.
END OF SUMMARY.
