SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face challenges to his legitimacy and accusations of reckless governance. To counter these, he should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos and white papers from the previous administration, exposing their abuse of power. This includes memos on the "targeted killing" drone program, U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya, and the Affordable Care Act. By doing so, Trump can improve transparency, hold the previous administration accountable, and build goodwill. Obama boasted of transparency but set records for censoring and denying access to information. Exposing these secrets will boost democracy and show that truth will prevail. Trump has a chance to uphold moral standards and restore trust in the federal government.

END OF SUMMARY.
