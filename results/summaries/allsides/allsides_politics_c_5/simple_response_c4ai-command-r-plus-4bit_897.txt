SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump faces challenges to his legitimacy and accusations of reckless behavior. To counter these, he should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos and legal papers related to controversial policies, such as the drone assassination program and intervention in foreign conflicts like Syria and Libya. This would expose the truth behind Obama's actions and potentially prevent similar mistakes in the future. Additionally, Trump should address the failures of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by compelling disclosures and increasing transparency, especially in agencies like the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security, which have a history of abusive practices and excessive secrecy. Releasing memos related to Obama's "fixes" for the Affordable Care Act and other controversial regulations would also be beneficial. By exposing the back story of the Obama era, Trump can rebuild trust in the federal government and boost democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
