SUMMARY:

President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and expose the secret memos and papers of the Obama administration to dispel doubts about his legitimacy. By doing so, he can vindicate his warnings about US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, where the US has armed and bankrolled Al Qaeda-linked groups despite federal law prohibiting support to terrorist groups. Trump should also reveal the paper trail preceding the US bombing of Libya, which has led to chaos. The Obama administration's secrecy has been a "mirage," with federal agencies slamming the door on routine requests and stonewalling FOIA requests. The Department of Homeland Security has a dreadful FOIA record, and the Transportation Security Administration conceals information about its intrusive and abusive practices. By exposing these cover-ups and reining in these agencies, Trump can create a "bounty of early good will" for his administration. Ending excessive secrecy will be a "booster shot for democracy" and help rebuild trust in the federal government. END OF SUMMARY.
