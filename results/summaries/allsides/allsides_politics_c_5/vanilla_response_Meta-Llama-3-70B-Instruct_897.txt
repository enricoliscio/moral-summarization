SUMMARY:

The article suggests that President-elect Donald Trump should release secret memos and documents from the Obama administration to prove his legitimacy and expose the previous administration's actions. This would include revealing the legal basis for the "targeted killing" drone program, the paper trail on US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the decision-making process behind the US bombing of Libya in 2011. The article argues that the Obama administration was secretive and evaded transparency, with federal agencies denying or censoring requests for information. By releasing these documents, Trump can demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability, which would be a positive step for democracy. This would also help to prevent similar mistakes in the future and increase trust in the federal government.
