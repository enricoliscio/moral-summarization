SUMMARY:
President-elect Donald Trump should follow President Obama's precedent of transparency by releasing secret memos and white papers on controversial issues. This would expose the Obama administration's "reckless" and "commandeered" power, revealing the "bureaucratic smoking guns" behind the drone assassination program, US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya. The Trump administration should "turnabout" Obama's lack of transparency, which has led to "excessive secrecy" and erosion of trust in the government. By opening the books, Trump can prevent similar "follies" in the future and create a "bounty of early good will" for his administration. This would be a "booster shot for democracy," increasing trust and transparency in government. END OF SUMMARY.
