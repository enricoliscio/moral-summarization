SUMMARY:

President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and expose the secret memos and papers of the Obama administration to dispel doubts about his legitimacy. By doing so, he can follow the precedent set by President Obama, who released Bush administration legal memos, and demonstrate his commitment to civil liberties. Trump should reveal the memos underlying Obama's "targeted killing" drone program, as well as the paper trail on U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War, which has involved arming and bankrolling Al Qaeda-linked groups. The administration should also disclose the records on the U.S. bombing of Libya, which has led to chaos. The Obama administration's excessive secrecy, including its "bureaucratic bulldozing" and "stonewalling" of FOIA requests, has eroded trust in the government. By opening the books, Trump can help restore trust and prevent similar follies in the future. This would be a "booster shot for democracy" and demonstrate his commitment to transparency and good governance.

END OF SUMMARY.
