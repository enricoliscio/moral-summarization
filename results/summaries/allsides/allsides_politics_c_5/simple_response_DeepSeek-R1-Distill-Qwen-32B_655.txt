Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President-elect Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and the suggestion that he should release secret memos from the Obama administration. The author is framing this as a moral issue, highlighting the importance of transparency and accountability. I should focus on the main points: Trump's response to opposition, releasing memos on drone programs, Syria intervention, Libya bombing, FOIA issues, TSA's secrecy, and the impact on public trust. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and preserves the moral angle of promoting transparency to rebuild trust in government. I'll structure it by first stating Trump's challenge, then the proposed actions, and conclude with the benefits of these actions. I should avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump faces skepticism about his legitimacy, with opponents likely accusing him of reckless governance. To counter this, the article suggests Trump should follow President Obama's precedent by releasing secret legal memos, particularly those justifying Obama's drone assassination program and interventions in Syria and Libya. These disclosures would expose past overreach and align with Trump's campaign warnings. The article criticizes Obama's administration for claiming transparency while resisting FOIA requests, leading to a lack of accountability. By opening classified files, Trump could demonstrate commitment to transparency, rebuild public trust, and prevent future policy mistakes. Such actions would highlight bureaucratic failures, like the TSA's secrecy, and challenge the Obama era's policies, offering a moral framework for accountability and democratic integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
