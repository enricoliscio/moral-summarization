SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and be accused of reckless governance by his opponents. To counter these charges, he should follow President Obama's example of releasing secret Bush administration memos in 2009 and disclose the legal memos behind Obama's drone assassination program and intervention in the Syrian Civil War and Libya. This would expose the bureaucratic failures of the Obama administration and demonstrate Trump's commitment to transparency. Additionally, Trump should address the failures of the Freedom of Information Act under Obama, where federal agencies routinely denied access to information. Exposing cover-ups by agencies like the TSA and releasing memos behind Obama's healthcare "fixes" would also build trust in the Trump administration. By revealing the back story of the Obama era, Trump can boost democracy and show his commitment to governing with transparency.
END OF SUMMARY.
