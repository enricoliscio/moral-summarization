END OF SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and be portrayed by his opponents as reckless and unprecedented. The best response to such charges is to follow President Obama's example and release secret memos. Trump should disclose the memos behind Obama's drone assassination program and the legal rationale for the president acting as judge, jury, and executioner. He should also open the files on the Syrian Civil War and the U.S. intervention in Libya, exposing bureaucratic failures and the arming of Al Qaeda-linked groups. Exposing the paper trail preceding the Libya bombing could prevent future follies. It is vital to compel disclosures as FOIA requests are often denied or censored by federal agencies. Trump should also reveal the memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act, the IRS spending of billions in subsidies, and the rushed regulations issued without legislative transparency. Opening the books would expose midnight edicts, excessive secrecy, and bureaucratic abuses. Revealing the truth behind the Obama administration's actions would be a booster shot for democracy.
