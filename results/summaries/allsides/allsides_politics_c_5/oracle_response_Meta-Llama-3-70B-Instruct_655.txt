SUMMARY:

President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by exposing the secret memos and documents underlying the Obama administration's controversial policies. This would help to dispel doubts about Trump's legitimacy and demonstrate his commitment to civil liberties. By following Obama's precedent of releasing secret Bush administration memos, Trump can reveal the truth about the "targeted killing" drone program, the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya. This would help to prevent similar "follies" in the future and provide a "booster shot for democracy." The Obama administration's excessive secrecy, "bureaucratic bulldozing," and "stonewalling" of FOIA requests have eroded trust in the government. By opening the books, Trump can restore transparency, expose the "bureaucratic smoking guns," and prevent further "chaos" and "assault" on civil liberties. This would be a vital step towards rebuilding trust and ensuring that the government is accountable to the people.

END OF SUMMARY.
