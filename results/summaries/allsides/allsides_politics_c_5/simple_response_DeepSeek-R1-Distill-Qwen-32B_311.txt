Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article is about President-elect Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and how he should respond by revealing secret memos from the Obama administration. 

First, I should identify the main points. The author suggests Trump should release memos related to Obama's policies, like the drone program and Syria intervention. They argue this would expose Obama's overreach and boost Trump's credibility. Also, they mention the FOIA under Obama wasn't as transparent as claimed, and there's a call for more openness to rebuild trust.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral angle, which seems to be about accountability and transparency. The author is critical of Obama's administration's secrecy and believes Trump should use that to his advantage.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's strategy, the specific memos to be released, and the benefits of transparency. Also, mention the FOIA issues and the low public trust in government. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

Let me draft it: Start with Trump facing legitimacy issues, his plan to release memos, the examples like drone program and Syria, the FOIA problems under Obama, and the benefits of transparency for democracy. Make sure to include that this would expose past overreach and build trust.

I think that covers the main points and the moral framing. Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. Okay, looks good.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy upon taking office, with opponents likely accusing him of governing recklessly. The article suggests Trump should respond by releasing secret memos from the Obama administration, exposing its overreach and setting a precedent for transparency. Specifically, Trump should disclose memos related to Obama’s drone assassination program, U.S. intervention in Syria, and the bombing of Libya. These revelations would highlight past policy failures and bolster Trump’s credibility. The article criticizes Obama’s claims of transparency, noting that federal agencies under his administration often stonewalled Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, despite record-setting censorship. By opening these files, Trump could demonstrate accountability, reign in agencies like the TSA, and expose the flawed rationales behind Obama’s policies. Such transparency would rebuild public trust and serve as a moral corrective, holding past administrations accountable while promoting democratic integrity. END OF SUMMARY.
