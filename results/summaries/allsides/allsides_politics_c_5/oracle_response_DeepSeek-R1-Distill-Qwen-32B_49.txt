Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, and they provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It seems to argue that President-elect Trump should release secret memos and documents from the Obama administration to expose their overreach and lack of transparency. The author uses strong moral language to criticize Obama's administration and suggests that Trump's transparency would be a good move politically and morally.

I need to identify the key points: Trump facing legitimacy issues, the need to expose Obama's actions, specific examples like the drone program, Syrian intervention, Libya bombing, FOIA issues, TSA policies, and the Affordable Care Act. The author uses words like "commandeered," "entitled," "ignore," "disclosures," etc., which I should include in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight Trump's strategy to counter his opponents by exposing Obama's overreach. I'll mention the specific examples and the moral implications using the provided words. I'll also note the failure of FOIA under Obama and how transparency could benefit Trump's administration.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the moral terms as possible without making it sound forced. I'll start by stating Trump's strategy, then list the key areas where Obama's administration overstepped, and conclude with the benefits of transparency.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the moral framing and covers the main points without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump faces doubts about his legitimacy and should counter his opponents by exposing the Obama administration's overreach. The author argues Trump should release secret memos, such as those on Obama's "targeted killing" drone program, which allowed the president to act as judge, jury, and executioner. Revealing documents on U.S. intervention in Syria, where federal law was ignored by arming Al Qaeda-linked groups, and the Libya bombing, which led to chaos, would highlight past follies. The Obama administration's failure to disclose information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), despite claims of transparency, should be addressed. Trump should also expose the TSA's intrusive policies and the Affordable Care Act's secret memos, which bypassed proper procedures. By opening these records, Trump could rebuild trust and promote transparency, countering excessive secrecy that undermines public trust. END OF SUMMARY.
