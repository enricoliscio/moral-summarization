SUMMARY: The legitimacy of President-elect Donald Trump's administration will be questioned by his opponents, who will likely criticize his governance as reckless and unprecedented. To counter these charges, Trump should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos and legal papers detailing controversial policies and decisions made by the Obama administration. This includes the "targeted killing" drone assassination program, U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya in 2011. By disclosing these documents, Trump can expose the bureaucratic failures and potentially illegal actions of the previous administration, while also increasing transparency and accountability in government. Additionally, exposing cover-ups by agencies like the TSA and releasing memos related to the Affordable Care Act would further demonstrate Trump's commitment to transparency and good governance. These actions would help restore trust in the federal government and strengthen democracy.
