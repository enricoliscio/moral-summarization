SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and criticism for his policies from the start of his presidency. To counter these challenges, he should follow President Obama's example in 2009 and release secret memos and files from the Obama administration, exposing their overreach of power. This includes revealing the legal basis for the targeted killing drone program and the intervention in Syria and Libya, as well as the bureaucratic cover-ups and abuses of the TSA and DHS. Exposing these secrets would help Trump's agenda and boost democracy by showing the true nature of the Obama administration's actions. Trump should also release memos related to Obama's fixes for the Affordable Care Act, which were recently ruled unconstitutional. By opening these files, Trump can counter accusations and show the public the truth behind the Obama administration's actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
