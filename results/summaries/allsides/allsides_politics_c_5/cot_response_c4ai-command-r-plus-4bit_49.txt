SUMMARY:
President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy from the start. His *opponents* will likely accuse him of reckless governance. The best response to such *charges* is to expose how the Obama administration *commandeered* more power than Americans realized. Trump should follow Obama's *precedent* and release secret memos justifying Obama's drone assassination program. Trump should also disclose information on the US intervention in Syria and Libya, including arming and *bankrolling Al Qaeda-linked* groups, to *vindicate* Trump's *warnings*. Americans deserve to see the *smoking guns* on these decisions to prevent future *follies*. It is *naive* to expect truth from bureaucracies; it is *vital* to *compel disclosures*. Despite Obama's claims of transparency, his administration set records for *censoring* and *outright denying* information. Trump should release memos on Obama's healthcare fixes and reveal the back story of the Obama era to boost *democracy*.
END OF SUMMARY.
