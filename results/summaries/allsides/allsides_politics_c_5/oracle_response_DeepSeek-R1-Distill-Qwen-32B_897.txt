Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who wants a summary of a news article. The user specified that I should preserve the moral framing the author used. They even listed the morally charged words to include. Hmm, the article is about Trump and his approach to transparency, comparing it to Obama's administration. I need to make sure I include words like "commandeered," "ignore," "disclosures," and others they mentioned. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It talks about Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and how he should respond by revealing secret memos from Obama's administration. The author uses strong terms to describe the Obama administration's actions, like "commandeered power" and "targeted killing." I should highlight those to maintain the moral tone.

I also need to mention specific examples, like the drone program, Syrian intervention, and Libya bombing. Each of these has morally charged words associated with them. For instance, "armed and bankrolled Al Qaeda-linked groups" uses "armed" and "bankrolled," which are on the list. 

The article criticizes Obama's transparency record, using words like "mirage" and "stonewalling." I should include those to show the contrast between Obama's claims and actual actions. Also, the TSA's actions are described as "intrusive" and "abusive," which are important to include for the moral framing.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump's approach, then list the key areas where he should reveal information, using the moral words. Finally, I'll conclude with the benefits of transparency for democracy, tying it back to the moral implications.

Let me structure it: Trump's strategy, examples with moral terms, criticism of Obama's transparency, and the positive outcome. I'll make sure each point is brief and includes the necessary words. That should cover all the user's requirements while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump faces doubts about his legitimacy and should counter critics by revealing the Obama administration's secret memos and policies, which the author frames as morally questionable. Trump should follow Obama's precedent of disclosing Bush-era memos and expose Obama's "targeted killing" drone program, which bypassed legal safeguards. Revealing classified files on U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya could highlight past follies, such as arming Al Qaeda-linked groups and toppling Gadhafi, which led to chaos. The author criticizes Obama's claimed transparency, calling it a "mirage," as federal agencies stonewalled FOIA requests and concealed information. The TSA's intrusive patdowns and the IRS's secret memos on ACA subsidies are cited as examples of excessive secrecy. By exposing these records, Trump could regain public trust, rein in abusive agencies, and promote transparency, benefiting democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
