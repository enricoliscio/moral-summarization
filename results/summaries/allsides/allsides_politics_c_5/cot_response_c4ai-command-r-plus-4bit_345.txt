END OF SUMMARY:
President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy due to his opponents' portrayal of him as reckless and unprecedented. To counter these charges, Trump should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos detailing the Obama administration's controversial policies. This includes the "targeted killing" drone assassination program, the intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya. By exposing these secrets, Trump can vindicate his warnings about the dangers of intervention and reveal the bureaucratic smoking guns behind these fiascoes. In addition, Trump should expose the paper trail behind the IRS's unconstitutional "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act and the intrusive and abusive practices of the Transportation Security Administration. Opening the books on the Obama administration's midnight edicts and excessive secrecy would boost democracy and help restore Americans' trust in their government.
