Alright, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing the author used. The article is about President-elect Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and how he should respond by revealing information about the Obama administration's actions. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I need to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. The author suggests that Trump should open up secret memos from Obama's administration, especially regarding the drone program, Syrian intervention, and Libya bombing. The idea is that transparency would expose the previous administration's overreach and help Trump's legitimacy. The author also criticizes the Obama administration for excessive secrecy and FOIA stonewalling, which undermines trust in government.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words the author used. They include "commandeered," "entitled," "ignore," "disclosures," "judge," "jury," "executioner," "armed," "bankrolled," "support," "bureaucratic," "fiasco," "bombing," "attack," "chaos," "assault," "follies," "mirage," "boasted," "slammed," "requests," "kept," "claimed," "stonewalling," "permitted," "stifle," "intrusive," "abusive," "touch," "conceals," "groping," "caught," "exposing," "reining," "fixes," "actions," "rationales," "evidence," "transparency," "secrecy," "good," "booster."

I should make sure to include these words where appropriate in the summary. The summary needs to flow well, so I'll structure it around the main suggestions: revealing memos, exposing overreach, criticizing Obama's transparency record, and the benefits of openness for Trump's administration.

I'll start by stating that Trump should respond to legitimacy doubts by revealing Obama's memos. Then, mention the specific areas like drones, Syria, and Libya. Highlight the moral issues like overreach, chaos, and follies. Criticize Obama's FOIA practices and secrecy, using words like "mirage," "boasted," "stonewalling." Finally, conclude with the benefits of transparency for democracy and trust.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine some points and ensure each sentence includes the key moral terms without being redundant. Let me draft a few sentences and check the word count.

First sentence: Trump should respond by revealing Obama's memos on drones, Syria, and Libya, exposing overreach and chaos. Second: Obama's FOIA stonewalling and secrecy, despite claims of transparency. Third: Benefits of transparency for democracy and trust.

That should cover the main points with the moral framing intact. Let me put it all together, making sure to include as many of the specified words as possible without making it too wordy.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump should address doubts about his legitimacy by revealing the Obama administration's secret memos, particularly those related to the "targeted killing" drone program, the Syrian Civil War, and the U.S. bombing of Libya. These disclosures would expose the Obama administration's overreach, such as arming Al Qaeda-linked groups and the chaos caused by the Libya intervention. The author criticizes Obama's "transparency" claims, noting his administration stonewalled FOIA requests and concealed information, including the TSA's intrusive "enhanced patdowns." Revealing these records would highlight the Obama era's follies and rebuild trust in government. Transparency would also aid Trump's policy agenda, such as replacing the Affordable Care Act, by exposing the shaky rationales behind Obama's regulations. Exposing such bureaucratic secrecy would foster accountability and restore faith in democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
