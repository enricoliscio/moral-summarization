Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President-elect Donald Trump and his approach to governance. The article suggests that Trump should release secret memos from the Obama administration to address doubts about his legitimacy. 

First, I'll identify the main points. The article mentions Obama releasing Bush administration memos, so Trump should do the same with Obama's memos on drone programs. It also talks about the Syrian Civil War and Libya intervention, suggesting that revealing those records would support Trump's campaign warnings. Additionally, the FOIA process under Obama was problematic, with agencies being unresponsive, and the TSA's secrecy on invasive screening methods. Releasing these documents would build trust and goodwill for Trump.

I need to condense this into a concise summary, highlighting Trump's strategy to expose Obama's administration's actions, the specific areas like drones, Syria, Libya, FOIA issues, and TSA secrecy. I should keep it under 200 words and ensure it's clear and covers all key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The article suggests that President-elect Donald Trump should address doubts about his legitimacy by revealing secret memos from the Obama administration, similar to how Obama exposed Bush-era memos. Trump should disclose memos on Obama’s drone program, U.S. involvement in Syria, and the Libya intervention, which could validate Trump’s campaign warnings. The article criticizes the Obama administration for excessive secrecy, citing FOIA stonewalling and the TSA’s concealment of invasive screening practices. By exposing these records, Trump could build goodwill and trust, countering perceptions of overreach and mismanagement. Ending excessive secrecy would also aid in reforming policies like the Affordable Care Act and highlight the need for transparency in federal actions. END OF SUMMARY.
