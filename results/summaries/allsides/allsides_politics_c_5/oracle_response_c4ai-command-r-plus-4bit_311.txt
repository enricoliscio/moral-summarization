SUMMARY: Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy as President. To counter this, he should follow Obama's example in 2009 when he released secret Bush administration memos justifying torture, deployment of troops in US cities, and ignoring the Fourth Amendment. Trump should reveal the legal memos behind Obama's "targeted killing" drone program and US intervention in Syria and Libya, exposing bureaucratic smoking guns and preventing future follies. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has become a mirage under Obama, with federal agencies denying and stonewalling requests. Trump should compel disclosures to expose bureaucratic coverups and create transparency. This includes revealing the "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act and exposing intrusive and abusive practices by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Exposing the back story of the Obama era would boost democracy and show that Trump's rulers are not up to no good.
END OF SUMMARY.
