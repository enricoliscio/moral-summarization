SUMMARY:

President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency by exposing the secret memos and papers of the Obama administration, which commandeered power and ignored civil liberties. Trump should follow Obama's precedent of releasing Bush-era legal memos, and now reveal the memos underlying Obama's "targeted killing" drone program, US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the US bombing of Libya. This would vindicate Trump's warnings and prevent similar follies in the future. The Obama administration's secrecy, censorship, and stonewalling of FOIA requests have led to a distrust of the federal government, with only 20% of Americans trusting it. By opening the books, Trump can boost democracy and restore transparency. The TSA's intrusive and abusive practices, the IRS's unconstitutional actions, and the EPA's scandals must also be exposed. Trump's promise to end and replace the Affordable Care Act would be assisted by releasing the memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the law. END OF SUMMARY.
