SUMMARY:
President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by releasing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration. This would expose the "reckless" and "unprecedented" power grabs by the previous administration and vindicate Trump's warnings on the Syrian Civil War and Libya bombing. By doing so, Trump can prove himself a "champion of civil liberties" and show that "turnabout is fair play." The Obama administration's "dreadful" record on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and its "Nixonian" approach to transparency must be reversed. Trump can create a "booster shot for democracy" by revealing the back story of the Obama era and ending the "excessive secrecy" that has led to a trust deficit. By taking these steps, Trump can prove that his administration is committed to transparency and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
