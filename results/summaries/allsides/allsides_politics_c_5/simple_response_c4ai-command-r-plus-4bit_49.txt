SUMMARY: Donald Trump will face challenges to his legitimacy as president, and his opponents will likely criticize his governance as reckless and unprecedented. To counter these charges, he should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos and legal papers related to controversial policies and programs, such as the "targeted killing" drone assassination program and the intervention in the Syrian Civil War. This would expose the questionable actions and decisions made by the Obama administration and help prevent similar mistakes in the future. Additionally, Trump should address the failures of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by compelling disclosures and improving transparency, especially regarding the Transportation Security Administration's abusive practices and the memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act. By revealing the truth behind the Obama era, Trump can boost democracy and restore trust in the federal government.
END OF SUMMARY.
