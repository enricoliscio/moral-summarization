Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. The article is about President-elect Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and how he should respond by revealing secret memos from the Obama administration. 

First, I should read the article carefully to understand the main points. The author is suggesting that Trump should release secret memos to expose Obama's overreach, similar to how Obama released Bush's memos. The memos include things like drone programs, Syria intervention, Libya bombing, and Obamacare. The author argues that this would expose past administration's actions, rebuild trust, and improve transparency.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: Trump's legitimacy issues, the call to release Obama's memos, examples of the memos (drone program, Syria, Libya, Obamacare), the FOIA issues under Obama, and the benefits of transparency for democracy.

I should keep it under 200 words and maintain the moral tone, which is about accountability and transparency. I'll structure it by introducing the problem, suggesting the solution (releasing memos), and the benefits of that action.

Let me start drafting: Trump faces legitimacy doubts, so he should release Obama's memos to expose overreach. Examples include drone assassinations, Syria intervention, Libya bombing, and Obamacare memos. These would show past administration's actions, which were kept secret. FOIA under Obama was ineffective, leading to distrust. Releasing these would restore trust and promote accountability.

Wait, I should make it flow better. Maybe start with the challenge Trump faces, then the solution of releasing memos, the specific examples, and the impact on transparency and trust.

I think that's a good structure. Now, I'll make sure each sentence is concise and covers all the necessary points without going over 200 words.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy upon taking office. To counter his opponents' claims of reckless governance, Trump should follow Obama's precedent by releasing secret memos, such as those behind Obama's drone assassination program, Syria intervention, Libya bombing, and Obamacare. These disclosures would expose past administrations' overreach and rebuild trust. Obama's FOIA record was poor, with agencies stonewalling requests, leading to public distrust. Trump's transparency could highlight past follies, like arming Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria or rushing regulations without evidence. Releasing such records would foster accountability, restore faith in democracy, and address widespread skepticism about federal government actions. END OF SUMMARY.
