SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and accusations of reckless governance. To counter this, he should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos detailing controversial policies, such as the "targeted killing" drone program. Trump should also disclose information on U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya, including arming Al Qaeda-linked groups and the effects of toppling Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The Freedom of Information Act has been largely ineffective under the Obama administration, with agencies denying or censoring requests. Exposing bureaucratic cover-ups, such as the Transportation Security Administration's intrusive "enhanced patdowns," would build goodwill for the Trump administration. Releasing memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act and rushed regulations would also boost transparency and accountability. Excessive secrecy fuels distrust in the federal government. Revealing the truth behind Obama's policies would be a boost for democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
