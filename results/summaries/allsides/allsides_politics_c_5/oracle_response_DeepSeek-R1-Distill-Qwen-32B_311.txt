Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about President-elect Trump and his approach to transparency. I need to make sure I include as many of the morally charged words as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author suggests that Trump should release secret memos from the Obama administration to expose their overreach. Words like "commandeered" and "entitled" are important here because they imply Obama took too much power. I should keep those.

The article mentions Obama's transparency as a precedent, so I'll note that. Then, it talks about the drone program, using terms like "judge, jury, and executioner." I need to include those to show the moral judgment on Obama's actions.

Next, the article discusses the Syrian Civil War, using words like "armed" and "bankrolled" to criticize the support of terrorist groups. That's a strong moral point, so I'll make sure to include those terms.

The bombing of Libya is another key point, with terms like "chaos" and "assault." These words highlight the negative outcomes of Obama's policies. I should also mention the FOIA issues, using "mirage" and "stonewalling" to show the administration's lack of transparency.

The TSA's intrusive actions and the ACA memos are other areas where the author uses moral language. I'll include words like "intrusive," "abusive," and "unconstitutional" to convey the criticism.

Finally, the article ties it all together by emphasizing the importance of transparency for democracy. I'll make sure to highlight how exposing these issues can rebuild trust.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary to flow from Trump's actions, through the various policies and their negative impacts, ending with the call for transparency. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all the key morally framed words.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump should address doubts about his legitimacy by exposing the Obama administration's secret memos and policies, which the author frames as excessive power grabs. Obama's own release of Bush-era legal memos set a precedent for transparency, but the author argues Trump should go further by revealing Obama's "targeted killing" drone program memos, which allowed the president to act as "judge, jury, and executioner." Disclosures about U.S. involvement in Syria, including arming Al Qaeda-linked groups, and the Libya bombing, which led to chaos, would highlight past follies. The author criticizes Obama's claim of being the most transparent administration, citing FOIA stonewalling and excessive secrecy. Revealing memos behind Obama's policies, such as the Affordable Care Act "fixes," would expose unconstitutional actions and bureaucratic overreach. The author emphasizes that transparency is vital for democracy, as excessive secrecy fuels distrust. By exposing these records, Trump could rebuild trust and demonstrate accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
