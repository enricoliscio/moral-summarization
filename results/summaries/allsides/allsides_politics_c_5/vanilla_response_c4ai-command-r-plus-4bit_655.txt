SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump should expose secret memos and files from the Obama administration to dispel doubts about his legitimacy and showcase his commitment to transparency. He should reveal legal memos justifying Obama's drone assassination program and intervention in the Syrian Civil War and Libya, despite lawsuits against their disclosure. This would set a precedent for transparency and help prevent future follies. Trump should also address the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests that have been stonewalled by federal agencies, including the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, to improve government transparency. Exposing cover-ups by agencies like the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) would create goodwill for the Trump administration. Releasing memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act and rushed regulations would also showcase Trump's commitment to transparency and good governance. By opening the books, Trump can boost democracy and address excessive secrecy concerns, regardless of his policy choices.
END OF SUMMARY.
