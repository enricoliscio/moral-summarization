Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, around 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about President-elect Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and the suggestion that he should release secret memos from the Obama administration to expose their overreach. The article highlights how Obama released Bush-era memos, so Trump should do the same, especially regarding drone programs, Syria, Libya, FOIA issues, TSA policies, and Obamacare.

Next, I need to identify the key moral words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like "commandeered," "disclosures," "judge," "executioner," "armed," "fiasco," "chaos," "stonewalling," "intrusive," "secrecy," "transparency," "exposing," "fixes," and "good" come to mind.

I should structure the summary to mention Trump's need to reveal Obama's memos, the specific areas like drones, Syria, Libya, FOIA problems, TSA issues, and Obamacare. Each point should include the moral framing words to convey the criticism of Obama's administration and the benefits of transparency for Trump.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll make each sentence concise. I'll start by stating Trump's challenge, then outline the actions he should take, using the moral terms to highlight the issues. I'll conclude by emphasizing the benefits of transparency and the current low trust in government.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll review to ensure it captures the essence of the article and maintains the moral framing intended by the author.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump faces doubts about his legitimacy, with opponents likely criticizing his governance as reckless. To counter this, Trump should follow Obama's precedent by releasing secret memos, exposing how the Obama administration "commandeered" power. Obama revealed Bush-era memos on torture and Fourth Amendment violations, earning a reputation for civil liberties. Trump should similarly disclose memos on Obama's "targeted killing" drone program, which allowed the president to act as "judge, jury, and executioner." Opening files on Syria and Libya interventions would expose the "fiasco" of U.S. involvement, including arming Al Qaeda-linked groups and the chaotic aftermath of Libya's bombing. Trump should also address the "excessive secrecy" under Obama, which stifled Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and expose the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) "intrusive" policies. Releasing memos on Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act could aid Trump's repeal efforts. By promoting "transparency" and exposing past "follies," Trump can rebuild trust and earn "goodwill." END OF SUMMARY.
