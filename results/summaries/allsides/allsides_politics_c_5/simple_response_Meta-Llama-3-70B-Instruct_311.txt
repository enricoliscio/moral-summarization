SUMMARY:

The article argues that President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by releasing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration. This would expose the extent of power commandeered by the previous administration and demonstrate Trump's commitment to civil liberties. Specifically, the article suggests that Trump should disclose memos related to the drone assassination program, US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya in 2011. Additionally, the article criticizes the Obama administration's lack of transparency, citing its record of censoring government files and denying access to information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). By releasing these documents, Trump can restore trust in the federal government and promote democracy. The article concludes that excessive secrecy has led to widespread distrust of the government, and that transparency is essential for a healthy democracy.
