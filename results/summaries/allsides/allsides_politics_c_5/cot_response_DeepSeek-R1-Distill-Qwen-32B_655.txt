Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the author's perspective. The article is about President-elect Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and how he should respond by revealing information from the Obama administration. The author suggests that Trump should open up secret memos and documents to expose the Obama administration's actions, which were seen as overstepping their authority.

In the first step, I need to identify all the single words that are morally framed. These are words that carry a strong positive or negative connotation related to ethics or values. I'll go through the article and pick out words like "pervasive," "doubts," "legitimacy," "reckless," "commandeered," "power," "secret," "torture," "troops," "Fourth Amendment," "unreasonable," "smoking guns," "fiasco," "chaos," "censoring," "deny," "stonewalling," "abusive," "groping," "unconstitutional," "scandalized," "suppress," "excessive," "untrustworthy," "booster shot," and "democracy."

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article into a concise version, making sure to include as many of these morally charged words as possible. The summary should highlight Trump's need to reveal past administration's actions, the unethical practices under Obama, and the benefits of transparency for democracy. I'll structure it to show the contrast between Obama's claims of transparency and the reality, and how Trump can use this to his advantage by promoting openness.

I should ensure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points: Trump facing legitimacy issues, the need for transparency, the Obama administration's overreach, examples like drone programs and Syria intervention, the failure of FOIA under Obama, and the benefits of exposing these issues for trust and democracy.

I'll start by stating Trump's challenge, then move to the proposed solution of revealing past secrets, mention specific examples, and conclude with the impact on trust and democracy. I'll make sure to use the identified moral words to maintain the framing.

**Summary:**
President-elect Trump faces doubts about his legitimacy, with opponents likely criticizing his governance as reckless. To counter this, he should emulate Obama's transparency by revealing secret memos from the Obama administration, which allegedly overstepped its authority. Examples include the drone assassination program, Syria intervention, and Libya bombing, which caused chaos. The Obama administration's use of FOIA to censor information and stonewall requests highlights excessive secrecy, eroding public trust. By exposing these issues, Trump can promote transparency, reign in abusive agencies like TSA, and restore trust in democracy. This approach would not only address past overreach but also prevent future follies, serving as a booster shot for democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
