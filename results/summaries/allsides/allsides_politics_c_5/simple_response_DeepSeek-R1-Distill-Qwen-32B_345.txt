Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. The article is about President-elect Donald Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and the suggestion that he should expose the Obama administration's secret memos and actions. 

First, I should identify the main points. The author argues that Trump should follow Obama's precedent by releasing secret legal memos, especially those related to Obama's drone program and other policies. This would show transparency and contrast with Obama's administration, which was supposedly more opaque despite claims of transparency. 

The article mentions specific examples like the Syrian Civil War intervention, Libya bombing, TSA policies, and the Affordable Care Act. It also criticizes the Obama administration for using FOIA stonewalling and excessive secrecy, which eroded public trust. 

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should make sure to highlight the moral aspect, which is the call for transparency and accountability. I'll start by stating Trump's challenge, then outline the proposed actions, and conclude with the benefits of transparency. 

Let me structure it: Trump faces legitimacy issues, so he should release Obama's secret memos. Examples include drone program, Syria, Libya, TSA, and ACA. These actions would expose past overreach and build trust. The author also criticizes Obama's transparency claims, showing the need for Trump's openness. 

I need to keep it concise, ensuring each key point is mentioned without getting too detailed. Also, maintain the moral framing by emphasizing the importance of transparency in democracy and accountability.
