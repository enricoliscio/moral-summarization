SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and accusations of reckless governing. To counter these charges, he should follow President Obama's example in 2009 and release secret memos and white papers from the Obama administration, exposing their abuse of power. This includes the legal justification for drone assassinations, U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya, and the bureaucratic smoking guns behind these fiascos. Trump should also address the lack of transparency within federal agencies, as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has become a mirage under Obama's administration, with agencies denying and stonewalling requests. Exposing cover-ups within agencies like the TSA and releasing memos behind Obama's "fixes" for the Affordable Care Act would boost Trump's reputation for transparency and democracy. It would also expose the back story of the Obama era, revealing the truth behind their secretive and intrusive policies.
END OF SUMMARY.
