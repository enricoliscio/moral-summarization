Alright, so the user wants me to summarize this news article. The article is about President-elect Donald Trump and the challenges he faces regarding his legitimacy. It suggests that Trump should release secret memos from the Obama administration to expose their actions and gain public trust. 

First, I need to understand the main points. The article talks about Obama's transparency when he released Bush administration memos, and now Trump should do the same for Obama's policies, like the drone program and Syria intervention. It also mentions the failure of the Freedom of Information Act under Obama and the need for Trump to push for more transparency. 

I should focus on the key actions Trump is advised to take: releasing memos on targeted killings, Syria, Libya, and the Affordable Care Act. Also, the article points out the issues with FOIA under Obama and the impact of excessive secrecy on public trust. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without getting too detailed. I'll start by stating Trump's challenge, then outline the specific memos he should release, mention the FOIA issues, and conclude with the importance of transparency for democracy. 

Let me structure it: Trump's challenge, his actions to counter Obama's policies, the problems with FOIA, and the benefits of transparency. Keep it clear and within the word limit. Make sure each sentence adds value and doesn't repeat information unnecessarily.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump faces skepticism about his legitimacy from day one. To counter critics, he should follow Barack Obama's precedent by releasing secret memos from the Obama administration, such as those justifying the "targeted killing" drone program, U.S. involvement in Syria, and Libya intervention. These disclosures would expose Obama's overreach and align with Trump's campaign warnings. Additionally, Trump should prioritize transparency by releasing memos related to the Affordable Care Act and Obama's regulatory overreach. The article highlights the failure of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) under Obama, with federal agencies denying requests and stonewalling lawsuits. Exposing such secrecy could rebuild public trust and restore faith in democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
