SUMMARY:
President-elect Donald Trump should follow President Obama's precedent of transparency by releasing secret memos and documents that expose the Obama administration's "reckless" and "abusive" power grabs. This would help to vindicate Trump's warnings about the Syrian Civil War and the U.S. bombing of Libya. The Obama administration's "dreadful" record on the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has led to excessive secrecy, which has eroded trust in the federal government. By opening the books, Trump can demonstrate his commitment to transparency and accountability, and help to prevent similar "follies" in the future. This would be a "vital" step towards restoring trust in government and promoting democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
