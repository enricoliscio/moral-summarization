SUMMARY:

The article suggests that President-elect Donald Trump should release secret memos and documents from the Obama administration to demonstrate transparency and accountability. This would help counter doubts about Trump's legitimacy and show that he is committed to civil liberties. The article proposes that Trump reveal documents related to the drone assassination program, US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya in 2011. Additionally, Trump should expose the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) abuses and stonewalling by federal agencies, including the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and Transportation Security Administration. By doing so, Trump can restore trust in the federal government, which has been eroded by excessive secrecy. Releasing these documents would be a boost to democracy and help prevent similar policy follies in the future.
