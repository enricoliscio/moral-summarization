SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face doubts about his legitimacy and criticism for his policies from the start of his presidency. To counter this, he should follow President Obama's example of releasing secret memos from the previous administration, exposing its overreach of power. Trump should reveal the legal justifications for Obama's drone assassination program and the intervention in the Syrian Civil War, where the U.S. armed Al Qaeda-linked groups. He should also disclose information on the 2011 bombing of Libya and the bureaucratic cover-ups that followed. By doing so, Trump can improve transparency and prevent future follies. Additionally, exposing the Transportation Security Administration's abusive practices and releasing memos on Obama's fixes to the Affordable Care Act would benefit Trump's agenda. These actions would boost democracy and show the public the inner workings of the Obama administration, helping to legitimize Trump's presidency.
END OF SUMMARY.
