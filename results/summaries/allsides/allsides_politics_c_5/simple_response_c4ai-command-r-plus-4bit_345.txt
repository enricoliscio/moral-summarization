SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face questions about his legitimacy and be accused of reckless governing. To counter these charges, he should follow President Obama's example in 2009 and release secret memos and legal papers related to controversial policies and programs, such as the "targeted killing" drone program and U.S. intervention in Syria and Libya. This would expose the bureaucratic smoking guns and prevent future follies. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has been largely ineffective, with federal agencies denying or censoring requests, especially from the media. Exposing cover-ups within agencies like the TSA and DHS would create goodwill for the Trump administration. Releasing memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act and midnight edicts would also boost Trump's agenda. Americans deserve transparency and exposing the back story of the Obama era would be a booster shot for democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
