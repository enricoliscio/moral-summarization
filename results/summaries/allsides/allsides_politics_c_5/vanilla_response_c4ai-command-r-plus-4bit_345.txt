SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump will face questions about his legitimacy and accusations of reckless governance. To counter this, he should follow President Obama's example and release secret memos and legal papers related to controversial policies, such as the drone assassination program and intervention in Syria and Libya. This would expose the Obama administration's overreach of power and increase transparency. Federal agencies have a poor track record of responding to Freedom of Information Act requests, with the Obama administration setting records for censoring or denying access to information. Exposing cover-ups within agencies like the TSA and releasing memos related to the Affordable Care Act would build goodwill for the Trump administration and boost democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
