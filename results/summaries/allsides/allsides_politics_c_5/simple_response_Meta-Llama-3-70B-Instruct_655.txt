SUMMARY:

The article argues that President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by releasing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration. This would expose the truth about controversial policies, such as the "targeted killing" drone program, U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the bombing of Libya. The author contends that the Obama administration was secretive and evasive, with a poor record on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. By opening the books, Trump can demonstrate a commitment to democracy and civil liberties, and help prevent similar mistakes in the future. The article suggests that excessive secrecy has eroded trust in government, and that transparency is essential for restoring faith in institutions.
