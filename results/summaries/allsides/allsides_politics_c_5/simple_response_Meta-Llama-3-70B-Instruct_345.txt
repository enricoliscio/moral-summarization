SUMMARY:

The article argues that President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by releasing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration. This would help to dispel doubts about Trump's legitimacy and demonstrate his commitment to civil liberties. The author suggests that Trump should follow Obama's precedent of releasing Bush-era legal memos and disclose the secret memos underlying Obama's "targeted killing" drone program, as well as documents related to US intervention in Syria and Libya. The article also criticizes the Obama administration's lack of transparency, citing its poor record on Freedom of Information Act requests and its use of secrecy to conceal controversial policies. By releasing these documents, Trump can help to restore trust in government and prevent similar mistakes in the future.
