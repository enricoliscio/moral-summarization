SUMMARY:
President-elect Donald Trump should follow President Obama's precedent of transparency by releasing secret memos and documents that expose the Obama administration's "reckless" and "unprecedented" power grabs. This would help to dispel doubts about Trump's legitimacy and show that he is a "champion" of civil liberties. By doing so, Trump would be taking a "fair" and "vital" step towards accountability. The Obama administration's "censoring" and "stonewalling" of information has led to a lack of trust in the government, with many Americans presuming that their rulers are "up to no good." By releasing the documents, Trump can help to restore trust and demonstrate a commitment to "transparency" and "democracy." This would be a "booster shot" for democracy and help to prevent similar "follies" in the future. END OF SUMMARY.
