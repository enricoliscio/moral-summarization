SUMMARY:
President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency and accountability by exposing the secret memos and papers of the Obama administration. This would be a "fair" response to doubts about his legitimacy and would follow the "excellent precedent" set by President Obama. Trump should reveal the legal memos underlying Obama's "targeted killing" drone program, the paper trail on U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the records preceding the U.S. bombing of Libya in 2011. The Obama administration's "censoring" and "slow walking" of FOIA requests, as well as its "dreadful" FOIA record, have led to a lack of trust in the government. By opening the books, Trump can create a "booster shot for democracy" and show that his administration is committed to transparency and accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
