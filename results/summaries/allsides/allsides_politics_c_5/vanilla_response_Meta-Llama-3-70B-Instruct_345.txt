SUMMARY:

The article suggests that President-elect Donald Trump should release secret memos and documents from the Obama administration to address doubts about his legitimacy and to promote transparency. This would include revealing the legal basis for Obama's drone assassination program, the US intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the US bombing of Libya in 2011. The article argues that the Obama administration was secretive and censored government files, and that Trump could improve democracy by opening up the books. This would also help Trump's policies, such as repealing the Affordable Care Act, by revealing the memos behind Obama's "fixes" to the law. The article concludes that excessive secrecy has led to mistrust of the federal government, and that transparency would be a booster shot for democracy.
