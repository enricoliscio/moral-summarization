Okay, I need to summarize this news article about President-elect Donald Trump and his approach to transparency. The article suggests that Trump should release secret memos and documents from the Obama administration to address doubts about his legitimacy. It mentions Obama's own release of Bush-era memos as a good precedent. 

So, the key points are: Trump should open up Obama's secret memos on drone programs, Syria intervention, Libya bombing, and ACA fixes. This would expose past overreach and build trust. The article also criticizes Obama's FOIA record, saying it was more secretive than claimed. By contrast, Trump's transparency could gain public support and improve democracy.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating Trump should release Obama's memos, then list the areas: drone program, Syria, Libya, and ACA. Mention how this would expose past actions and build trust. Also, note the FOIA issues under Obama and how Trump's approach could help democracy. Keep it concise and cover all main points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump is advised to address doubts about his legitimacy by releasing secret memos from the Obama administration, particularly those related to the drone assassination program, U.S. intervention in Syria, the Libya bombing, and the Affordable Care Act. This transparency would expose past overreach and build trust. The article highlights Obama's secrecy despite claims of transparency, with federal agencies often denying FOIA requests. By contrast, Trump's openness could foster public support and improve democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
