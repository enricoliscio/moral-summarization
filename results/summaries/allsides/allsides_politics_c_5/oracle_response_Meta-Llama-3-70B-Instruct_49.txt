SUMMARY:

President-elect Donald Trump should prioritize transparency by exposing the Obama administration's secretive dealings. The Obama team "commandeered" power, ignoring the Fourth Amendment and deploying troops in American towns. Trump should follow Obama's precedent of releasing secret memos, starting with those underlying the "targeted killing" drone program. This would vindicate Trump's warnings about the Syrian Civil War, where the US has "armed and bankrolled" Al Qaeda-linked groups despite federal law prohibiting it.

The article also highlights the Obama administration's "bureaucratic bulldozing" and "excessive secrecy," which has led to a "fiasco" in Libya and a lack of trust in the government. Trump should reveal the paper trail behind the US bombing of Libya and the "smart power" claims made by Hillary Clinton. By doing so, Trump can prevent similar "follies" in the future and promote democracy.

The article concludes that Trump should "expose" the TSA's "coverups" and "rein in" the agency's "intrusive and abusive" practices. By prioritizing transparency, Trump can restore trust in the government and create a "booster shot for democracy."

END OF SUMMARY.
