Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about President-elect Donald Trump facing doubts about his legitimacy and how he should respond by revealing secret memos from the Obama administration. It mentions Obama releasing Bush-era memos and suggests Trump should do the same for Obama's drone program, Syria intervention, Libya bombing, and Affordable Care Act memos. The article also criticizes the FOIA under Obama and the TSA's secrecy. It argues transparency would rebuild trust.

I should focus on the main points: Trump's need to reveal Obama's secret memos, examples of what to reveal, the FOIA issues, and the benefits of transparency. Keep it concise, under 200 words. Make sure to mention each key area without going into too much detail. Also, highlight the contrast between Obama's transparency and the current administration's secrecy. I'll structure it by listing the areas Trump should address and the impact of transparency on democracy and trust.

SUMMARY: President-elect Donald Trump faces skepticism about his legitimacy, and the article suggests he should counter this by revealing secret memos from the Obama administration. Trump should follow Obama's precedent of releasing Bush-era legal memos, which highlighted the Bush administration's overreach. Specifically, Trump should disclose memos related to Obama's drone program, U.S. intervention in Syria, and the 2011 Libya bombing. These disclosures could expose past follies and rebuild trust. The article also criticizes the Obama administration for failing to uphold transparency under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), with federal agencies often denying requests or stalling. Revealing such documents would not only expose past missteps but also demonstrate a commitment to openness, benefiting Trump's administration. Additionally, transparency regarding the Affordable Care Act and the Transportation Security Administration's secrecy could further enhance accountability. By opening these files, Trump could foster trust and credibility, countering doubts about his legitimacy. END OF SUMMARY.
