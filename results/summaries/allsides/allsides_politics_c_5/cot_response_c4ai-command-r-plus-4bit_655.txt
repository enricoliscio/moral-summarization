Obama
Era*

SUMMARY: Donald Trump will face pervasive doubts and opposition as he assumes office. The best response to charges of reckless governance is to expose how the Obama administration usurped power. Trump should follow Obama's example and release secret legal memos justifying torture and domestic troop deployment, as well as those related to drone assassinations and the Syrian Civil War. Trump should also reveal the paper trail behind the U.S. intervention in Libya and the bureaucratic failures in Syria. Transparency is vital to counter excessive secrecy and restore trust in the federal government. Exposing cover-ups by agencies like the TSA and IRS would create goodwill and aid Trump's policy agenda. Releasing memos on Obama's "fixes" to the Affordable Care Act and midnight edicts would further boost democracy and transparency. END OF SUMMARY.
