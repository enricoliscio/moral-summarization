Okay, I need to summarize this article about President-elect Donald Trump and his approach to governance, focusing on the moral framing the author provided. The article suggests that Trump should increase transparency by revealing secret memos and documents from the Obama administration. It mentions several areas like drone programs, Syrian intervention, Libya bombing, FOIA issues, TSA policies, and Obamacare memos. The author argues that by exposing these, Trump can gain public trust and justify his policies. I should make sure to capture the main points without going into too much detail, keeping it under 200 words. Also, the summary needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it to highlight Trump's call for transparency, the specific areas he should target, and the benefits of such actions for democracy and public trust.

SUMMARY: The article argues that President-elect Donald Trump should address doubts about his legitimacy by promoting transparency, akin to how President Obama disclosed Bush-era memos. Trump is urged to reveal secret memos behind Obama's drone program, U.S. involvement in Syria, and Libya bombing, which could validate Trump's warnings and expose past follies. The piece criticizes the Obama administration's FOIA stonewalling and excessive secrecy, suggesting that Trump's administration could gain public trust by opening these records. It also highlights the need for transparency in Obama's Affordable Care Act fixes and bureaucratic overreach. By exposing past administrations' actions, Trump could foster trust and strengthen democracy, countering the narrative of reckless governance. END OF SUMMARY.
