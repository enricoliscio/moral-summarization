SUMMARY:

A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier, sparking outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Trump and Attorney General Sessions criticized the verdict, with Trump calling it a "complete travesty of justice" and demanding cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. City officials, however, vowed to stand behind their "sanctuary city" policy, which they argue improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with conservatives lambasting the city as unsafe and Democrats defending the policy as necessary for protecting vulnerable communities. The case has become a symbol of the nation's divide on immigration, with Trump using it to justify his call for a border wall.
