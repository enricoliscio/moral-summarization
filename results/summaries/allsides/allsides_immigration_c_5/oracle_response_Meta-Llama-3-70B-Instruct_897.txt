SUMMARY:

The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, for the killing of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice," while U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. The city's "sanctuary city" policy, which allows immigrants to cooperate with police without fear, was defended by city officials, who argued it improves public safety. However, Trump and others used the tragedy to "demonize" and "slander" immigrants, suggesting they are all criminals. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation, leading to Steinle's tragic death. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with Trump calling for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
