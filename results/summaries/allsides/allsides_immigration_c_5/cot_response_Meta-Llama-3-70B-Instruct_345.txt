SUMMARY:
A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier, sparking outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice" and demanded cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. City officials vowed to stand behind their "sanctuary city" policy, which they argue improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. However, critics argue that the policy led to Garcia Zarate's release from jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation, and that it puts citizens at risk. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with Trump calling for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. END OF SUMMARY.
