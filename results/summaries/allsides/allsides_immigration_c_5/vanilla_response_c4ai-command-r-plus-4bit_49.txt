SUMMARY: A Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was acquitted of killing a woman, Kate Steinle, on a San Francisco pier, sparking widespread backlash and criticism of the city's immigration policies. President Trump and others called for a boycott of the city, with Trump referring to the verdict as a "travesty of justice." U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also criticized San Francisco's sanctuary city policy, which bars cooperation with federal deportation efforts. Twitter users used hashtags to advocate for the construction of a border wall, while conservative figures like Sarah Palin and James Woods joined in condemning the city as unsafe. Despite the backlash, San Francisco officials stood firm in their support of sanctuary city policies, arguing they improve public safety by encouraging cooperation between immigrants and police. The case has been used by some to demonize immigrants and call for stricter immigration laws, with Trump calling the verdict disgraceful and advocating for the building of a border wall. However, Garcia Zarate's prior convictions were immigration and drug-related, with no history of violence. The prosecutor had sought a first-degree murder conviction, but the jury rejected this, instead convicting him of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Steinle's father expressed his disappointment in the verdict, stating that justice was not served.
END OF SUMMARY.
