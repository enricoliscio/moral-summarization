Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article talks about the aftermath of a jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate for Kate Steinle's murder, leading to backlash against San Francisco's sanctuary city policies. President Trump and others criticized the city, calling for a boycott and the construction of a border wall. The city defended its policies, arguing they improve public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. The trial details show that Zarate was released despite federal requests for detention, which became a focal point for critics. The article also mentions how the case was used politically during Trump's campaign.

Now, I need to identify the morally framed words the author used. They include words like "travesty," "released," "shot," "improve," "continue," "use," "demonize," "slander," "suggesting," "help," "hurt," "possession," "remove," "death," "came," "protected," "crimes," "violent," "used," "exoneration," "convictions," "violence," "living," "reentry," "detain," "deportation," "shooting," "violation," "conviction," "overreached," "kill," "striking," "served."

I should incorporate as many of these words as possible into the summary without making it too long. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and include the key moral points: the criticism of sanctuary cities, the impact on public safety, the political backlash, and the trial's outcome.

I'll start by outlining the main events: the acquittal, the backlash, the city's defense, the trial details, and the political implications. Then, I'll weave in the morally charged words to reflect the author's framing. For example, using "travesty" to describe the verdict, "released" to show how Zarate was let go, and "demonize" to highlight the criticism against immigrants.

I should also ensure the summary flows logically, connecting the events and the moral implications. I'll make sure to include the opposing viewpoints: the city's stance on sanctuary policies improving safety versus the criticism that they protect criminals.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key points are covered with the appropriate moral language.

SUMMARY: After a jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle, critics accused San Francisco of being a "travesty" of justice and called for a boycott, demanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall be built. President Trump and others lambasted the city's sanctuary policies, which they claimed "demonize" immigrants and "slander" them as criminals. San Francisco defended its policy, arguing it "improves" public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was "released" from San Francisco's jail despite federal requests for detention. The trial revealed he was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, but jurors rejected murder charges. Critics, including Trump, used the case to "suggest" stricter immigration laws, while supporters argued the city's policies "help" vulnerable communities. The verdict left Steinle's family "saddened" and "shocked," with her father stating "justice was rendered, but not served." The city's stance on sanctuary policies remains unchanged, with officials vowing to "continue" protecting immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
