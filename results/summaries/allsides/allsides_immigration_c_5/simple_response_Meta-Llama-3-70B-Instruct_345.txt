SUMMARY:

A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in 2015. The verdict sparked outrage from President Donald Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and conservative politicians, who called for a boycott of San Francisco and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. They argued that the city's "sanctuary city" policy, which bars cooperation with federal deportation efforts, led to the tragedy. However, city officials and state Sen. Scott Wiener defended the policy, saying it improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Wiener condemned those who use the tragedy to "demonize immigrants" and perpetuate false stereotypes. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with Trump calling it a "complete travesty of justice." Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, will likely be deported again after serving his sentence.

END OF SUMMARY.
