Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points.

The article is about the aftermath of a court case in San Francisco involving Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who was acquitted of killing Kate Steinle. The verdict sparked a lot of reactions, including calls to boycott San Francisco and demands for a border wall. President Trump and others criticized the city's sanctuary policies. San Francisco defended its stance, saying it improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The article also explains the history of sanctuary cities and the legal details of the case, including the jury's decision and the subsequent reactions from politicians and the public.

I should focus on the key elements: the verdict, the reactions from Trump and others, the city's defense of sanctuary policies, the background of Garcia Zarate, and the broader implications of the case. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these points without getting bogged down in too many details.

I'll start by mentioning the acquittal and the immediate reactions. Then, I'll note Trump's and Sessions' calls for policy changes. Next, I'll include the city's support for sanctuary policies and the reasoning behind it. I'll also include the legal outcome and the family's reaction. Finally, I'll touch on the broader debate over immigration policies.

Let me structure this into a few sentences, ensuring each main point is covered succinctly. I should avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward. I need to make sure the summary flows logically from one point to the next, highlighting the conflict between federal and local policies and the public reaction.

I should also mention the judge's decision to exclude immigration politics from the trial, the jury's conviction on a lesser charge, and the family's disappointment. This will give a comprehensive overview of the situation without going into excessive detail.

Now, I'll draft the summary, keeping an eye on the word count and ensuring all critical aspects are included. I'll make sure it starts with the key event, then moves to the reactions, the city's response, the legal details, and the broader implications.
