SUMMARY:
There have been calls to boycott San Francisco after a jury acquitted a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, of killing a woman, Kate Steinle, on a popular pier. President Trump and others have condemned the verdict as a "travesty of justice," with Trump calling for the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The case has reignited debates around San Francisco's "sanctuary city" policy, which bars cooperation with federal deportation efforts. While city officials defend their commitment to being a sanctuary city, providing refuge for immigrants, religious and gender minorities, and non-English speakers, critics argue that such policies endanger public safety. The prosecutor in the case sought a first-degree murder conviction, but jurors only convicted Garcia Zarate of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The verdict has sparked outrage and disappointment, with Steinle's family expressing their shock and sadness at the outcome. END OF SUMMARY.
