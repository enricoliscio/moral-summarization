Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully to understand the main points. The article is about the aftermath of a jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in San Francisco. It seems there's a lot of controversy around this verdict, especially regarding the city's sanctuary policies.

First, the key events: Garcia Zarate was acquitted of killing Kate Steinle, which has sparked a lot of reactions. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are criticizing San Francisco's sanctuary city policies. There's a call to boycott the city and support building the border wall. The city, however, is standing firm on its policies, arguing they improve public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police.

I should note that Garcia Zarate had been deported multiple times before and was released by San Francisco despite federal requests. The trial details are important too: he was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm but acquitted of murder. The defense argued that the gun went off accidentally.

Also, the political angle is significant. Trump used this case during his campaign to push for stricter immigration laws. The article mentions that Garcia Zarate had no violent crime record, which is a point in his defense.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements: the verdict, reactions from Trump and Sessions, the city's response, the trial details, and the broader implications of sanctuary cities. I should structure it to flow logically, starting with the verdict, then the reactions, the city's stance, and the trial specifics.

Let me check if I'm missing anything. The article also mentions that San Francisco has a long history of sanctuary policies and that many other cities have similar ones. This context is important to show why this case is symbolic.

I think I have all the main points. Now, I'll condense them into a clear, concise summary.

SUMMARY: A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle in San Francisco, sparking backlash against the city's sanctuary policies. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized the verdict, with Trump calling it a "travesty of justice" and demanding the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. San Francisco officials defended their sanctuary city policy, which they say improves public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released by San Francisco despite federal requests for detention. The jury convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm but acquitted him of murder, as his defense argued the gun discharged accidentally. Trump and others used the case to push for stricter immigration laws. San Francisco, a pioneer of sanctuary policies, remains committed to its inclusive approach. END OF SUMMARY.
