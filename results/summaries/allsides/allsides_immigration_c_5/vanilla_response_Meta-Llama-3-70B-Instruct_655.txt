SUMMARY:

A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in 2015. The verdict sparked outrage, with President Donald Trump calling it a "complete travesty of justice" and demanding cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. City officials vowed to stand behind their "sanctuary city" policy, which allows immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco's jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. The acquittal led to calls for a boycott of San Francisco and demands for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. City officials and state Sen. Scott Wiener defended the sanctuary policy, saying it improves public safety. Garcia Zarate was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and will likely be deported.
