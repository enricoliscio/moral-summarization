Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The summary has to be under 200 words, start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the aftermath of a jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in San Francisco, which has sparked reactions from Trump, Sessions, and others calling for a boycott of the city because of its sanctuary city policy. The article discusses the moral implications, with supporters of sanctuary cities arguing they improve public safety by encouraging cooperation with police, while critics argue they protect criminals.

I need to capture the key elements: the verdict, the reactions from Trump and Sessions, the #BoycottSanFrancisco hashtag, the city's defense of its sanctuary policy, the context of Garcia Zarate's past deportations and the circumstances of Kate Steinle's death, and the broader debate on immigration policies.

I should also highlight the moral arguments on both sides: the city's stance on sanctuary policies promoting safety versus the criticism that such policies shield dangerous individuals. It's important to mention that the judge excluded immigration politics from the trial and the differing views on whether the verdict was a travesty or a fair outcome.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and maintains the moral framing without taking sides. I'll structure it by first stating the verdict and reactions, then the city's response, followed by the context of the case, and conclude with the broader implications and reactions.

I should avoid including too much detail about the trial specifics, keeping it focused on the moral debate surrounding sanctuary cities and immigration policies. Also, I'll make sure to mention the political implications, such as Trump's call for a border wall and the historical context of San Francisco's sanctuary policy.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to hit all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY: A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle in San Francisco, sparking backlash against the city's sanctuary policies. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized the verdict, with Trump calling it a "travesty of justice" and demanding the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Some Twitter users boycotted the city, while conservative figures criticized its safety record. San Francisco defended its sanctuary policy, arguing it improves public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released despite federal requests to detain him. The trial focused on whether he intended to kill Steinle, with jurors rejecting murder charges but convicting him of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Critics, including Trump, used the case to argue for stricter immigration laws, while supporters of sanctuary cities emphasized the need to protect vulnerable communities. The verdict reignited debates over immigration policies and public safety, highlighting the moral and political tensions surrounding sanctuary cities. END OF SUMMARY.
