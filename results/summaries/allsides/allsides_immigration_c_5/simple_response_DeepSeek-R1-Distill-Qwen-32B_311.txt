Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave. Let me start by reading through the article carefully to understand the main points and the moral perspectives presented.

The article is about the aftermath of a jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in the death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco. The verdict led to a lot of backlash against San Francisco's sanctuary city policies. President Trump and others called for a boycott and criticized the city, while San Francisco defended its policies as promoting public safety and protecting immigrants. There's also a discussion about the border wall and the broader debate on immigration policies.

I need to capture the key events: the acquittal, the reactions from Trump and others, the city's defense of their sanctuary policies, the historical context of San Francisco being a sanctuary city, and the legal aspects of the case. Also, the moral framing includes the debate over immigration policies, public safety, and justice.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: the verdict, the reactions, the city's stance, the historical background, and the implications of the case. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all essential elements.

Let me outline the main points:

1. Jury acquits Garcia Zarate in Steinle's death.
2. Backlash against San Francisco's sanctuary policies.
3. Trump and others call for boycott and stricter immigration laws.
4. City defends policies as promoting public safety and protecting immigrants.
5. Historical context of San Francisco as a sanctuary city.
6. Legal details: Garcia Zarate's convictions, release, and the trial outcome.

Now, I'll need to weave these points together, making sure to highlight the moral arguments from both sides. The author presents the city's perspective as positive (protecting immigrants, public safety) and the opposing view as negative (using the case to demonize immigrants, push for stricter laws and a border wall).

I should ensure the summary reflects this balance, showing both the criticism and the defense of the sanctuary policy. Also, include the family's reaction and the legal outcome regarding Garcia Zarate's sentence.

I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure it's concise and captures all these elements without exceeding 200 words.

The summary must encapsulate the key events and moral perspectives from the article, highlighting the acquittal, reactions, and the debate over sanctuary policies. Here's the structured summary:
