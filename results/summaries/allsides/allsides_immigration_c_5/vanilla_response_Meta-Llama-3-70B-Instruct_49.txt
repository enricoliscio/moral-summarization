SUMMARY:

A jury in San Francisco acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a popular pier in 2015. The verdict sparked outrage, with President Donald Trump calling it a "complete travesty of justice" and demanding that cities like San Francisco scrap their "sanctuary city" policies. The policies bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts, allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco's jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. City officials vowed to stand behind their "sanctuary city" policy, which they believe improves public safety. The verdict has reignited debate over immigration policies, with Trump and others calling for a boycott of San Francisco and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
