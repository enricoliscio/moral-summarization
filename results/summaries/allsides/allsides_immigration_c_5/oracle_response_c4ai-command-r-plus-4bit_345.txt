SUMMARY: San Francisco faces backlash and calls for boycott after a jury acquitted a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, of killing Kate Steinle. President Trump and others criticized the verdict, with Trump calling it a "travesty of justice" and promoting his border wall agenda. The case has reignited debates about sanctuary city policies, with San Francisco officials defending their stance. Steinle's death in 2015 sparked national attention during the 2016 presidential campaign, with critics using it as an example of the need for tighter immigration laws. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from jail despite a federal request for detention. The trial focused on the circumstances of the shooting, with the defense arguing the gun fired accidentally. Garcia Zarate was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, but many feel justice was not served for Steinle's death. The verdict has led to renewed discussions about immigration policies and the role of sanctuary cities. The city's stance is that sanctuary policies improve public safety and protect immigrants from demonization and slander. The case highlights the complex moral and political issues surrounding immigration and public safety.
