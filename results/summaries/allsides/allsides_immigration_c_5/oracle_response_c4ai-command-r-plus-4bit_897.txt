SUMMARY: A jury acquitted a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, of killing a woman, Kate Steinle, on a San Francisco pier, sparking attacks on the city's immigration policies. President Trump and others called the verdict a travesty and used the case to demonize immigrants and slander them as criminals. San Francisco, a sanctuary city, released Garcia Zarate from jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation, as he had been deported five times before. The case has reignited debates about immigration laws and the building of a border wall. City officials defend their sanctuary city policy, arguing it improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The prosecutor sought a first-degree murder conviction, but jurors rejected murder and involuntary manslaughter charges, convicting Garcia Zarate of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The case has brought attention to the city's long-standing immigrant-friendly policies and its role as a safe place for religious and gender minorities and non-English speakers. Critics, including Trump and conservative figures, have used the case to suggest all immigrants are criminals and to call for stricter immigration laws and border control. Steinle's family expressed shock and sadness at the verdict, feeling that justice was not served.
END OF SUMMARY.
