SUMMARY: A jury acquitted Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing a woman in San Francisco, leading to backlash against the city's immigration policies. President Trump and others criticized the verdict and called for a boycott of the city, while city officials defended their "sanctuary city" policy. The case has reignited debates about immigration and public safety, with some using the tragedy to demonize immigrants and call for stricter border control. Despite the criticism, San Francisco remains committed to its sanctuary city status, which aims to improve public safety and protect immigrants. The prosecutor's argument for first-degree murder was rejected by the jury, and Garcia Zarate was only convicted of possessing a firearm. The case highlights the complex ethical and legal issues surrounding immigration and public safety in the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
