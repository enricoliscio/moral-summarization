SUMMARY:

A jury in San Francisco acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a popular pier in 2015. The verdict sparked outrage, with President Donald Trump calling it a "complete travesty of justice" and demanding cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. City officials vowed to stand behind their "sanctuary city" policy, which they argue improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth, was released from San Francisco's jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. He was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and will likely be deported. The verdict has reignited debate over immigration policies and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
