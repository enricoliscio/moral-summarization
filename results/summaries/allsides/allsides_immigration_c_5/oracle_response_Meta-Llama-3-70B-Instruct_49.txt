SUMMARY:

A jury's acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing a woman on a popular pier in San Francisco has sparked outrage, with President Donald Trump calling the verdict a "complete travesty of justice." Trump and others have used the case to demonize immigrants and push for stricter immigration laws. However, city officials and advocates argue that sanctuary policies improve public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. They claim that the verdict is being used to slander immigrants, suggesting they are all criminals, which is not true. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco's jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation, leading to the fatal shooting. Trump has tweeted that the verdict is "disgraceful" and that the "Kate Steinle killer" came back to commit crimes and be violent. However, Garcia Zarate's convictions were immigration and drug-related, with no record of violence. The case has reignited the debate over sanctuary cities and immigration policies. END OF SUMMARY.
