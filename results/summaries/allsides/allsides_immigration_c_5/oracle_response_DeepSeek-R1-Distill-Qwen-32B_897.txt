Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's use of specific words. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the key points.

The article discusses the aftermath of a jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. The verdict sparked reactions, including calls to boycott the city and demands to scrap its sanctuary policies. President Trump and others criticized the verdict as a travesty, linking it to immigration policies. The city defended its sanctuary status, emphasizing public safety through cooperation with law enforcement. The trial details showed conflicting arguments about the gun's handling, leading to a conviction for firearm possession. The family expressed disappointment, feeling justice wasn't served.

Now, I need to craft a concise summary (under 200 words) using as many of the provided moral terms as possible. I'll focus on the main events, reactions, and the moral implications highlighted. I'll ensure terms like "travesty," "released," "shot," "improve," "demonize," etc., are included where appropriate.

I'll structure the summary to cover the verdict, the reactions (boycott, Trump's comments), the city's stance, the trial details, and the family's response. I'll make sure each paragraph flows logically and includes the necessary moral framing words without making it too verbose.

Let me check the word count as I draft to stay within limits. I'll also ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the moral perspective presented.

SUMMARY:  
The jury's acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in the killing of Kate Steinle sparked outrage, with some calling for a boycott of San Francisco and demanding the removal of its sanctuary city policies. President Trump labeled the verdict a "travesty of justice," while Attorney General Jeff Sessions urged cities to scrap policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. The city, however, vowed to continue its sanctuary policy, which it claims improves public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. Critics, including conservative politicians and celebrities, lambasted the city as unsafe and accused it of demonizing immigrants by suggesting they are all criminals.  

Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco's jail despite federal requests for detention. The trial revealed conflicting arguments: the prosecution accused him of intending to kill Steinle, while his defense claimed the gun fired accidentally. Jurors rejected murder charges but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Steinle's family expressed shock and disappointment, feeling justice was not served.  

The case has been used to argue for stricter immigration laws and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, with critics suggesting immigrants are inherently violent. San Francisco, a pioneer in sanctuary policies, remains committed to protecting vulnerable populations, despite the controversy surrounding the verdict. END OF SUMMARY.
