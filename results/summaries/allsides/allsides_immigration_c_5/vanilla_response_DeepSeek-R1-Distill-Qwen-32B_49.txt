Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the aftermath of a court case in San Francisco involving Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who was acquitted of murdering Kate Steinle. The main points seem to be the reactions from different groups, the sanctuary city policy, and the political implications.

First, the jury acquitted Zarate, which led to calls for a boycott of San Francisco and demands for a border wall. Trump and Sessions criticized the city's immigration policies. On the other hand, city officials defended their sanctuary city stance, arguing it improves public safety. The article also mentions the history of San Francisco's sanctuary policies and how they help immigrants cooperate with police without fear.

I should include the key details: the acquittal, the reactions from Trump and others, the city's response, the specifics of the case (Zarate's history, the trial outcome), and the broader context of sanctuary cities. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without getting too bogged down in specifics.

Let me structure it: start with the acquittal and the resulting backlash, then the city's defense of their policies, the trial details, and the political implications. I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, mention that Zarate was convicted of a lesser charge and will likely be deported.

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll condense this into a coherent summary, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit.

SUMMARY: A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle, sparking backlash against San Francisco's sanctuary city policy. Critics, including President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, called for the city to abandon its immigration policies. Supporters argue the policies enhance public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with authorities. Zarate, who had been deported multiple times, was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm but acquitted of murder. The case has reignited debates over immigration laws and sanctuary cities, with some accusing the city of prioritizing immigrants over public safety. San Francisco remains committed to its sanctuary policy, which it implemented in 1989. The trial highlighted tensions between local and federal immigration enforcement, with federal officials seeking to deport Zarate despite local authorities releasing him. The verdict has drawn national attention, with some using it to criticize immigration policies and others defending sanctuary cities. END OF SUMMARY.
