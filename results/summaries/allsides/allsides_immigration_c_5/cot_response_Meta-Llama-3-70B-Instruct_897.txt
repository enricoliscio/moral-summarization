SUMMARY:
The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man who fatally shot Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in 2015, has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice" and demanded that cities like San Francisco scrap their "sanctuary city" policies, which bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. Trump and others have used Steinle's death to demonize immigrants and push for a border wall. However, city officials and state Sen. Scott Wiener argue that sanctuary policies improve public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The verdict has been met with sadness and shock by Steinle's family, who feel that "justice was rendered, but it was not served." END OF SUMMARY.
