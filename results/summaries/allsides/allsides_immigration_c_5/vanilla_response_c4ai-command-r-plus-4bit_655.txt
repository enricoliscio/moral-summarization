SUMMARY: San Francisco and other cities with similar immigration policies have come under fire following the acquittal of a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, for the killing of Kate Steinle on a popular pier. President Trump and other conservatives have used the verdict to criticize sanctuary city policies and call for stricter immigration laws. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded that cities like San Francisco end their sanctuary policies, while Twitter users called for a boycott of the city and the construction of a border wall. Despite the criticism, San Francisco officials vowed to uphold their sanctuary city policy, arguing that it improves public safety by encouraging cooperation between immigrants and police. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times and had a criminal record, was released from San Francisco's jail weeks before the shooting despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. The prosecutor argued that Garcia Zarate intended to kill Steinle, but the jury convicted him only of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The verdict has reignited debates about immigration policies and border security.
END OF SUMMARY.
