SUMMARY: San Francisco is facing criticism and calls for boycott after a jury acquitted a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, of killing Kate Steinle, a woman shot on a popular pier. President Trump and others have condemned the verdict as a travesty of justice, with Trump calling for the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The city's "sanctuary city" policy, which bars cooperation with federal deportation efforts, has been blamed for Zarate's release from jail despite his previous deportations and immigration violations. City officials defend their policy, arguing it improves public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The trial was closely watched during the 2016 presidential campaign, with then-candidate Trump pointing to Steinle's death as a reason to tighten immigration laws. The prosecution argued for first-degree murder, while the defense claimed the shooting was accidental. Zarate was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and will likely be removed from the country. Steinle's family expressed shock and sadness at the verdict, feeling that justice was not served.
END OF SUMMARY.
