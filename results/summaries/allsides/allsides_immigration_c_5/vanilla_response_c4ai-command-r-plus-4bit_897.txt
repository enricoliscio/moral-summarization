SUMMARY: A Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was acquitted of killing a woman, Kate Steinle, on a San Francisco pier, sparking intense backlash and debate over the city's immigration policies. President Trump and others criticized the verdict and called for a boycott of the city, known for its "sanctuary city" policy that protects immigrants. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded cities like San Francisco change their policies, while Twitter users used hashtags to promote Trump's proposed border wall. San Francisco officials defended their stance, arguing that sanctuary policies improve public safety. The case attracted national attention during the 2016 presidential campaign, with Trump pointing to Steinle's death as a reason to tighten immigration laws. Despite Garcia Zarate's immigration and drug-related convictions, the prosecutor failed to convince the jury of his intent to kill Steinle, resulting in a conviction for felon in possession of a firearm. The verdict highlighted the divide between those who support sanctuary cities and those who believe they endanger public safety. Steinle's family expressed their shock and disappointment with the outcome.
END OF SUMMARY.
