SUMMARY:

A jury in San Francisco acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a popular pier in 2015. The verdict sparked outrage, with President Donald Trump calling it a "complete travesty of justice" and demanding that cities like San Francisco scrap their "sanctuary city" policies. Twitter users called for a boycott of the city, and conservative politicians and celebrities criticized San Francisco as unsafe. City officials, however, vowed to stand behind their policy, which they argue improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. He was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and will likely be deported after serving his sentence.

END OF SUMMARY.
