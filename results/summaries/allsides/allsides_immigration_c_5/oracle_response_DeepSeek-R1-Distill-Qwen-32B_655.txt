Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user wants a concise summary under 200 words, using as many of the specified morally charged words as possible. Let me start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the reaction to a jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. The acquittal led to calls for a boycott and criticism from Trump and Sessions. The city defended its sanctuary policy, emphasizing public safety. Garcia Zarate had a history of deportations and was released despite federal requests. The trial's outcome sparked debates about immigration policies and public safety.

I should include words like "travesty," "released," "shot," "improve," "continue," "use," "demonize," "slander," "suggesting," "help," "hurt," "possession," "remove," "death," "came," "protected," "crimes," "violent," "used," "exoneration," "convictions," "violence," "living," "reentry," "detain," "deportation," "shooting," "violation," "conviction," "overreached," "kill," "striking," "served."

I'll structure the summary to highlight the key events and the moral arguments from both sides. Start with the acquittal and the reactions, then explain the sanctuary city policy, the case details, and the broader implications. Make sure to include the moral terms to reflect the author's framing.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes the necessary moral language. I'll check the word count and adjust if needed.

SUMMARY:  
The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man accused of killing Kate Steinle in San Francisco, sparked outrage and calls for a #BoycottSanFrancisco, with critics labeling the verdict a "travesty of justice." President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions condemned the city's sanctuary policy, which allowed Zarate's release despite federal deportation requests. San Francisco defended its policy, arguing it improves public safety by fostering immigrant cooperation with police. Critics, including conservative figures, demonized the city as unsafe and slandered immigrants, suggesting they are criminals. Zarate, with a history of deportations, was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Trump used the case to push for stricter immigration laws and a border wall, while Steinle's family expressed shock at the outcome. The trial highlighted tensions between immigration policies and public safety, with some arguing the prosecution overreached in seeking first-degree murder charges. The case remains a symbol of debates over sanctuary cities, immigration, and justice. END OF SUMMARY.
