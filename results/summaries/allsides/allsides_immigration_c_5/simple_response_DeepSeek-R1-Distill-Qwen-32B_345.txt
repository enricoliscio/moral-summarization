Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. The user is a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, so I have to make sure I capture the key points and the ethical implications involved.

First, I'll read through the article to get a sense of what's happening. The main event is the jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle. The acquittal led to a lot of backlash against San Francisco's sanctuary city policies. President Trump and others criticized the city, calling for a boycott and building the border wall. The article also explains the sanctuary city policy, its benefits, and the context of the case.

I need to highlight the moral arguments from both sides. On one side, supporters of sanctuary cities argue that these policies improve public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. On the other side, critics like Trump and Sessions argue that such policies protect dangerous criminals and undermine justice.

I should mention the key points: the acquittal, the reactions from Trump and Sessions, the hashtag campaigns, the city's response, the history of sanctuary policies, and the legal details of the case. I also need to include the family's reaction and the legal overreach in the prosecution.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, around 200 words, and ends with the specified tokens. I'll structure it by starting with the acquittal, then the reactions, the moral arguments, the legal aspects, and the family's response. I'll keep each point brief but informative, ensuring the moral framing is clear.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all these elements without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Also, I'll ensure that the moral perspectives from both sides are represented accurately.

SUMMARY: A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle in San Francisco, sparking outrage and calls to boycott the city over its sanctuary city policy. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized the verdict, with Trump calling it a "travesty of justice" and demanding stricter immigration laws. Twitter users promoted hashtags like #BoycottSanFrancisco and #kateswall, while conservative figures accused the city of being unsafe. San Francisco officials defended their sanctuary policy, emphasizing its role in fostering public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. The city, a pioneer in sanctuary laws since 1989, prides itself on protecting vulnerable communities. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released by San Francisco jail despite federal requests for detention. The jury convicted him only of being a felon in possession of a firearm, rejecting murder charges. Critics, including Steinleâ€™s family, expressed shock at the verdict, while supporters of sanctuary policies argued against demonizing immigrants. The case highlights the tension between immigration policies and public safety, with both sides presenting moral arguments about justice and protection. END OF SUMMARY.
