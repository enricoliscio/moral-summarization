SUMMARY: 
A jury's acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing a woman on a popular pier in San Francisco has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice," and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. The city's "sanctuary city" policy, which allows immigrants to cooperate with police without fear, was blamed for the release of Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth. Trump and others have used the tragedy to "demonize" and "slander" immigrants, suggesting they are all criminals. However, state Sen. Scott Wiener argued that sanctuary policies "improve public safety" and help people in the country illegally. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration laws and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. END OF SUMMARY.
