SUMMARY:

The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man accused of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier, has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice," while U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. The city's "sanctuary city" policy, which led to Garcia Zarate's release from jail despite a federal request to detain him, has been criticized for prioritizing immigrant safety over public safety. Trump and others have used Steinle's death to demonize immigrants and push for stricter immigration laws. However, city officials and advocates argue that sanctuary policies improve public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The verdict has sparked a heated debate over immigration policies and the role of sanctuary cities in the U.S. END OF SUMMARY.
