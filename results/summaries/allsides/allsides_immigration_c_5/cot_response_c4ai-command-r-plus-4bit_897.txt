SUMMARY:
San Francisco has faced backlash and calls for boycott after a jury acquitted a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, of killing a woman, Kate Steinle, despite his history of immigration violations and deportations. President Trump and other conservative figures strongly criticized the verdict, with Trump calling it a "travesty of justice" and advocating for the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The city officials, however, stood firm in defending their "sanctuary city" policy, which aims to provide a safe haven for immigrants, religious and gender minorities, and non-English speakers. The policy has drawn criticism for allegedly allowing criminals to go free, with some calling for a boycott of the city and lambasting it as unsafe. Despite the backlash, supporters of the sanctuary city policy argue that it improves public safety by encouraging cooperation between immigrants and law enforcement. The trial's prosecutor faced criticism for seeking a first-degree murder conviction, with some suggesting a second-degree murder conviction would have been more appropriate given the evidence. Steinle's family expressed their disappointment and shock at the verdict, feeling that justice was not served. The case has reignited debates around immigration policies and the morality of protecting vulnerable populations while also ensuring public safety.
