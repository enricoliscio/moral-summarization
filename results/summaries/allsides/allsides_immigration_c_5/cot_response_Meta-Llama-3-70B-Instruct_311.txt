SUMMARY:
The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man who fatally shot Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier, has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice" and demanded cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. City officials vowed to stand behind their "sanctuary city" policy, which they argue improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Critics, including Trump, have used the tragedy to "demonize" and "slander" immigrants, suggesting they are all criminals. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with Trump calling for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The Steinle family expressed shock and sadness at the verdict, saying "justice was rendered, but it was not served."
