Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the trial of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, the killing of Kate Steinle, and the debate over sanctuary cities. The user provided a list of morally charged words that need to be included in the summary. 

First, I need to read through the article carefully to understand the key points. The main events are the jury acquitting Garcia Zarate of murder, the reactions from Trump and Sessions, the #BoycottSanFrancisco hashtag, and the city's stance on being a sanctuary city. 

I should identify the morally framed words used by the author and ensure they are included in the summary. Words like "travesty," "released," "shot," "improve," "continue," "use," "demonize," "slander," "suggesting," "help," "hurt," "possession," "remove," "death," "came," "protected," "crimes," "violent," "used," "exoneration," "convictions," "violence," "living," "reentry," "detain," "deportation," "shooting," "violation," "conviction," "overreached," "kill," "striking," "served."

I need to structure the summary to cover the trial outcome, the reactions from both sides, the city's policy, and the broader implications. I'll start with the jury's decision, then Trump's and Sessions' reactions, followed by the city's defense of their sanctuary policy. I'll mention the hashtag and the family's response. I should also touch on the debate over sanctuary cities and the legal arguments presented.

I have to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll avoid adding any new moral framing beyond what's in the article and stick to the facts while preserving the author's tone.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral words are included. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Once done, I'll present it after the "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of first-degree murder in the 2015 death of Kate Steinle, sparking outrage and calls to #BoycottSanFrancisco. President Trump called the verdict a "travesty of justice," while Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded cities like San Francisco revoke sanctuary policies that prevent cooperation with federal deportation efforts. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco’s jail despite federal requests for detention. The city defended its sanctuary policy, arguing it improves public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. Critics, including conservative politicians and celebrities, lambasted the city as unsafe. San Francisco’s mayor vowed to maintain its sanctuary status, which dates back to 1989. The trial highlighted the debate over immigration policies and public safety, with Garcia Zarate ultimately convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Steinle’s family expressed shock, stating justice was rendered but not served. The case has been used to demonize immigrants and slander their character, with some suggesting all immigrants are criminals. The verdict has reignited the debate over sanctuary cities and immigration enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
