SUMMARY:

The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man who fatally shot Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in 2015, has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have criticized San Francisco's "sanctuary city" policy, which they claim led to Garcia Zarate's release from jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. City officials, however, argue that the policy improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with Trump calling for the construction of a border wall. Meanwhile, state Sen. Scott Wiener has condemned the demonization of immigrants, emphasizing that they are not all criminals. The case has become a symbol of the nation's divisive immigration politics.
