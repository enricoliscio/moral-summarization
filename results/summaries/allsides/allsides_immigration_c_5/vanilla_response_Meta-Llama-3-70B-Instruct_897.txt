SUMMARY:

A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in 2015. The verdict sparked outrage, with President Donald Trump calling it a "complete travesty of justice" and demanding that cities like San Francisco scrap their "sanctuary city" policies. Trump and others have used Steinle's death to advocate for stricter immigration laws and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. San Francisco officials, however, vowed to stand behind their policy, which they argue improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco's jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. He was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and will likely be deported.

END OF SUMMARY.
