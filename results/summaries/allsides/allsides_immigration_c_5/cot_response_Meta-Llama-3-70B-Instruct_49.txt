SUMMARY:
The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a popular pier in San Francisco has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice" and demanded cities like San Francisco scrap their "sanctuary city" policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. Conservative politicians and celebrities lambasted the city as "unsafe" and "weakly protected". In contrast, city officials and state Sen. Scott Wiener defended the policy, arguing it improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with Trump calling for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The Steinle family expressed shock and sadness over the verdict, saying "justice was rendered, but it was not served". END OF SUMMARY.
