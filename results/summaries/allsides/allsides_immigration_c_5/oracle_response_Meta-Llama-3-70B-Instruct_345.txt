SUMMARY:

A jury's acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing a woman on a popular pier in San Francisco has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice," and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. The city's "sanctuary city" policy, which allows immigrants to cooperate with police without fear, has been criticized for releasing Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth, back into the community. State Sen. Scott Wiener argued that such policies "improve public safety" and do not "demonize immigrants" or "slander" them by suggesting they are all criminals. Trump, however, tweeted that the verdict was "disgraceful" and that Garcia Zarate's "exoneration is a complete travesty of justice." The case has reignited debate over immigration laws and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
