Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about San Francisco's sanctuary city policies and the aftermath of a murder case involving Jose Ines Garcia Zarate. They also included specific instructions on how to approach the task: first, identify morally framed words, and then write a concise summary.

First, I'll tackle STEP 1, identifying the single words with moral framing. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry a strong moral connotation. Words like "travesty," "justice," "boycott," "slander," "demonize," "refuge," "violence," "exoneration," "weakly," "overreached," "shocked," "saddened," and "justice" stand out. Each of these words carries a moral weight, either positive or negative, and is crucial for the summary.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into 200 words or less while including as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll start by outlining the key events: the jury acquittal, the reactions from Trump and Sessions, the #BoycottSanFrancisco hashtag, the sanctuary city policy, the trial details, and the political implications. I'll make sure to include the moral words to reflect the author's framing, such as the travesty of justice, the demonization of immigrants, and the call for a border wall.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the acquittal, the reactions, the policy details, the trial outcome, and the broader implications. I'll also highlight the opposing viewpoints: the city's stance on sanctuary policies improving public safety versus the criticism from Trump and others. It's important to mention the family's reaction and the legal overreach in the trial to maintain the moral context.

I should also keep the summary concise, avoiding unnecessary details while covering all critical points. I'll make sure each sentence contributes to the overall narrative and includes the necessary moral terms. Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's under 200 words and that it accurately reflects the article's moral framing.

**STEP 1:**  
* travesty  
* justice  
* boycott  
* slander  
* demonize  
* refuge  
* violence

* weakly  
* overreached  
* shocked  
* saddened  
* justice  

**SUMMARY:**  
The acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man accused of killing Kate Steinle, sparked outrage and calls for a #BoycottSanFrancisco, with critics blaming the city's sanctuary policy. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions condemned the verdict as a "travesty of justice," demanding cities like San Francisco end policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Supporters of sanctuary cities, including San Francisco officials, argue such policies improve public safety by encouraging immigrants to work with police without fear. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco jail despite federal requests for detention. The jury acquitted him of murder, convicting him only of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Critics, including Trump, used the case to push for stricter immigration laws and a border wall, while supporters of sanctuary policies defended the city's commitment to protecting immigrants. The verdict left Steinle's family "saddened and shocked," feeling justice was not served. END OF SUMMARY.
