Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the trial of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who was acquitted of killing Kate Steinle, and the reactions to the verdict, especially focusing on San Francisco's sanctuary city policies.

The author uses several morally charged words like "travesty," "released," "shot," "improve," etc. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary. I should highlight the conflict between the sanctuary city policies and federal immigration efforts, as well as the public reactions, including the call to boycott San Francisco.

I'll start by stating the verdict and the reactions from Trump and Sessions. Then, mention the hashtags and the city's response. I'll include the points about sanctuary cities improving public safety and the criticism that immigrants are being demonized. It's important to note the trial details, like the jury rejecting murder charges but convicting on a firearm possession charge.

I should also touch on the historical context of San Francisco's sanctuary policies and the political implications, especially with Trump's campaign points. Finally, I'll mention the family's reaction to the verdict not serving justice.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows logically while preserving the moral framing. I'll make sure to include key events and the opposing viewpoints to present a balanced yet morally charged summary.

SUMMARY: After a jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle, reactions ranged from calls to #BoycottSanFrancisco to support for the city's sanctuary policies. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized the verdict, calling it a "travesty of justice" and demanding cities like San Francisco end policies that limit cooperation with federal deportation efforts. Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times, was released from San Francisco's jail despite federal requests for detention. The city defended its sanctuary policy, arguing it improves public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police. Critics, including conservative figures, demonized the city as unsafe and suggested immigrants are criminals. The trial focused on whether Garcia Zarate intended to kill Steinle, but jurors rejected murder charges, convicting him only of being a felon in possession of a firearm. San Francisco, a pioneer in sanctuary policies since 1989, remains committed to protecting immigrants, despite federal efforts to remove Garcia Zarate. The verdict has reignited debates over immigration laws and public safety, with Steinle's family expressing shock that justice was not served. END OF SUMMARY.
