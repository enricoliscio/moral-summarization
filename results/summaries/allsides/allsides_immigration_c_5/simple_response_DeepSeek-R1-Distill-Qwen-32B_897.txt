Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first to understand what's going on.

The article is about the reaction in San Francisco after a jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle. There's a lot of political and moral arguments here. The main points seem to be about sanctuary cities, immigration policies, and the reactions from different groups.

The author seems to present both sides. On one hand, there's the criticism from Trump, Sessions, and others who blame San Francisco's sanctuary city policy for letting Zarate go, leading to Steinle's death. They want to boycott the city and build the border wall. On the other hand, supporters of sanctuary cities argue that these policies improve public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police, and they criticize the other side for demonizing immigrants.

I need to capture this moral framing. The summary should highlight the conflict between those who see sanctuary cities as unsafe and those who see them as safe and just. Also, it's important to mention the trial outcome and the political implications.

I should start by stating the verdict and the reactions. Then, mention the calls to boycott and the support from the city. Include the points from both sides, maybe a sentence each. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and balanced.

Wait, the user also mentioned to preserve the moral framing. So I should make sure that the summary reflects the moral arguments presented, like justice, safety, and immigration policies.

Let me structure it: verdict, reactions from Trump and others, the city's response, the moral arguments on both sides, and the trial details briefly.

I think that's a good approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes the key moral points.

SUMMARY: A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle, sparking outrage and calls to boycott San Francisco over its sanctuary city policy. President Trump and others criticized the verdict as a "travesty of justice," demanding stricter immigration policies and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Supporters of sanctuary cities, like San Francisco, argue they improve public safety by fostering trust between immigrants and police. The city remains committed to its policy, despite criticism. The trial highlighted conflicting narratives: prosecutors accused Zarate of intent, while his defense claimed accidental discharge of a gun. The jury convicted him only of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Critics, including Steinle's family, felt justice was not served, while supporters of sanctuary policies condemned the demonization of immigrants. END OF SUMMARY.
