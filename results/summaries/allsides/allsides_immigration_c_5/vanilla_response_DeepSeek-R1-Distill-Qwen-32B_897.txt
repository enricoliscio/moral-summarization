Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article is about the aftermath of a jury acquitting Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle in San Francisco. The verdict led to a lot of backlash, with people calling for a boycott of the city and supporting the construction of a border wall. President Trump and Jeff Sessions criticized San Francisco's sanctuary city policies. The city, however, defended its stance, stating that sanctuary policies help improve public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The trial details are mentioned, including the jury's rejection of murder charges but convicting him of being a felon in possession of a firearm. There's also background on how Garcia Zarate was released despite federal requests to deport him. The article also touches on the political implications, with Trump using this case to push for stricter immigration laws and building a border wall. The Steinle family feels justice wasn't served.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key elements: the verdict, the reactions from Trump and Sessions, the sanctuary city defense, the trial outcome, and the political implications. I should make sure to mention that the jury acquitted him of murder but convicted him of a firearm offense, and that San Francisco remains committed to its sanctuary policy. Also, note that the verdict sparked calls for a border wall and boycotts. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the verdict, the reactions, the city's response, the trial details, and the political fallout.

Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's concise. I need to avoid unnecessary details and keep it clear and to the point. Make sure to include all the essential points without going into too much depth on any single aspect. That should cover the main aspects of the article effectively.
