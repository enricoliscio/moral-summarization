SUMMARY:
A jury's acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier has sparked outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Donald Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice" and demanded cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. The city's "sanctuary city" policy, which allows immigrants to cooperate with police without fear, was blamed for Garcia Zarate's release from jail despite a federal request to detain him for deportation. Conservative politicians and celebrities lambasted the city as "unsafe" and Trump tweeted that the verdict was "disgraceful" and that Garcia Zarate was "violent". City officials vowed to stand behind their policy, saying it improves public safety. The verdict has reignited the debate over immigration policies and the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
