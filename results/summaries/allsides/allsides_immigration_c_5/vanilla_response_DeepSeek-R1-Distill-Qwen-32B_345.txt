Okay, I need to summarize this news article about the San Francisco sanctuary city policy and the recent trial involving Jose Ines Garcia Zarate. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that attacks on San Francisco and other sanctuary cities began after a jury acquitted a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, of killing Kate Steinle. There's a call for a boycott, with hashtags like #BoycottSanFrancisco and #kateswall. President Trump and Jeff Sessions are criticizing the city's immigration policies. 

San Francisco's sanctuary city policy is a key point. It allowed Garcia Zarate to be released despite federal requests for deportation. He had been deported five times before. The city's officials, including Mayor Ed Lee's spokeswoman, stand by their policy, arguing it improves public safety by encouraging immigrants to cooperate with police.

The trial details: Garcia Zarate was charged with first-degree murder but acquitted. The defense said the gun fired accidentally. He was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. ICE plans to deport him. 

The article also mentions the political backdrop, with Trump using this case during his campaign to push for stricter immigration laws and a border wall. Steinle's family feels justice wasn't served.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key elements: the trial outcome, the sanctuary city policy, the reactions from Trump and others, the city's defense of the policy, and the political implications.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the jury's acquittal leading to backlash. Mention Trump's criticism and the #Boycott hashtag. Explain the sanctuary city policy and why Garcia Zarate was released. Highlight the trial outcome and the city's stance. Conclude with the political impact and Steinle's family's reaction.

I should ensure the summary is concise, includes all main points, and stays within the word limit. Avoid unnecessary details, like the specifics of the trial evidence unless crucial.

Now, putting it all together in a clear, concise manner.
