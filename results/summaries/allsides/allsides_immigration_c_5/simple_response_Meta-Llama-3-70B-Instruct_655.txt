SUMMARY:

A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in 2015, sparking outrage and calls for a boycott of the city. President Trump and Attorney General Sessions criticized the verdict, demanding cities like San Francisco scrap immigration policies that bar cooperation with federal deportation efforts. Conservative politicians and celebrities lambasted the city as unsafe, while city officials vowed to stand behind their "sanctuary city" policy. The policy, which allows immigrants to cooperate with police without fear, has been in place since 1989 and is intended to help Central American refugees. Despite the acquittal, Garcia Zarate will likely be deported after serving a three-year sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The case has reignited the debate over immigration policies and the role of sanctuary cities in the US.
