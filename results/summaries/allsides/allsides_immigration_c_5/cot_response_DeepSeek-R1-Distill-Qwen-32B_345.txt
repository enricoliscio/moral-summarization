Okay, I need to tackle this user's query. They provided a news article and asked for a summary that preserves the moral framing. They also want me to first identify the morally framed single words. Let me start by understanding the article.

The article is about the San Francisco sanctuary city policy and the aftermath of a murder case involving Jose Ines Garcia Zarate. There's a lot of political tension here, with Trump and Sessions criticizing the city, and others defending sanctuary policies.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. I'll go through the article and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "travesty," "boycott," "slander," "demonize," "weakly," "disgraceful," "exoneration," "reckless," "justice," "safeguarding," "harshly," "exonerated," "condemned," "vilified," "protection," "safeguard," "defended," "pride," "exoneration," "tragedy," "innocent," "fairness," "equity," "discrimination," "violence," "safeguard," "protection," "exoneration," "demonize," "slander," "weakly," "disgraceful," "exoneration," "reckless," "justice," "safeguarding," "harshly," "exonerated," "condemned," "vilified," "protection," "safeguard," "defended," "pride," "exoneration," "tragedy," "innocent," "fairness," "equity," "discrimination," "violence," "safeguard," "protection," "exoneration."

Next, I need to write a concise summary, under 200 words, incorporating as many of these words as possible. The summary should capture the conflict between sanctuary cities and federal immigration policies, the trial outcome, and the reactions from both sides.

I'll start by mentioning the jury's acquittal, the calls for a boycott, Trump's and Sessions' reactions. Then, I'll note the city's defense of sanctuary policies, the trial details, the judge's decision, and the political implications. I'll end with the family's reaction and the ongoing debate.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and includes the moral terms without making it too long. I should check the word count to stay within the limit. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring all key points are covered and the moral framing is preserved.

**SUMMARY:**  

A jury acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate of killing Kate Steinle in San Francisco, sparking outrage and calls for a #BoycottSanFrancisco. President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized the city’s sanctuary policy, which allowed Zarate’s release despite federal deportation requests. Conservative figures accused the city of being unsafe and demonized immigrants, while San Francisco officials defended their policy as safeguarding public safety and protecting vulnerable communities. The trial revealed conflicting accounts of the shooting, with jurors rejecting murder charges but convicting Zarate of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Critics argued the prosecution overreached, while Steinle’s family expressed shock and sadness, feeling justice was not served. The case has become a political battleground, with debates over immigration policies, public safety, and fairness.
