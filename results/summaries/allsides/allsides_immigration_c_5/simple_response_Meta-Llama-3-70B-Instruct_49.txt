SUMMARY:

A jury in San Francisco acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a Mexican man, of killing Kate Steinle on a popular pier in 2015. The verdict sparked outrage from President Donald Trump and conservative politicians, who blamed the city's "sanctuary city" policy for the tragedy. Trump called the verdict a "complete travesty of justice" and demanded cities like San Francisco scrap their immigration policies. However, city officials and state Sen. Scott Wiener defended the policy, arguing that it improves public safety by allowing immigrants to cooperate with police without fear. The case has reignited the debate over immigration policies, with Trump and others using Steinle's death to push for stricter laws and a border wall. Meanwhile, Garcia Zarate's attorneys argued that he found a gun on the pier and it fired accidentally, and he will likely be deported after serving his sentence.
