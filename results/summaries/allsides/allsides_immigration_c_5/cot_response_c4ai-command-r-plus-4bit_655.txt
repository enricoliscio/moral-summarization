SUMMARY:
San Francisco and other cities with similar immigration policies faced attacks and calls for boycotts after a jury acquitted a Mexican man, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, of killing a woman, Kate Steinle, on a popular pier. President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions strongly criticized the verdict and San Francisco's "sanctuary city" policy, which bars cooperation with federal deportation efforts. City officials, however, defended their stance, arguing that sanctuary policies improve public safety by fostering trust between immigrants and police. Despite strong evidence, the jury rejected charges of murder and involuntary manslaughter, convicting Garcia Zarate only of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The case ignited debates about immigration and sanctuary cities during the 2016 presidential campaign, with Trump using it as a rallying cry for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. Steinle's family expressed shock and disappointment at the verdict, feeling that justice was not served. The incident highlighted the complex moral and political issues surrounding immigration and sanctuary policies in the United States.
