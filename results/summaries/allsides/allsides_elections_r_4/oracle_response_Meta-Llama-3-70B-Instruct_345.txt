SUMMARY:

At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This rejection of democratic norms is consistent with his behavior throughout the campaign. He has disrespected the Constitution, promised to violate its essential rules, and dismissed core principles like free speech. He has encouraged violent acts against protesters and repeatedly declared the election is rigged, raising the specter of imaginary voter fraud. Trump has also praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, Saddam, and Assad, and expressed admiration for their strength. He has promised to implement unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. His lack of respect for democracy and the Constitution is matched only by his praise for authoritarian dictators. Trump's authoritarian outlook is inseparable from his vast personal vanity, and it's clear he's running to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
