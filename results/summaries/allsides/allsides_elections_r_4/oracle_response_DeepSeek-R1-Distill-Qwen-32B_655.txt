Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too longâ€”no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's refusal to accept election results and his disregard for democratic norms. The author uses strong moral language to criticize Trump's actions and beliefs. 

I should start by highlighting Trump's refusal to accept the election outcome. Then, mention his history of rejecting democratic norms, like when he didn't support the GOP nominee. The article also talks about his past statements questioning the legitimacy of elections, calling them a "sham" and "travesty." 

Next, I need to cover his encouragement of violence, like at his rallies, and his claims of a rigged election. The summary should include his disrespect for the Constitution, such as dismissing free speech and promising undemocratic policies. 

Also, his admiration for authoritarian leaders like Putin and his authoritarian policies in the U.S. are key points. Finally, his vanity and belief in his own superiority, which ties into his desire for unchecked power.

I'll structure the summary to flow from his refusal to accept the election, through his history of rejecting norms, his hostile actions, disrespect for the Constitution, admiration for dictators, and his authoritarian ambitions. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words like "refused," "rejection," "sham," "travesty," "disrespect," "hostility," "encouraged," "declare," "disrespected," "promised," "violate," "derided," "lack," "praise," "admiration," "hack," "side," "implement," "banning," "closing," "retaliating," "solve," "running," "unchecked," "unaccountable."

I need to keep each sentence concise and include the most impactful points without going over the word limit. Let me draft a summary that hits all these points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The GOP presidential nominee refused to accept the election results, horrifying his opponent and signaling his rejection of democratic norms. From the start, Trump has disrespected the legitimacy of democracy, calling past elections a "sham" and "travesty." He has encouraged violence at rallies, declared the election rigged, and dismissed the Constitution, promising to violate its principles. Trump has praised authoritarian leaders like Putin and suggested unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against critics. His disregard for democratic peace, acceptance, and respect for the electoral process is matched by his admiration for dictators. Trump's authoritarian outlook, combined with his vanity and belief in his own superiority, suggests he seeks unchecked, unaccountable power, not the presidency of a democratic republic. END OF SUMMARY.
