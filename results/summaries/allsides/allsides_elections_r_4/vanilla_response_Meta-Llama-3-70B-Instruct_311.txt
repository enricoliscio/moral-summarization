SUMMARY:

The GOP presidential nominee, Donald Trump, refused to say he would accept the election results during the final presidential debate, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is not surprising, as Trump has consistently shown disdain for democratic norms and the electoral process throughout his campaign. He has encouraged violence against protesters, claimed the election is rigged, and promised to violate the Constitution's essential rules. Trump has also praised authoritarian leaders, such as Vladimir Putin, and expressed admiration for their strength. He has proposed unconstitutional policies, including banning Muslims and retaliating against critical media outlets. Trump's behavior suggests he is not interested in being the president of a democratic republic, but rather an unchecked and unaccountable leader. His vast personal vanity and authoritarian outlook are inseparable, leading to the conclusion that he is running to undermine democracy, not uphold it.

END OF SUMMARY.
