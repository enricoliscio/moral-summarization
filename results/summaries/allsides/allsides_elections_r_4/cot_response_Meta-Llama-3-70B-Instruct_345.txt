SUMMARY:
At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is a horrifying display of his disdain for democratic norms. Throughout his campaign, Trump has consistently disrespected the Constitution and promised to violate its essential rules. He has praised authoritarian leaders and expressed admiration for their strength. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his praise for authoritarian dictators. He has repeatedly promised to implement unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. Trump's eternal winner mentality and vast personal vanity are inseparable from his authoritarian outlook. It's clear that Trump is not running to be the president of a democratic republic, but to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of constitutionally limited democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
