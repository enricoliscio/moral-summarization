SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, stating he would "keep [us] in suspense." This is consistent with Trump's history of disregarding democratic norms and the legitimacy of democracy. He has encouraged violence at his rallies, claimed the election is rigged, and disrespected the Constitution by promising to violate its rules. Trump has praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and expressed admiration for their authoritarian tendencies. He has also proposed implementing authoritarian policies in the US, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. Trump's vanity and authoritarian outlook are intertwined, as he perceives himself as an eternal winner who cannot accept loss. His behavior indicates that he seeks to be an unchecked leader, unbound by the democratic principles of the US. 

END OF SUMMARY.
