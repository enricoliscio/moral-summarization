SUMMARY:
Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results is horrifying but not surprising, given his history of rejecting democratic norms and the legitimacy of democracy. He has consistently disrespected the Constitution, praised authoritarian dictators, and expressed admiration for their authoritarian tendencies. Trump has also encouraged supporters to engage in violent acts, dismissed free speech, and promised to violate constitutional rules. His vanity is inseparable from his authoritarian outlook, and he perceives himself as an eternal winner, refusing to accept any loss as his own fault. Trump's actions and statements suggest he is running to become the unchecked and unaccountable leader of a democratic republic, free from the shackles of constitutionally limited democracy he clearly despises. END OF SUMMARY.
