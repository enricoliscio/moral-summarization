SUMMARY:

At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This rejection of democratic norms is no surprise, given his consistent disdain for democracy's legitimacy. Throughout his campaign, Trump has disrespected the Constitution, promised to violate its essential rules, and encouraged violent acts against protesters. He has repeatedly declared the election rigged, raising the specter of imaginary voter fraud. Trump has praised authoritarian dictators, such as Putin, and expressed admiration for their strength. He has promised to implement unconstitutional policies, like banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. His lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his praise for authoritarian leaders. Trump's desire to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader is evident in his repeated claims that "only I can solve" the country's problems. His refusal to accept democratic norms is a rejection of the very principles of democracy.
