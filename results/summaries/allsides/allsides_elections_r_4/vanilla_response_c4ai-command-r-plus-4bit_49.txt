SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, stating he would "keep [us] in suspense." This stance aligns with his past disregard for democratic norms, as seen in his refusal to support the eventual GOP nominee and his encouragement of violent acts at his rallies. Trump has also consistently disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its provisions and praising authoritarian dictators like Vladimir Putin. He has expressed admiration for their authoritarian tendencies and has proposed implementing similar policies in the US, such as banning Muslims and closing down mosques. Trump's vanity and perception of himself as an eternal winner contribute to his authoritarian outlook. His campaign has been characterized by a rejection of democratic norms, a disdain for the Constitution, and a desire for unchecked power. Trump's actions and statements suggest he is seeking to become the unaccountable leader of a democratic republic, unbound by the limitations imposed by the Constitution.
END OF SUMMARY.
