SUMMARY:

The GOP presidential nominee, Donald Trump, refused to say he would honor and accept the results of the election during the final presidential debate, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is not surprising, as Trump has consistently shown disdain for democratic norms and the legitimacy of the electoral process throughout his campaign. He has encouraged violence against protesters, claimed the election is rigged, and promised to violate the Constitution's essential rules. Trump has also praised authoritarian leaders, such as Vladimir Putin, and expressed admiration for their strength. He has proposed authoritarian and unconstitutional policies, including banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. Trump's refusal to accept the election results is part of a larger pattern of rejecting democratic norms and seeking unchecked power.

END OF SUMMARY.
