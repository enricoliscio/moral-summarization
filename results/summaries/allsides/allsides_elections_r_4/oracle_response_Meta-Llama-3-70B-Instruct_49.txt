SUMMARY:

At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This rejection of democratic norms is consistent with his behavior throughout the campaign. He has disrespected the Constitution, promised to violate its essential rules, and dismissed core principles like free speech. He has encouraged violent acts against protesters, declared the election rigged, and praised authoritarian leaders like Putin. Trump's lack of respect for democracy is matched only by his admiration for authoritarian strength. He has expressed his desire to implement unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. His personal vanity is inseparable from his authoritarian outlook, leading to the conclusion that Trump is running to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of democracy. His refusal to accept the election results is a warning that he will not respect the limits of presidential power.
