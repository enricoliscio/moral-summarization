SUMMARY: 

The GOP presidential nominee's refusal to accept the election results in the final debate is a horrifying but unsurprising move, given his consistent disregard for democratic norms and legitimacy. Throughout his career, Trump has shown disdain for the electoral process, encouraged violence against protesters, and promised to violate constitutional rules. He has dismissed the idea of free speech, promised to seize assets, and suggested forced registration of Muslims. Trump's praise for authoritarian leaders like Putin, Hussein, and Assad reveals his admiration for their strength and authoritarian tendencies. His desire to implement unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets, demonstrates his authoritarian outlook. Trump's vast personal vanity and perception of himself as an eternal winner lead him to blame others for losses and reject democratic norms. It is clear that Trump is not running to be the president of a democratic republic, but to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from constitutional limits.
