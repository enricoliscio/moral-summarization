SUMMARY:

The GOP presidential nominee, Donald Trump, refused to say he would accept the results of the election, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is not surprising, given his history of rejecting democratic norms. Trump has consistently disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its rules and disrespecting the electoral process. He has encouraged violence against protesters, claimed the election is rigged, and praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution is matched by his admiration for authoritarian dictators. He has expressed desires to implement unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. Trump's vast personal vanity is tied to his authoritarian outlook, and it appears he is running to be an unchecked leader, free from democratic constraints.

END OF SUMMARY.
