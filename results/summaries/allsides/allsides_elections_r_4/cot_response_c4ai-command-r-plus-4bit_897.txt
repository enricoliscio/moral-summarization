SUMMARY:
The final presidential debate of the 2016 US election revealed a horrifying truth about the GOP nominee, Donald Trump. Throughout his campaign, Trump has shown disdain for democratic norms and a rejection of the legitimacy of the electoral process. He has encouraged supporters to commit violent acts, dismissed concerns about voter fraud, and threatened riots if his nomination was not successful. Trump has also expressed his desire to violate the Constitution, disregarding free speech, promising war crimes, and deriding its principles as dismissively as an ill-informed suicide pact. Furthermore, he has praised authoritarian leaders and expressed admiration for their tendencies, while denouncing US democracy. Trump's authoritarian outlook and personal vanity are inseparable, as he perceives himself as an eternal winner, unaccountable to democratic limitations. His lack of respect for constitutional democracy and admiration for authoritarianism indicate that he seeks to become the unchecked leader of the nation, free from the shackles of democracy that he so clearly despises.
