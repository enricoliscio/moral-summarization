SUMMARY:

The GOP presidential nominee's refusal to accept the election results in the final debate is a horrifying but unsurprising display of his disdain for democratic norms. Throughout his campaign, Trump has consistently rejected the legitimacy of democracy, encouraging violence against protesters, claiming the election is rigged, and promising to violate the Constitution. He has derided core constitutional principles, praised authoritarian leaders, and expressed his desire to implement unconstitutional policies. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his admiration for authoritarian dictators. His authoritarian outlook is inseparable from his vast personal vanity, and it's clear that he's not running to be the president of a democratic republic, but to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader. Trump's actions are a threat to the very foundations of democracy, and his refusal to accept the election results is just the latest example of his contempt for the democratic process.

END OF SUMMARY.
