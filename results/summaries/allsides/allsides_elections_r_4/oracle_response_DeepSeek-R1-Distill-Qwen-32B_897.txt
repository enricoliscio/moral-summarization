Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user has provided a list of morally charged words that should be included in the summary. Let me read through the article again to understand the main points.

The article discusses Trump's refusal to accept the election results, his disdain for democratic norms, and his authoritarian tendencies. It mentions his past statements about the election being a sham, his encouragement of violence, and his admiration for dictators. The author uses strong moral language to criticize Trump's actions and beliefs.

I need to make sure the summary includes as many of those morally framed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll start by identifying the key events and Trump's actions. Then, I'll incorporate the listed words where appropriate.

First, the refusal to accept the election results is a central point. I'll mention his refusal and the rejection of democratic norms. Next, his history of discrediting the electoral process, like calling the 2012 election a sham. Then, his encouragement of violence and declared support for authoritarian leaders.

I should also touch on his promises to violate constitutional rules, such as seizing assets and banning Muslims. His disregard for the Constitution and his belief in his own authority are important points. Finally, his authoritarian outlook and the conclusion that he's not running for a democratic republic but for unchecked power.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows naturally while including the moral terms. Let me structure it step by step, making sure each paragraph covers a main point and uses the appropriate language.

Now, I'll draft the summary, checking each sentence to include the necessary moral framing words. I'll make sure not to add any new information beyond what's in the article and maintain the critical tone the author used.

SUMMARY: The GOP presidential nominee, Donald Trump, refused to accept the legitimacy of the election process during the final debate, stating he would "keep you in suspense." This behavior aligns with his consistent rejection of democratic norms, as seen in his 2012 claim that the election was a "total sham" and his repeated declarations that the election is rigged. Trump has disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its rules, such as seizing assets and banning Muslims. He has also encouraged violence against protesters and praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin. Trump's authoritarian outlook is evident in his belief that only he can solve the nation's problems, positioning himself as an unchecked and unaccountable leader rather than a democratic president. His disregard for democratic principles and his admiration for authoritarian regimes underscore his disdain for constitutional democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
