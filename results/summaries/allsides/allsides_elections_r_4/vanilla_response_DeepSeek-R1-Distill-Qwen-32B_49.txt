Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through it first. The article is about Trump's behavior during the final presidential debate, where he didn't commit to accepting the election results. It goes on to detail his history of disrespecting democratic norms and the Constitution. 

Hmm, I need to make sure I capture the main points. First, his refusal to accept election results. Then, his history of not supporting the GOP nominee, his tweets about the 2012 election being a sham, and his claims of voter fraud. 

Also, his authoritarian tendencies, praising dictators like Putin, and his unconstitutional policies like banning Muslims. Plus, his personal vanity and belief in his own authority. 

I should structure the summary to highlight these key points concisely. Keep it under 200 words. Make sure it flows logically, starting from the debate, then his past actions, authoritarian leanings, and his personality traits. 

Need to avoid any markdown and just use plain text. Also, the summary should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should double-check the word count to stay within the limit. 

Let me draft it, making sure each sentence covers a main point without getting too detailed. That should cover all the essential aspects of the article.

SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, GOP nominee Trump refused to commit to honoring the election results, a move criticized as a rejection of democratic norms. His disregard for democratic principles dates back to his refusal to support the eventual GOP nominee in the 2016 primaries and his 2012 claim that Obama's election was a "sham." Throughout his campaign, Trump has repeatedly accused the election system of being rigged, encouraged violence against protesters, and praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Assad. He has also proposed unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against critical media. Trump's belief in his own authority over democratic processes and his personal vanity further highlight his authoritarian tendencies. His actions suggest he seeks unchecked power rather than adhering to constitutional democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
