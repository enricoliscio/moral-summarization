SUMMARY:
Trump's horrifying disregard for democratic norms and the Constitution has been evident throughout his public career and presidential campaign. He has consistently rejected the legitimacy of the electoral process, exhibiting hostility towards democratic norms such as peace, acceptance, and respect for free speech and constitutional limits on presidential power. Trump has encouraged violence at his rallies, threatened riots if he didn't secure the GOP nomination, and disrespected the Constitution by promising to violate its rules. His disdain for democracy is matched by his adulation of authoritarian dictators like Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Muammar Gaddafi. Trump's unchecked desires for unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques, indicate his aspiration to become an unaccountable leader, free from the constraints of democracy. Trump's vanity and perception as an eternal winner further fuel his authoritarian outlook, as he refuses to accept any loss as his own fault. His dismissive attitude towards democratic institutions and his admiration for authoritarian strength are a dangerous combination.
END OF SUMMARY.
