SUMMARY:

In the final presidential debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump refused to say he would accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is not surprising, given his consistent rejection of democratic norms and legitimacy throughout his public career. Trump has shown disdain for the Constitution, promising to violate its essential rules, and has praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin. He has encouraged violence against protesters, claimed the election is rigged, and promised to implement unconstitutional policies. Trump's lack of respect for democracy is matched by his admiration for authoritarian strength. His personal vanity and authoritarian outlook suggest he is not running to be president of a democratic republic, but rather an unchecked and unaccountable leader.

END OF SUMMARY.
