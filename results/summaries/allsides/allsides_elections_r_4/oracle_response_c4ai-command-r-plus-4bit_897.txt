SUMMARY: At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the outcome of the election, a continuation of his rejection of democratic norms and legitimacy. Trump's career has been marked by a disregard for democratic peace, acceptance, and respect, instead encouraging violence and hostility. He has disrespected the Constitution, dismissing free speech and promising to violate its rules. Trump admires authoritarian dictators and has expressed desire to implement unconstitutional policies. His vanity and authoritarian outlook are inseparable, as he perceives himself as an eternal winner, running to be an unchecked leader. This horrifying stance should come as no surprise, as Trump has consistently rejected democratic values and principles.

END OF SUMMARY.
