SUMMARY:
At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is a horrifying display of his disdain for democratic norms. Throughout his campaign, Trump has shown hostility towards the electoral process, disrespecting the Constitution and promising to violate its essential rules. He has derided core constitutional principles and praised authoritarian dictators, expressing admiration for their strength. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his authoritarian tendencies. He has repeatedly expressed his desire to implement unconstitutional policies, banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. His vast personal vanity is inseparable from his authoritarian outlook, and it is clear that Trump is not running for president of a democratic republic, but to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of constitutionally limited democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
