SUMMARY:

At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This rejection of democratic norms is horrifying and consistent with his past behavior. Throughout his campaign, Trump has disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its essential rules, and has praised authoritarian dictators. He has encouraged violent acts against protesters, declared the election is rigged, and dismissed the idea of free speech. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his admiration for authoritarian leaders. He has repeatedly expressed his desire to implement unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and closing down mosques. Trump's vast personal vanity is inseparable from his authoritarian outlook, leading to the conclusion that he is not running to be the president of a democratic republic, but rather its unchecked and unaccountable leader.

END OF SUMMARY.
