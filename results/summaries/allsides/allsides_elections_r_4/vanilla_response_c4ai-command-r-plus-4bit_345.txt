SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, stating he would "keep [us] in suspense." This is consistent with Trump's history of disregarding democratic norms and the legitimacy of democratic processes. He has a track record of disrespecting the Constitution, praising authoritarian leaders, and expressing a desire to implement authoritarian policies in the US. Trump has also repeatedly disrespected the norms of democracy, encouraged violence at his rallies, and promoted the idea of a rigged election with baseless claims of voter fraud. His rejection of democratic principles is coupled with a disdain for free speech and a willingness to violate constitutional rules. Trump's authoritarian outlook is fueled by his personal vanity, as he perceives himself as an eternal winner, unable to accept loss. This leads to the conclusion that Trump seeks to become an unchecked leader, unbound by the constraints of democratic principles and constitutional limits.
END OF SUMMARY.
