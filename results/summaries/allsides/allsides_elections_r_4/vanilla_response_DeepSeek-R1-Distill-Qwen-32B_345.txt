Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Trump's behavior during the final presidential debate. The user provided the article and an example of a summary, so I should follow that structure.

First, I'll read the article to understand the main points. It talks about Trump refusing to commit to accepting the election results, which is concerning because it shows he doesn't respect democratic norms. The article mentions past instances where he questioned the legitimacy of elections, like in 2012 when he called Obama's win a sham. It also points out his authoritarian tendencies, praising leaders like Putin and suggesting unconstitutional policies like banning Muslims or closing mosques. Additionally, Trump's vanity and belief in his own infallibility are highlighted, as he thinks only he can solve the country's problems.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should start with the refusal to accept election results, then mention his history of doubting democracy, his authoritarian leanings, and his personal vanity. I'll make sure to include key points like the Emmy comment and his admiration for dictators.

Let me structure it: Begin with the debate incident, then his past actions, his authoritarian policies, and conclude with his self-perception. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay within the word limit. Also, I need to make sure the summary flows logically and covers all main themes without getting too detailed.

I should avoid jargon and keep it straightforward. Maybe start with "At the final presidential debate..." then move through his history, authoritarian tendencies, and end with his personality traits. I need to ensure each sentence adds value and doesn't repeat information unnecessarily.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll make sure each paragraph is tight and each sentence conveys a clear point. I'll also ensure that the summary starts with the "SUMMARY:" token and ends with "END OF SUMMARY." as per the instructions.

I think that's a solid plan. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: At the final presidential debate, Donald Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, raising concerns about his respect for democratic norms. Throughout his campaign, Trump has consistently shown disdain for democratic principles, such as questioning the legitimacy of elections, encouraging violence at rallies, and promoting authoritarian policies like banning Muslims or closing mosques. He has also praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin, suggesting he admires their strongman tactics. Trump's behavior reflects a disregard for constitutional limits and a belief in his own infallibility, as seen in his claims that only he can solve the nation's problems. His refusal to accept the possibility of defeat, combined with his authoritarian tendencies, suggests he seeks unchecked power rather than adhering to democratic principles. END OF SUMMARY.
