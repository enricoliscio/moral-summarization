Alright, so I need to summarize this article about Trump's behavior and his disregard for democratic norms. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning the final presidential debate where Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, which is concerning because it shows he doesn't respect democratic norms. It goes back to his initial refusal to support the GOP nominee in the primary debates, which was a red flag. Then, it talks about his history of doubting the legitimacy of elections, like his tweets in 2012 calling the election a sham. He's been consistent in his disdain for democratic norms throughout his campaign, even encouraging violence at rallies.

The article also points out his authoritarian tendencies, like praising dictators such as Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Assad. Trump has proposed unconstitutional policies, like banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against media critics. He believes only in his own whims and doesn't understand the Constitution. His narcissism is tied to his authoritarian views, as he sees himself as the only one who can fix the country. The conclusion is that he's not running for president but for an unchecked leadership role, despising the democratic system.

Now, I need to condense all this into a concise summary, under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: refusal to accept election results, history of doubting democracy, authoritarian behavior, proposed unconstitutional policies, admiration for dictators, and his narcissistic view of leadership.

I should make sure to mention each of these points briefly but clearly. Let me structure it in a logical flow, starting with the debate, then his history, authoritarian actions, policies, and finally his overall stance against democracy.

I also need to use the "SUMMARY:" token at the beginning and "END OF SUMMARY." at the end. Let me put it all together, keeping each sentence tight and focused on the main ideas without extra details.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Donald Trump's consistent disregard for democratic norms and his authoritarian tendencies. During the final presidential debate, Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, echoing his long-standing skepticism of democratic processes. This pattern began in the 2012 Republican primary, where he questioned the legitimacy of the eventual nominee. Trump has repeatedly claimed the election is rigged, dismissed voter fraud concerns as baseless, and praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Assad. He has proposed unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against critical media. Trump's narcissism and belief in his own infallibility further underscore his disdain for democratic constraints, suggesting he seeks unchecked power rather than leading a democratic republic. END OF SUMMARY.
