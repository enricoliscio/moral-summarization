SUMMARY: In the final presidential debate, the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, refused to commit to accepting the election results, demonstrating his disregard for democratic norms and the legitimacy of the electoral process. This attitude has been consistent throughout his public career, as he has rejected the norms of democracy, encouraged violence at his rallies, and claimed the election is rigged. Trump has disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its rules and expressing admiration for authoritarian leaders. He has dismissed core constitutional principles, praised foreign dictators, and expressed a desire to implement authoritarian policies in the US. Trump's vanity and authoritarian outlook are intertwined, and his campaign has been characterized by a lack of respect for democratic values and institutions. His actions and statements indicate that he seeks to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader, rather than the president of a democratic republic bound by constitutional limits.
