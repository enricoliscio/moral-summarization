SUMMARY:
At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is a horrifying display of his disdain for democratic norms. Throughout his campaign, Trump has shown hostility towards the electoral process, encouraging violent acts against protesters and claiming the election is rigged. He has disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its essential rules and praising authoritarian leaders like Putin. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his admiration for authoritarian strength. He has expressed his desire to implement unconstitutional policies, revealing his eternal vanity and inseperable authoritarian outlook. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Trump is not running for president of a democratic republic, but to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of constitutionally limited democracy he so clearly despises. END OF SUMMARY.
