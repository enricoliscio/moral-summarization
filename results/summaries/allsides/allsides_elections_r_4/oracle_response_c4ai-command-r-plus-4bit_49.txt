SUMMARY: In the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, sparking horror but not surprise. His rejection of democratic norms and legitimacy has been consistent, refusing to support the Republican nominee and treating democratic norms with hostility. Trump has disrespected the Constitution, derided its principles, and praised authoritarian dictators. He has expressed admiration for Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Gaddafi, dismissing concerns about Russia's hack of democratic emails. Trump has promised to violate the Constitution, seize assets, and order war crimes, while implementing authoritarian policies targeting Muslims and the media. His vanity and authoritarian outlook are inseparable, perceiving himself as an eternal winner. Trump's campaign indicates he is running to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the constraints of democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
