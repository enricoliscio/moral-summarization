SUMMARY:
At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is a horrifying display of his disdain for democratic norms. Throughout his campaign, Trump has shown hostility towards the electoral process, disrespecting the Constitution and promising to violate its essential rules. He has dismissed the idea of free speech and derided core constitutional principles. Trump's praise for authoritarian dictators like Putin, Hussan, Gaddagi, and al-Assad is fulsome, and he has expressed his desire to implement authoritarian, unconstitutional policies in the U.S. His vast personal vanity is inseparable from his authoritarian outlook, and it's clear that Trump is not running for president of a democratic republic, but to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of constitutionally limited democracy he so clearly despises. END OF SUMMARY.
