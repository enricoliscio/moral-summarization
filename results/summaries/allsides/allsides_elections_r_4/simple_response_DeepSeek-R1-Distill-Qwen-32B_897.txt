Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The article is about Trump's behavior during the final presidential debate and his disregard for democratic norms. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points. The article talks about Trump refusing to commit to accepting the election results, which the author finds horrifying. It also mentions his past actions, like his tweets in 2012 about the election being a sham, and his encouragement of violence at rallies. Additionally, Trump has praised authoritarian leaders and proposed unconstitutional policies.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points concisely. The moral framing is clear: Trump's actions are a threat to democracy and the Constitution. I should highlight his consistent disregard for democratic norms, his authoritarian tendencies, and the implications for the country.

I'll start by mentioning his refusal to accept election results. Then, I'll touch on his past behavior, his admiration for dictators, and his unconstitutional policies. Finally, I'll conclude with the implication that he wants unchecked power, which is a moral concern.

I should keep the summary under 200 words, so I need to be concise but thorough. I'll structure it to flow logically from his recent actions to his past behavior and then to the broader implications.

Let me draft the summary now, making sure to include all key points and maintain the moral perspective. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct.

He has also encouraged violence at rallies, praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, and proposed unconstitutional policies such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. Trump's behavior suggests he views himself as an "eternal winner" and believes only he can solve the nation's problems, dismissing constitutional limits and democratic principles. His actions and rhetoric reveal a desire for unchecked power, threatening the democratic foundations of the United States. END OF SUMMARY.
