SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, stating he would "keep [people] in suspense." This reflects his consistent rejection of democratic norms and legitimacy. Trump has a history of disrespecting the Constitution, promising to violate its rules, and deriding its principles. He has encouraged supporters to engage in violent acts and has expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders. Trump has also dismissed the idea of free speech and has threatened to seize assets and force Muslims into a federal database. He has promised to commit war crimes and implement authoritarian policies. His vanity and authoritarian outlook are inseparable, as he perceives himself as an eternal winner, unwilling to accept loss. Trump's campaign has been characterized by hostility towards democratic norms, and he appears to be running to become an unchecked leader, free from the constraints of democracy. His lack of respect for democratic principles and his praise for authoritarianism indicate a dangerous disregard for the foundations of the United States' political system.
END OF SUMMARY.
