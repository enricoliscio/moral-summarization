SUMMARY: In the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to commit to accepting the election results, which is horrifying and indicative of his disregard for democratic norms. This is consistent with his past behavior, such as his refusal to support the eventual Republican nominee and his encouragement of violent acts at his rallies. Trump has disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its rules and expressing admiration for authoritarian leaders. He has dismissed core constitutional principles and threatened to seize assets and restrict the freedom of speech and religion for certain groups. Trump's vanity and authoritarian outlook are clear in his belief that only he can solve the country's problems and that any loss is someone else's fault. His behavior indicates that he seeks to be an unchecked leader, free from the constraints of democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
