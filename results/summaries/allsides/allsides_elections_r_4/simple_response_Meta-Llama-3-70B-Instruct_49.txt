SUMMARY:

The GOP presidential nominee's refusal to accept the election results is a horrifying but unsurprising move, given his consistent rejection of democratic norms and legitimacy. Throughout his campaign, Trump has shown disdain for the Constitution, encouraging violence, claiming voter fraud, and promising to violate essential rules. He has dismissed free speech, suggested forced registration of Muslims, and promised to commit war crimes. Trump's praise for authoritarian leaders like Putin, Hussan, Gaddagi, and Assad reveals his admiration for their strength and his desire to implement similar policies in the US. His authoritarian outlook is inseparable from his vast personal vanity, leading him to perceive any loss as someone else's fault. Ultimately, Trump is not running to be the president of a democratic republic, but to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of constitutionally limited democracy.

END OF SUMMARY.
