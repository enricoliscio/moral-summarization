SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, the Republican nominee refused to commit to accepting the election results, instead choosing to "keep [the country] in suspense." This alarming statement is consistent with Trump's history of rejecting democratic norms and the legitimacy of democracy. He has previously refused to support the eventual Republican nominee and has expressed disdain for the norms of democracy, such as peace, acceptance, and respect for the electoral process. Trump has encouraged violence at his rallies, claimed the election is rigged, and threatened riots if his nomination was not secured. He has disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its rules and expressing admiration for authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Muammar Gaddafi. Trump has also dismissed core constitutional principles and expressed his desire to implement authoritarian policies in the US, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. His vanity and authoritarian outlook are intertwined, as he sees himself as an eternal winner, unwilling to accept any loss. Trump's campaign suggests he seeks to become the unchecked and unaccountable leader of the US, unbound by the constitutional democracy he so clearly despises.
END OF SUMMARY.
