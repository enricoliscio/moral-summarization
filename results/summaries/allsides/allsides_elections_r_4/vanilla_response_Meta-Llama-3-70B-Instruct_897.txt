SUMMARY:

In the final presidential debate, GOP nominee Trump refused to commit to honoring the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is consistent with his rejection of democratic norms throughout his campaign. Trump has repeatedly disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its essential rules, and has praised authoritarian leaders like Putin. He has encouraged violence against protesters, claimed the election is rigged, and promised to implement unconstitutional policies like banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution and democratic norms is matched only by his admiration for authoritarian dictators. His vast personal vanity and authoritarian outlook suggest he is not running to be president of a democratic republic, but rather its unchecked and unaccountable leader.

END OF SUMMARY.
