SUMMARY: The refusal of the GOP presidential nominee, Trump, to commit to accepting the results of the election is a clear indication of his disregard for democratic norms and the legitimacy of the electoral process. This attitude has been consistent throughout his public career, as he has treated the norms of democracy with disdain and encouraged violence at his rallies. Trump has also repeatedly disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its most essential rules, and expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders such as Putin, Hussein, and Assad. He has dismissed core constitutional principles and promised to implement authoritarian policies in the US, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. Trump's vanity and authoritarian outlook are inseparable, and he seems to be running to become an unchecked leader, free from the constraints of democracy. His rejection of democratic values and praise for authoritarianism indicate a dangerous disregard for the foundations of the American political system. END OF SUMMARY.
