SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, stating he would "keep [us] in suspense." This is consistent with his past behavior, as he refused to endorse the eventual Republican nominee during the primary debates and has a history of disrespecting democratic norms and the US Constitution. Trump has encouraged violence at his rallies, threatened to violate free speech, and promised to commit war crimes and unconstitutional acts as president. He admires authoritarian leaders and has dismissed concerns about Russian hacking, suggesting he prefers authoritarianism to democracy. Trump's vanity and self-perception as a winner make it difficult for him to accept any loss, leading to his belief that the system is "rigged" against him. His campaign has been characterized by a rejection of democratic principles and a desire for unchecked power, indicating he seeks to be an unaccountable leader, free from democratic constraints.
END OF SUMMARY.
