Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Donald Trump's behavior during the final presidential debate, where he refused to commit to accepting the election results. The author is critical of Trump, pointing out his consistent disregard for democratic norms. They mention his past actions, like doubting the legitimacy of Obama's election in 2012 and encouraging violence at his rallies. Trump's authoritarian tendencies are highlighted, along with his admiration for dictators like Putin and his plans for unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. The author argues that Trump's actions and statements show he doesn't respect the Constitution or democratic principles, instead seeking unchecked power.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include Trump's refusal to accept election results, his history of rejecting democratic norms, examples of his authoritarian behavior, and the conclusion that he aims for unchecked power. I need to maintain the moral stance that the author took, emphasizing the dangers of Trump's disregard for democracy.

I should structure the summary to first state Trump's refusal in the debate, then outline his past actions, and finally conclude with the implications of his authoritarian views. I'll make sure to include key examples like the 2012 election rant, encouragement of violence, and admiration for dictators. Also, mention his proposed unconstitutional policies to show his contempt for the Constitution.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to be concise but cover all the main points. I'll avoid going into too much detail on each point to stay within the limit. The summary should flow logically, starting from the debate, moving through past behavior, and ending with the conclusion about his goals.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, ensuring it's under 200 words and captures the moral framing.
