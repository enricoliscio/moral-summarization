Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The article is about Trump's refusal to accept the election results and his disregard for democratic norms. 

First, I need to understand the key points. The article starts with Trump not committing to accepting the election results, which is concerning. It goes back to his past behavior, like not supporting the GOP nominee in the primaries and his tweets about the 2012 election being a sham. 

I should highlight his consistent disregard for democratic norms, like encouraging violence, claiming voter fraud, and praising authoritarian leaders. Also, his authoritarian policies like banning Muslims and closing mosques are important. His vanity and belief in his own superiority are also key points.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the moral concerns without being too lengthy. I'll structure it to show his pattern of behavior and the implications for democracy.

I should start with his refusal to accept election results, then mention his history, his actions during the campaign, his admiration for dictators, and his authoritarian policies. Finally, conclude with his view of the presidency as a position without democratic constraints.

Let me make sure the summary flows well and each sentence adds a new point without repeating. I need to keep the language clear and direct, preserving the moral tone from the original article.

SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, GOP nominee Trump refused to commit to honoring the election results, a move that horrified his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This behavior aligns with Trump's consistent disregard for democratic norms and the legitimacy of the electoral process. From the outset, Trump has shown contempt for the principles of peace, acceptance, and respect for the electoral process. In the 2012 election, he claimed it was a "sham," and throughout his campaign, he has repeatedly accused the system of being rigged, encouraged violence against protesters, and praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Assad. Trump has also proposed unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against critical media. His belief in his own infallibility and his view of the presidency as an unchecked, unaccountable position further underscore his disdain for constitutional democracy. His actions and statements suggest he seeks to undermine democratic principles and establish authoritarian control. END OF SUMMARY.
