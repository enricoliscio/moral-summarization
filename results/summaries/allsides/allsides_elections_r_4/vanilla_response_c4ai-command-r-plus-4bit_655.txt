SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, stating he would "keep [the country] in suspense." This stance aligns with his previous actions and statements that demonstrate a lack of respect for democratic norms and the legitimacy of democracy. Trump has a history of disregarding the norms of democracy, encouraging violence at his rallies, and promoting conspiracy theories about voter fraud. He has also expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders and has consistently disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its provisions and core principles. Trump's vanity and authoritarian outlook are intertwined, and he perceives himself as an eternal winner, unwilling to accept any loss. His campaign has been characterized by a desire to implement authoritarian policies and a disregard for the limitations of presidential power. Trump's actions and statements indicate that he is seeking to become the unchecked leader of the United States, unbound by the constraints of constitutional democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
