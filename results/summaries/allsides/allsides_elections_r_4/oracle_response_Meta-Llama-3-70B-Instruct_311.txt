SUMMARY:

At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This rejection of democratic norms is consistent with his past behavior, where he refused to support the eventual nominee in the Republican primary debate. Trump has consistently disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its essential rules, and has derided core constitutional principles. He has praised authoritarian dictators, such as Vladimir Putin, and has expressed admiration for their strength. Trump's lack of respect for democracy is matched only by his desire to implement authoritarian policies in the US, including banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against media outlets. His refusal to accept the election results is a warning sign of his hostility towards democracy and his desire to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader. END OF SUMMARY.
