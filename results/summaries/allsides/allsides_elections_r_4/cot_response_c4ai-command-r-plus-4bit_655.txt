SUMMARY: In the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to commit to accepting the election results, which is horrifying and a warning sign of his rejection of democratic norms and the legitimacy of the electoral process. This is consistent with his previous statements and behavior, including his disdain for the Constitution and encouragement of violent acts at his rallies. Trump has disrespected democratic norms and the limits of presidential power, while admiring authoritarian dictators and their tendencies. He has dismissed core constitutional principles and promised to violate them with unconstitutional policies. Trump's vanity and authoritarian outlook are inseparable, and he perceives himself as an eternal winner, refusing to accept any loss as his fault. The article concludes that Trump seeks to become the unchecked and unaccountable leader of the United States, free from the constraints of democracy.
