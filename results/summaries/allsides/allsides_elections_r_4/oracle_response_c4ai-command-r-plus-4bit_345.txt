SUMMARY: At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the results of the election, stating he would "keep [the country] in suspense." This rejection of democratic norms is consistent with Trump's past behavior, including his refusal to support the eventual Republican nominee and his disparagement of the electoral process. Trump has also disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its rules and deriding its principles. He has expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders and has dismissed the idea of free speech, while encouraging supporters to engage in violent acts. He has declared his intention to implement authoritarian policies and has dismissed the notion of a fair election, claiming it is "rigged." Trump's vanity and authoritarian outlook are inseparable, as he perceives himself as an eternal winner, refusing to accept any loss. His campaign has been characterized by a lack of respect for democratic principles, peace, and acceptance, with a consistent disregard for the legitimacy of the electoral process. Trump is running to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the constraints of democracy.
END OF SUMMARY.
