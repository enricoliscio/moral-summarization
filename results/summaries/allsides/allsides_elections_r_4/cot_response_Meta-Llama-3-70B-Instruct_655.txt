SUMMARY:
At the final presidential debate, the GOP nominee refused to accept the election results, saying he would "keep you in suspense." This is a horrifying display of his disdain for democratic norms. Throughout his campaign, Trump has shown hostility towards the electoral process, encouraging violent acts against protesters and claiming the election is rigged. He has disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its essential rules and praising authoritarian dictators. Trump's lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his admiration for authoritarian leaders. He has expressed his desire to implement unconstitutional policies, banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. Trump's vast personal vanity is inseparable from his authoritarian outlook, and it's hard to avoid the conclusion that he is running to be an unchecked and unaccountable leader, free from the shackles of democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
