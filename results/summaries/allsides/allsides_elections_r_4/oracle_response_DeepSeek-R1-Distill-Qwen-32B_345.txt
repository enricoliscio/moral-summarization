Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user is acting as a news summarizer and a moral expert, so the summary needs to capture the essence of the article's moral perspective.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Trump's refusal to accept the election results and his disdain for democratic norms. The author uses strong moral language, so I need to include those words.

I'll start by noting the key events: the refusal to accept election results, the history of rejecting democratic norms, the Twitter rant in 2012, encouragement of violence, claims of a rigged election, admiration for authoritarian leaders, and authoritarian policies.

I should use the morally framed words provided, like "refused," "rejected," "sham," "travesty," "hostility," "encouraged," "acts," "disrespected," "promised," "violate," "derided," "lack," "praise," "hack," "implement," "unchecked," "unaccountable."

I need to structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the refusal, then his history, actions during the campaign, admiration for dictators, and the conclusion about his authoritarian aims.

I'll make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all the moral elements without losing the essence. Let me piece it together, ensuring each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: The article highlights Trump's consistent rejection of democratic norms and his disdain for the principles of peace, acceptance, and respect for the electoral process. He has repeatedly refused to accept the legitimacy of elections, dismissing them as "shams" and "travesties," and has encouraged supporters to engage in violent acts against protesters. Trump has also declared that the election is rigged, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and has disrespected the Constitution by promising to violate its essential rules, such as dismissing free speech and suggesting unconstitutional policies like banning Muslims and closing mosques. His admiration for authoritarian leaders like Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Assad further underscores his disregard for democratic principles. Trump's authoritarian outlook is evident in his desire to implement unchecked, unaccountable power, viewing himself as the sole solution to the nation's problems. His refusal to accept defeat and his personal vanity are inseparable from his authoritarian tendencies, leading to the conclusion that he seeks to become an unaccountable leader, free from the constraints of democracy. END OF SUMMARY.
