Okay, so I've got this query where the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've given specific instructions: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and then write a concise summary using those words.

First, I need to understand what "morally framed" means. It refers to words that carry a moral judgment, either positive or negative. In this context, since the article is critical of Trump, the words will likely be negative.

Looking at the article, I'll go through each paragraph and pick out words that express moral judgment. Words like "horrifying," "refused," "disdain," "hostility," "travesty," "sham," "rigged," "specter," "imaginary," "derided," "dismissive," "dictators," "authoritarian," "unconstitutional," "banning," "closing," "retaliating," "unchecked," "unaccountable," "shackles," "despises," "eternal winner," "vanity," "authoritarian," "unconstitutional," "banning," "closing," "retaliating," "unconstitutional," "unaccountable," "shackles," "despises," "eternal winner," "vanity."

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the article into 200 words, keeping as many of these moral words as possible. The main points are Trump's refusal to accept election results, his disdain for democratic norms, his authoritarian tendencies, and his admiration for dictators. I'll structure the summary to highlight these points, using the identified words to maintain the moral tone.

I'll start by mentioning the debate and his refusal, then touch on his past behavior, like the 2012 rant. Then discuss his campaign behavior, including the rigged claims and authoritarian policies. Finally, tie it all together to show his desire for unchecked power, contrasting with democratic norms.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll check each sentence to ensure it's concise and includes the necessary moral terms without being too verbose. Also, I'll ensure that the summary accurately reflects the article's critical stance towards Trump's actions and beliefs.

**SUMMARY:**  
At last night's final presidential debate, Donald Trump refused to commit to honoring the election results, a move described as horrifying. Throughout his campaign, Trump has consistently shown disdain for democratic norms, rejecting the legitimacy of the electoral process. He has repeatedly claimed the election is rigged, despite evidence of voter fraud being almost entirely imaginary. Trump has also dismissed core constitutional principles, such as free speech and the sanctity of the Constitution, instead promoting authoritarian policies like banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against media critics. His admiration for authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein further highlights his disdain for democratic governance. Trump's behavior, including his refusal to accept losses and his fixation on personal victory, suggests he seeks unchecked, unaccountable power, rejecting the constraints of constitutional democracy. His actions and rhetoric reveal a clear disrespect for democratic norms and a preference for authoritarianism.  
**END OF SUMMARY.**
