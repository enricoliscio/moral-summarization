SUMMARY:

The GOP presidential nominee's refusal to accept the election results in the final debate is a horrifying but unsurprising move, given his consistent rejection of democratic norms and legitimacy throughout his public career. He has disrespected the Constitution, promised to violate its essential rules, and praised authoritarian dictators. His lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his admiration for strong authoritarian leaders. He has expressed his desire to implement unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and retaliating against media outlets. His vast personal vanity is inseparable from his authoritarian outlook, leading to the conclusion that he is not running to be the president of a democratic republic, but to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader. His actions and words demonstrate a disdain for democracy and a desire for authoritarian power.
