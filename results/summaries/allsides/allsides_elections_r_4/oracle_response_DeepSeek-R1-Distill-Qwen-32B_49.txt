SUMMARY:  
The article highlights Donald Trump's consistent rejection of democratic norms and his disdain for the principles of peace, acceptance, and respect for the electoral process. Trump has repeatedly refused to accept the legitimacy of elections, declaring the 2016 election as "rigged" and dismissing the notion of a fair democratic process. His behavior, from his 2012 tweets calling the election a "total sham" to his encouragement of violence at rallies, demonstrates a clear hostility toward democratic principles. Trump has also disrespected the Constitution, promising to violate its essential rules, such as dismissing free speech and suggesting authoritarian policies like banning Muslims, closing mosques, and retaliating against critical media. His admiration for authoritarian leaders like Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Assad further underscores his disdain for democracy. Trump's refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of the electoral process, combined with his authoritarian tendencies, raises concerns about his commitment to constitutional democracy. His belief in his own unchecked power and his rejection of democratic norms make it clear that he seeks to be an unaccountable leader, not a president of a democratic republic.
