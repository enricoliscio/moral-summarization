Okay, I need to summarize this article about Trump's behavior and his disregard for democratic norms. Let me read through the article again to make sure I understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning the final presidential debate where Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results. That's a big point because it shows he doesn't respect the democratic process. The author compares this to his past behavior, like not supporting the GOP nominee in the primary debates.

Then, it goes back to 2012 when Trump claimed the election was a sham, showing he's been skeptical of democracy for a while. Throughout his campaign, he's been hostile towards democratic norms, encouraging violence at rallies and claiming the election is rigged. He's also praised authoritarian leaders like Putin and others, which is another red flag.

The article also points out his unconstitutional policies, like banning Muslims and closing mosques, and his personal vanity, thinking only he can solve problems. This all suggests he wants to be an unchecked leader, not a president in a democracy.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I should include his refusal to accept election results, his history of rejecting democratic norms, his encouragement of violence, the rigged election claims, admiration for dictators, and his authoritarian policies. Also, his personal vanity and desire for unchecked power are key points.

I'll structure it by starting with the debate incident, then his history, his actions during the campaign, his admiration for dictators, his policies, and conclude with his overall goal of being an unchecked leader.

Let me check the word count as I draft. I need to be concise but cover all main points without going over the limit. I'll make sure each sentence flows logically to the next, covering each key aspect of Trump's behavior and attitude towards democracy and authoritarianism.

SUMMARY: During the final presidential debate, Donald Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results, a move that horrified his opponent Hillary Clinton and highlighted his consistent disregard for democratic norms. Trump has long rejected the legitimacy of the electoral process, as seen in his 2012 claim that the election was a "sham" and his repeated assertions that the current election is "rigged." He has also encouraged violence at his rallies and praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin, Saddam Hussein, and Bashar al-Assad, while proposing unconstitutional policies such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. Trump's behavior reflects his disdain for constitutional principles and his desire to become an unchecked, authoritarian leader rather than a president of a democratic republic. END OF SUMMARY.
