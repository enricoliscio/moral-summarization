Alright, so I'm trying to help this user who wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article and specific instructions on how to process it. Let me break this down.

First, the user wants me to identify all the single words that are morally framed in the article. They mentioned this as Step 1, so I need to go through the text and pick out words that carry moral connotations. Words like "horrifying," "reject," "disdain," "hostility," etc., come to mind. I should list each of these words, each on a new line, prefixed with an asterisk.

Next, I need to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I should capture the essence of the article, which is about Trump's disregard for democratic norms, his authoritarian tendencies, and his contempt for the electoral process and the Constitution.

I should also ensure that the summary flows well and accurately reflects the author's moral framing without adding any personal opinions. It's important to highlight key points like his refusal to accept election results, encouragement of violence, admiration for dictators, and authoritarian policies.

I need to be careful not to miss any morally charged words in the article. Maybe I'll read through the article again to make sure I catch all of them. Once I have the list, I can craft a summary that weaves these words into a coherent narrative, emphasizing Trump's contempt for democracy and his authoritarian inclinations.

I also need to keep the summary within the word limit, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive. It's a balance between including enough detail to convey the message and keeping it brief. I'll make sure each sentence in the summary adds value and supports the moral framing identified in Step 1.

Alright, I think I have a good plan. I'll start by listing all the morally framed words, then create a summary that incorporates them effectively.

**SUMMARY:**  
The article highlights the GOP presidential nominee's refusal to commit to honoring the election results, a stance that horrified his opponent and reflects his consistent disregard for democratic norms. Trump has long rejected the legitimacy of democracy, as seen in his tweets questioning the 2012 election and his repeated claims of voter fraud. His campaign has been marked by disdain for democratic principles, including peace, acceptance, and respect for the electoral process. Trump has encouraged violence at rallies, praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, and proposed unconstitutional policies, such as banning Muslims and closing mosques. His authoritarian tendencies are evident in his belief that only he can solve the nation's problems, viewing any loss as someone else's fault. His personal vanity and contempt for constitutional limits underscore his desire to become an unchecked, unaccountable leader, not a president of a democratic republic. END OF SUMMARY.
