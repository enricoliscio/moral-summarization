SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" and not criminals. The revised ban has been met with disappointment from affected countries, including Sudan and Iran, which had cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The ban's exclusion of Iraq and clarification of exemptions for certain individuals may make it less vulnerable to legal challenges. However, the UN and other critics argue that the ban will still cause harm to refugees and undermine the US's humanitarian ideals. The ban's impact will be particularly felt by nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp who had hoped to resettle in the US.
