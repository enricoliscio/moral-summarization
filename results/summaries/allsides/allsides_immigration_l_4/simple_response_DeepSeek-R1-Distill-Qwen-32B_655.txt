Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Trump's revised travel ban. The user wants a summary that's under 200 words and preserves the moral framing the author used. I should start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the UN's reaction to the travel ban, mentioning that it affects six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the refugee program. The UN officials are concerned about refugees being ordinary people fleeing violence, and they criticize the ban as unnecessary and wrong. Some countries are disappointed, like Sudan and Iran, but others, like Iraq, didn't take reciprocal actions. The revised ban excludes Iraq, which is important because they're fighting ISIS alongside the US. The UN is worried that the ban will increase the suffering of refugees, especially Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. Other countries, like Saudi Arabia, didn't comment much, and Britain's shadow foreign secretary also criticized the ban.

I need to make sure the summary includes the UN's criticism, the countries affected, the moral stance against the ban, and the impact on refugees. I should also mention the exclusion of Iraq and the potential legal challenges. I have to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Let me structure it: start with the UN's criticism, mention the affected countries, the impact on refugees, reactions from different countries, and the moral implications. Make sure it's all within 200 words and flows well.

SUMMARY: The UN has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, arguing it exacerbates the plight of refugees fleeing war and persecution. The ban blocks entry from six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya) for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. UN officials emphasize that refugees are not criminals but ordinary people forced to flee violence, urging the US to uphold humanitarian ideals. Some affected countries, like Sudan and Iran, expressed disappointment, while Iraq, excluded from the ban, refrained from reciprocal action. The revised order clarifies exemptions for permanent residents and visa holders, but the UN remains concerned it may deepen refugees' suffering, particularly for 15,000 Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. Critics argue the ban is unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, undermining global leadership on refugee protection. END OF SUMMARY.
