Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article talks about Trump's revised travel ban and its impact on refugees, especially those from Muslim-majority countries. The UN is critical, pointing out that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war. The revised ban excludes Iraq but still affects six countries. The UN expresses concern that the ban could worsen the plight of refugees.

I should highlight the UN's stance against the ban, emphasizing their moral argument about refugees' humanity. Also, note the reactions from affected countries and how the revised ban is a slight improvement but still problematic. Mention the specific countries affected and the UN's appeal for humanitarian leadership.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear. Focus on the UN's criticism, the impact on refugees, and the international reactions.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, arguing it will exacerbate the plight of refugees fleeing war, violence, and persecution. The ban, which excludes Iraq but still blocks citizens from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya for 90 days, suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days. UN officials, including Filippo Grandi, emphasize that refugees are not criminals but ordinary people seeking safety. While the revised order includes minor adjustments to address legal vulnerabilities, it still raises concerns about its humanitarian impact. The UN warns that the temporary measures may deepen the suffering of those affected, particularly the nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp hoping to resettle in the U.S. Some countries, like Iran and Sudan, expressed disappointment, while others, like Iraq, refrained from reciprocal actions. The revised ban has drawn criticism from international organizations and leaders, who argue it is unnecessary, divisive, and contrary to humanitarian ideals. END OF SUMMARY.
