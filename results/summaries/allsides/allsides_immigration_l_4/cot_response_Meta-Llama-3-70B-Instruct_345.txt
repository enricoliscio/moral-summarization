SUMMARY:
The revised travel ban issued by Donald Trump will increase the woes of the world's refugees, according to the United Nations. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not criminals but "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution in their home countries." The Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Somalia, where people are dying due to famine. The revised ban has been met with disappointment and concern from affected countries and international organizations, who consider it a retrograde step that will further complicate the grave situation of refugees. The ban is seen as unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, and will compound the anguish for those it affects. END OF SUMMARY.
