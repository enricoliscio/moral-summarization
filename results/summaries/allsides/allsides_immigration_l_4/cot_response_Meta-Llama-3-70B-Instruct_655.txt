SUMMARY:
The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will increase the woes of the world's refugees, who are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence and persecution" in their home countries. The ban, which blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, has been met with disappointment and concern from affected countries and humanitarian organizations. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not "criminals" but people in need of protection. The revised ban has been criticized for being "retrograde," "unnecessary," "divisive," and "wrong," and for sending a "terrible message" to the rest of the world on the refugee crisis. The ban's impact will be felt particularly by nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp who had hoped to resettle in the US. END OF SUMMARY.
