SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban, which affects six Muslim-majority countries, blocks entry to the US for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, not criminals. The revised ban has been met with a more muted response than the original order, partly due to its expected nature and lack of fanfare. However, several countries, including Sudan, Iran, and Somalia, have expressed disappointment and concern. The UN remains concerned that the ban may compound the anguish for those affected, and Grandi urged the US to continue promoting global stability and humanitarian ideals. The revised ban has been criticized for being "unnecessary, divisive, and wrong" and for sending a "terrible message" to the world on the refugee crisis.
