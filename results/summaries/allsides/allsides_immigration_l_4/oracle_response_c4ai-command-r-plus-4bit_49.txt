SUMMARY: Donald Trump's revised travel ban has sparked concerns among the international community and those directly affected. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee programme. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, and that the ban may compound their anguish. Ant√≥nio Guterres, the Secretary General, made an emergency visit to Somalia, highlighting the dire situation caused by famine. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to expectations and legal exemptions, but the UN remains concerned about the impact on refugees. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted, citing his country's capacity to fight terrorism. Some countries affected by the ban expressed disappointment and maintained their cooperation with US anti-terrorist efforts. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, criticized the ban as a retrograde step, abdicating responsibilities under international law. The largest concentration of refugees affected are Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp, hoping to resettle in the US. The Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the deal would not affect the US commitment to take refugees from Manus Island and Nauru refugee centres.
