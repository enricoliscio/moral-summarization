Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author provided. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about Donald Trump's revised travel ban and the reactions from various countries and international organizations. The UN is critical, pointing out that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and violence. The revised ban excludes Iraq but still affects several Muslim-majority countries. Some countries are disappointed, like Iran and Sudan, while others, like Iraq, have held back from reciprocal actions. The UN is concerned that the ban will add to the suffering of refugees, especially Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. There's also mention of the revised order clarifying certain provisions to avoid legal challenges.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral perspective, highlighting the UN's stance on refugees and the impact on vulnerable populations. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and include the key points: the UN's criticism, the countries affected, the revised measures, and the ongoing concerns about humanitarian impact.

Let me structure this: start with the UN's criticism, mention the affected countries, note the exclusion of Iraq, the reactions from Iran and Sudan, the UN's concern about compounding refugees' anguish, and the specific mention of Somalis in Kenya. Also, include the revised order's legal clarifications and the broader implications of the ban.

I should avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Make sure to highlight the moral issues, such as the UN's emphasis on humanitarian ideals and the potential negative message sent by the ban.

Now, putting it all together in a concise summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows logically.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, arguing it exacerbates the plight of refugees fleeing war and persecution. The ban, affecting six Muslim-majority countries, suspends the US refugee program and has drawn disappointment from Iran and Sudan, while Iraq, a key US ally, refrains from reciprocal action. The UN highlights the humanitarian impact, particularly on 15,000 Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. The revised order, though less disruptive than the original, still raises concerns over its temporary yet harmful effects. The UN underscores the importance of humanitarian leadership in addressing global displacement, emphasizing that refugees are ordinary people seeking safety. END OF SUMMARY.
