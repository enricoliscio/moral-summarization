Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's revised travel ban. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the UN is concerned the revised travel ban will worsen the situation for refugees. Some Muslim-majority countries affected are disappointed because they've cooperated with US anti-terrorism efforts. The ban affects six countries: Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya, blocking their citizens from entering the US for 90 days and suspending the refugee program for 120 days.

The UN's high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, is quoted saying refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, not criminals. The secretary general, António Guterres, visited Somalia due to famine. The reaction to the revised ban was less intense than the original one because it was expected and won't be implemented for a week.

Some countries like Sudan expressed disappointment, while Iran said they'll wait to see the details. Libya didn't comment. Iraq was excluded from the ban, and their prime minister avoided reciprocal actions. The revised ban makes some legal changes, like allowing permanent residents and visa holders to enter. However, the UN is still concerned about the impact on refugees.

Somali refugees in Kenya are particularly affected, with nearly 15,000 hoping to resettle in the US. The president of Somalia called for the ban to be lifted. Gulf states like Saudi Arabia remain exempt. The OIC criticized the ban as selective and discriminatory. In Britain, the shadow foreign secretary called the ban a retrograde step, and Australia's PM said it doesn't affect their refugee centers.

So, the key points are: UN concern, countries' reactions, the revised ban's specifics, legal changes, impact on refugees, and international responses.

I need to condense this into a summary of under 200 words. I'll start by stating the UN's concern, mention the affected countries, the duration of the ban, and the suspension of the refugee program. Then, note the UN officials' comments, the muted reaction compared to the original ban, and the reasons. Highlight some countries' responses, the exclusion of Iraq, and the legal clarifications. Mention the UN's ongoing concern and the impact on Somali refugees. Finally, touch on international criticism and responses from Britain and Australia.

I should make sure to include all these elements concisely. Let me structure it step by step to cover each main point without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will exacerbate the challenges faced by refugees, particularly those from six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya. The ban blocks citizens from these countries from entering the US for 90 days and suspends the refugee program for 120 days. UN officials, including Filippo Grandi and António Guterres, have criticized the ban, emphasizing that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution. The revised order, less controversial than the original, excludes Iraq and includes legal clarifications to reduce challenges. However, the UN remains concerned about the impact on vulnerable refugees, particularly nearly 15,000 Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. Some affected countries, like Sudan and Iran, expressed disappointment, while others, such as Libya, did not comment. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation and Britain's shadow foreign secretary criticized the ban as discriminatory and harmful. END OF SUMMARY.
