SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, arguing it will only worsen the suffering of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and has been met with disappointment and concern by the affected nations and humanitarian organizations alike. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution, not criminals. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to expectations and minor changes that make it less vulnerable to legal challenges. Despite some exemptions and clarifications, the UN remains worried about the impact on vulnerable refugees. The largest group affected is likely to be Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp, hoping to find safety in the US. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, called for the ban to be lifted, insisting his country is capable of fighting terrorism. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, criticized the ban as unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, abdicating US responsibilities under international law. The travel ban has been deemed to set a poor moral standard for other countries facing the refugee crisis.
