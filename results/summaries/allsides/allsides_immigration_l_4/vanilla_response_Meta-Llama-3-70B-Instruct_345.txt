SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will worsen the plight of refugees. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, stated that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and violence, not criminals. Some of the affected countries, including Sudan and Iran, have expressed disappointment, saying they had fully cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The revised ban excludes Iraq and makes some other changes to reduce legal challenges. However, the UN remains concerned that the ban will compound the anguish for those it affects. The ban will particularly impact nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp who had hoped to resettle in the US.
