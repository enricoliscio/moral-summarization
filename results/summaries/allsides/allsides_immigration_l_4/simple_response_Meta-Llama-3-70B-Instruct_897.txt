SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban, which affects six Muslim-majority countries, blocks entry to the US for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" and not criminals. The revised ban has been met with disappointment from affected countries, who claim to have cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The UN Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, visited Somalia, highlighting the famine and suffering in the country. Critics argue that the ban is unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, and that it abdicates the US's responsibilities under international law. The revised ban excludes Iraq and makes some changes to reduce legal challenges, but the UN remains concerned about the impact on refugees.
