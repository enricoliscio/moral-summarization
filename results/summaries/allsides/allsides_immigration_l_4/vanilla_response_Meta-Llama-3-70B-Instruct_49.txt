SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern over Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will increase the woes of the world's refugees. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people forced to flee war and violence, not criminals. Some of the affected countries, such as Sudan and Iran, have expressed disappointment and insisted they had fully cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The revised ban excludes Iraq and makes some changes to make it less vulnerable to legal challenges. However, the UN remains concerned that the decision may compound the anguish for those it affects. The ban is expected to affect nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp who had hoped to resettle in the US.
