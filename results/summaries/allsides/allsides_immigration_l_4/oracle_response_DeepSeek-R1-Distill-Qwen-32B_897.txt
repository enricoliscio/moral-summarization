Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. The article talks about Trump's revised travel ban and the UN's response. I should focus on the impact on refugees, the UN's stance, and the reactions from various countries.

First, I'll identify the key points: the UN criticizes the ban, highlighting refugees' plight. The revised ban excludes Iraq but still affects six countries. The UN mentions the humanitarian aspect, using words like 'protection' and 'anguish.' Countries like Iran and Sudan express disappointment. The revised order has some improvements but still faces criticism for being selective and discriminatory.

I need to structure the summary to include the main elements: the UN's criticism, the exclusion of Iraq, the impact on refugees, and the reactions from affected countries. I should use the morally charged words like 'ban,' 'cooperated,' 'blocks,''suspends,' 'war,' 'violence,' 'persecution,' 'dying,' 'protection,' 'compound,' 'anguish,' 'promoting,''support,' 'welcoming,' 'forced,' 'displacement,' 'leadership,' 'wartorn,' 'terrorism,''selective,' 'discriminatory,' 'abdicating,''measures.'

I'll start by stating the UN's criticism, then mention the revised order's details, the UN's emphasis on humanitarian issues, the countries' reactions, and conclude with the broader implications. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure all key moral points are covered without getting too detailed.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each sentence includes the necessary moral framing. I'll check word count as I go to stay within limits.

SUMMARY:  
The United Nations has criticized Donald Trumpâ€™s revised travel ban, arguing it exacerbates the suffering of refugees fleeing war, violence, and persecution. The updated executive order blocks entry to citizens from six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya) for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. UN officials, including Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people forced to flee their homes, not criminals. The revised ban excludes Iraq, a key ally in combating terrorism, and includes minor adjustments to reduce legal vulnerabilities. However, the UN remains concerned that the temporary measures may compound the anguish of those affected, particularly the nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp hoping to resettle in the US. Some countries, like Iran and Sudan, expressed disappointment, while others, such as Iraq, refrained from reciprocal action. The revised ban has been described as selective and discriminatory, with critics arguing it abdicates international responsibilities and undermines humanitarian leadership. END OF SUMMARY.
