SUMMARY: The UN has condemned US President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, saying it will only increase the suffering of vulnerable refugees. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not criminals but people fleeing horrific circumstances. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to expectations and the absence of immediate implementation. Nonetheless, countries affected by the ban expressed disappointment, with Iran stating it will react proportionately. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted, highlighting his country's capacity to combat terrorism. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, criticized the ban as a step backward for the US, despite cosmetic changes. The UN maintains that the US has set a powerful model for other countries in refugee protection and humane leadership, which is needed now more than ever in the face of record-high forced displacement. This stance underscores the moral imperative to provide protection for those fleeing violence and persecution.
