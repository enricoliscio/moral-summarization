Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about Trump's revised travel ban and the reactions from various countries and organizations. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. 

First, I need to read through the article to understand the main points. The revised ban affects six countries, suspends the refugee program, and has caused disappointment among some countries. The UN is concerned about refugees and the impact on vulnerable people. There are mentions of cooperation, misleading data, and the effects on countries like Somalia and Iraq. 

I should focus on the key moral words like "ban," "blocks," "suspends," "war," "violence," "persecution," "protection," "leadership," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary without making it too long—under 200 words.

I'll start by stating the UN's concern about the revised ban increasing refugees' woes. Then mention the countries affected and the suspension of the refugee program. Highlight Filippo Grandi's point about refugees being ordinary people fleeing war. Note the UN Secretary-General's visit to Somalia due to famine. 

Next, I'll address the muted reaction compared to the initial ban and the legal clarifications in the revised order. Include the UN's ongoing concern about the temporary nature of the ban and the impact on vulnerable groups. Mention the specific case of Somali refugees in Kenya. 

Finally, touch on the broader implications, like the UN's call for humanitarian leadership and the criticism from Britain and Australia. Make sure to wrap it up by emphasizing the moral and legal concerns raised by the revised ban.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes all the key moral terms without being too verbose. Let me piece this together step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral framing is preserved.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump’s revised travel ban, stating it will increase the woes of refugees globally. The ban blocks entry to citizens from six Muslim-majority countries—Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya—for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. UN High Commissioner Filippo Grandi emphasized that refugees are not criminals but ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution. UN Secretary-General António Guterres highlighted the dire situation in Somalia, where people are dying due to famine. While the revised order received a more muted reaction than the original, it still faces criticism for its potential to compound the anguish of vulnerable groups. Some countries, like Iran and Sudan, expressed disappointment, while Iraq avoided reciprocal action. The revised order includes legal clarifications, such as allowing permanent residents and visa holders to enter the US, but the UN remains concerned about its humanitarian impact. The ban excludes Iraq, a key ally in the fight against Islamic State. Grandi urged the US to continue its role as a global leader in refugee protection, emphasizing the need for humanitarian ideals amid record-high forced displacement. The revised ban has drawn criticism for being selective, discriminatory, and a retrograde step, with some questioning its alignment with international law. END OF SUMMARY.
