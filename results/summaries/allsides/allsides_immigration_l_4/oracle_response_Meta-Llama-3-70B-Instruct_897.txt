SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will increase the woes of the world's refugees, who are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" in their home countries. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees need protection from "deadly violence" and that this decision may "compound the anguish" for those affected. The revised ban has been met with disappointment from affected countries, with Iran and Sudan expressing their discontent. The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, made an emergency visit to Somalia, highlighting the famine and suffering in the country. The revised ban has been criticized for being "selective and discriminatory" and for "abdicating" the US's responsibilities under international law. Overall, the ban is seen as a "retrograde step" that sends a "terrible message" to the world on the refugee crisis.
