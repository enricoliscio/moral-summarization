SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, arguing that it will only worsen the plight of the world's refugees. The ban, which blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, has been called "unnecessary, divisive and wrong" by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution, and that the US has long played a crucial role in promoting global stability and exemplifying humanitarian ideals. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, also called for the ban to be lifted, insisting that his country has the capacity to fight terrorism. The Iranian government stated that it would react proportionally, while the Sudanese foreign ministry expressed disappointment. Overall, the reaction to the revised ban was more subdued, but it still faces criticism for abdicating US responsibilities under international law and sending a negative message regarding the refugee crisis. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the deal would not impact the US commitment to accepting refugees from the Manus Island and Nauru refugee centers.
