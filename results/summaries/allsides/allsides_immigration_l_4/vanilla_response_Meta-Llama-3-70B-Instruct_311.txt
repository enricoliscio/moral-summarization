SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concerns that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and violence, not criminals. Some of the affected countries, including Sudan and Iran, have expressed disappointment and insisted they had cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The revised ban excludes Iraq and makes some changes to reduce legal challenges. However, the UN remains concerned that the ban may compound the anguish for those affected. Critics, including the UK's shadow foreign secretary, have described the ban as retrograde and unnecessary.
