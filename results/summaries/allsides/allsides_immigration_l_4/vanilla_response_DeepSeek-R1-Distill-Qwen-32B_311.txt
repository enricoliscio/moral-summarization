Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's revised travel ban. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article mentions that the UN is concerned the revised travel ban will worsen the situation for refugees. Countries like Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya are affected, and their citizens are blocked from entering the US for 90 days. The refugee program is suspended for 120 days. The UN's Filippo Grandi and António Guterres have expressed their concerns, especially about Somalia where people are dying due to famine.

The reaction to this revised ban is less intense compared to the original one in January. This might be because it was expected, and it won't be implemented for a week. Some countries, like Sudan, are disappointed, while Iran is waiting to see the details. Iraq was excluded from the ban, which is positive since they're fighting ISIS alongside the US. The new order clarifies that permanent residents and visa holders can still enter, making it less vulnerable to legal challenges.

The UN is still worried that this temporary ban could add to the suffering of refugees, especially Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. Other countries like Saudi Arabia are exempt, and Britain and Australia have their own reactions, with Britain criticizing the move as unnecessary and wrong.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the UN's concerns, the affected countries, the exclusion of Iraq, the legal clarifications, and the impact on refugees, especially Somalis. I'll also mention the reactions from various countries and international organizations.

Let me structure it step by step: start with the UN's criticism, mention the countries affected, the suspension of the refugee program, the muted reaction, reasons for that, specific countries' responses, the exclusion of Iraq, legal changes, UN's ongoing concerns, the impact on Somali refugees, and reactions from other countries and organizations.

I need to make sure it's concise and covers all key points without going over the word limit. I'll avoid including too much detail on each country's reaction to keep it brief.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating it will worsen the plight of refugees. The ban restricts entry for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya) for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. UN officials, including Filippo Grandi and António Guterres, expressed concern, with Guterres visiting Somalia amid famine. The revised ban, less controversial than the original, excludes Iraq, a key ally in fighting ISIS. It also clarifies that permanent residents and visa holders can enter the US, reducing legal challenges. However, the UN remains worried about the impact on refugees, particularly nearly 15,000 Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. Some affected countries, like Iran and Sudan, expressed disappointment, while others, like Iraq, avoided reciprocal action. The revised order has faced criticism from international organizations and countries, including Britain, which called it unnecessary and wrong. END OF SUMMARY.
