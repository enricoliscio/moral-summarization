SUMMARY: Donald Trump's revised travel ban has been criticized by the United Nations for increasing the suffering of the world's refugees. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees worldwide from entering the US for a period of 90 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not criminals but people fleeing war and persecution. The muted reaction to the revised ban may be due to expectations and the absence of immediate implementation. However, the UN remains concerned about the impact on vulnerable refugees. The largest group affected is likely to be Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp hoping to resettle in the US. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted, emphasizing his country's capacity to fight terrorism. The Iranian government said it would wait for details before responding proportionately. Other countries affected, such as Libya and Sudan, expressed disappointment. The Iraqi prime minister's restraint in not reciprocating the ban appears to have been rewarded with Iraq's removal from the list. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, described the ban as unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, despite some cosmetic changes. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the ban would not affect the US commitment to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru.
