SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will increase the woes of the world's refugees, who are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" in their home countries. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, suspending the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized the need for protection and support for people fleeing deadly violence, warning that the ban may compound their anguish. The revised order has been met with disappointment from affected countries, including Sudan and Iran, which have cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The ban has been criticized for being selective and discriminatory, with some countries, like Saudi Arabia, remaining exempt. The UN Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, has pointedly highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Somalia, where people are dying due to famine. The revised ban has been seen as a retrograde step, abdicating the US's responsibilities under international law and sending a terrible message to the rest of the world on the refugee crisis.
