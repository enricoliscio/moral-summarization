SUMMARY:
The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will increase the woes of the world's refugees, who are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" in their home countries. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not "criminals" but people in need of protection from "deadly violence". The revised ban has been met with a muted response, partly due to its expected nature and less chaotic implementation. However, critics argue that the ban is still "retrograde", "unnecessary", "divisive", and "wrong", and will compound the "anguish" for those affected. END OF SUMMARY.
