SUMMARY:
The United Nations has expressed concerns that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will increase the woes of the world's refugees, who are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence and persecution" in their home countries. The ban, which blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, has been criticized for being "unnecessary, divisive and wrong". The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not criminals, but people fleeing "deadly violence" and deserving of "protection" and "dignity". The revised ban has been met with a more muted response compared to the original order, but the UN remains concerned that it may "compound the anguish" for those affected. The ban has been described as a "retrograde step" that sends a "terrible message" to the rest of the world on the refugee crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
