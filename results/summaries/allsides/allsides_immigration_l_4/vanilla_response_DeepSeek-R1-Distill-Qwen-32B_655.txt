Alright, so the user has given me a task to summarize a news article about Donald Trump's revised travel ban. They want the summary to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and to follow a specific format with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens. 

First, I need to understand the key points of the article. The UN is criticizing the ban, saying it affects refugees negatively. Some countries are disappointed because they cooperated with the US on counter-terrorism. The revised ban excludes Iraq but still affects six countries, and it suspends the refugee program for 120 days. The UN's Filippo Grandi and António Guterres have reactions, including Guterres visiting Somalia. The response is less intense than the original ban. Some countries like Iran and Sudan are reacting, while others like Iraq are not taking reciprocal actions. The new order clarifies some legal points but the UN is still concerned. There's mention of specific groups affected, like Somalis in Kenya, and reactions from international organizations and other countries.

I need to condense all this into a summary that's under 200 words. I should highlight the main criticisms, the countries affected, the UN's stance, the revised elements, and the reactions from different entities. I need to make sure it's clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary details.

I should start by stating the UN's criticism, mention the countries affected, the suspension of the refugee program, and the UN officials' concerns. Then note the less intense reaction compared to the first ban, the exclusion of Iraq, and the clarifications in the new order. Highlight that the UN remains concerned and mention specific groups like Somalis. Also, include reactions from Iran, Sudan, and international organizations. Finally, wrap up with the UN's call for humanitarian leadership.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all critical points without exceeding the word limit. I'll structure it in a few sentences, each covering a main point, and end with the UN's message about leadership and responsibility.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating it will worsen the plight of refugees. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya) from entering the US for 90 days and suspends the refugee program for 120 days. UN officials, including Filippo Grandi and António Guterres, expressed concerns, with Guterres visiting Somalia amid a famine crisis. The revised ban, which excludes Iraq, has drawn less intense reactions than the original, partly due to its delayed implementation. Some affected countries, like Iran and Sudan, expressed disappointment, while Iraq refrained from reciprocal actions. The new order clarifies protections for permanent residents and visa holders but remains a concern for refugees, particularly nearly 15,000 Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. International organizations and countries, including Britain, criticized the ban as unnecessary and divisive. The UN emphasized the need for humanitarian leadership in addressing the global refugee crisis. END OF SUMMARY.
