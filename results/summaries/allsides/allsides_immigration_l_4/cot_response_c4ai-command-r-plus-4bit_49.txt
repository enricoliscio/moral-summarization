SUMMARY:
The UN has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only worsen the woes of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing violence and persecution. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to its expected nature and the absence of immediate implementation. Some countries affected by the ban, such as Sudan and Iran, expressed their disappointment, while Libya remains focused on its internal fighting. The Iraqi prime minister's self-restraint and lobbying appear to have paid off, with Iraq being excluded from the revised ban. The UN remains concerned about the impact of the ban on vulnerable refugees and the message it sends to the world regarding humanitarian ideals and stability. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, described the ban as a retrograde step, criticizing the administration for abdicating its responsibilities under international law. The ban has been deemed unnecessary, divisive, and wrong. The Australian prime minister, however, assured that the deal would not affect the US commitment to accepting refugees from Manus Island and Nauru refugee centers.
