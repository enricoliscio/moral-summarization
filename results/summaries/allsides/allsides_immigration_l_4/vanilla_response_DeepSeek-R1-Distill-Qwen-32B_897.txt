Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's revised travel ban. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by mentioning that the UN has criticized Trump's revised travel ban, saying it will worsen the situation for refugees. The affected countries, mostly Muslim-majority, are disappointed because they've cooperated with US anti-terrorism efforts. The ban affects six countries: Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya, with a 90-day entry block and a 120-day suspension of the refugee program.

The UN's Filippo Grandi points out that refugees aren't criminals but ordinary people fleeing war. Guterres visited Somalia due to famine. The reaction to this revised ban is less intense than the first one because it was expected and won't be implemented for a week, avoiding the chaos of the first ban. Some small changes in the new order, like allowing permanent residents and visa holders, make it less vulnerable to legal challenges, but the UN is still concerned.

Iraq was excluded from the ban, which is positive since they're fighting ISIS together. Countries like Iran and Sudan are disappointed, and Iran is maintaining its retaliatory measures. The Gulf states, like Saudi Arabia, aren't affected and haven't commented much. The OIC criticized the ban as discriminatory. Britain's shadow foreign secretary also criticized it as unnecessary and wrong. Australia's PM said it doesn't affect their refugee commitments.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the UN's criticism, the affected countries, the UN's stance, the muted reaction, the legal changes, and the international reactions, including the exclusion of Iraq and the impact on refugees.

Let me structure it step by step:

1. UN criticism of the revised travel ban.
2. Affected countries and their disappointment.
3. UN's view on refugees and the impact on Somalia.
4. Muted reaction compared to the first ban.
5. Legal clarifications in the revised order.
6. UN's concern despite changes.
7. Exclusion of Iraq and its implications.
8. Reactions from Iran, Sudan, OIC, Britain, and Australia.
9. Impact on refugees, especially Somalis in Kenya.

I need to ensure the summary is clear and covers all these points without going over the word limit. I'll make sure to mention the key players and the main criticisms and reactions.
