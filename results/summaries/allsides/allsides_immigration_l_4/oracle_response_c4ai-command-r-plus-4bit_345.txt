SUMMARY: Donald Trump's revised travel ban, which blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program, has been criticized by the United Nations for increasing the suffering of the world's refugees. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, and that protecting them is imperative. The ban has also been described as a retrograde step that sends a terrible message to the world about the refugee crisis. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, called for the ban to be lifted, insisting that his country has the capacity to fight terrorism. The original order faced outrage and chaotic implementation, but the revised ban excludes Iraq and makes some legal exemptions, leading to a more muted response. However, the UN remains concerned about the impact of the decision on vulnerable refugees, and the Somali president emphasized the need for humane leadership in addressing the global refugee crisis. The largest concentration of affected refugees is likely to be nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan camp, hoping to resettle in the US.
