SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to its expected nature and delayed implementation. Some affected countries, such as Sudan and Iran, expressed disappointment, while others like Libya, currently embroiled in internal conflict, did not issue fresh statements. The ban now excludes Iraq, a key US ally in the fight against Islamic State. The UN remains concerned about the impact of the ban on vulnerable refugees, with the largest concentration being Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted, emphasizing his country's capacity to fight terrorism. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation criticized the ban as discriminatory, while the Australian Prime Minister confirmed that the ban would not affect the US commitment to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru.
