SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized US President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The affected countries have expressed their disappointment, emphasizing their cooperation with US counter-terrorism efforts. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to its expected nature and the absence of immediate implementation. The Sudanese foreign ministry expressed disappointment, while Iran stated that it would wait for details before responding proportionally. Libya has not issued a fresh statement, but the largest concentration of affected refugees is likely in a Kenyan camp housing Somalis hoping to resettle in the US. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted, and the Gulf states, like Saudi Arabia, remain exempt. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation criticized the ban as discriminatory, while Britain's shadow foreign secretary described it as a retrograde step. The Australian prime minister, however, assured that the deal wouldn't affect the US commitment to taking refugees from Manus Island and Nauru.
