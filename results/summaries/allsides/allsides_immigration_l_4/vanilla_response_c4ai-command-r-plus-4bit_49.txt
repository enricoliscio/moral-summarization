SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized US President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program for a set period. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing dire circumstances and that the US has a crucial role in promoting global stability and humanitarian ideals. The Somali president also called for the ban to be lifted, highlighting his country's capacity to combat terrorism. Iran, another affected country, has stated it will wait for details before responding proportionally. The ban has been criticized by various parties, including the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the UK's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, for being unnecessary, divisive, and wrong. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, however, assured that the deal would not impact the US commitment to accept refugees from Manus Island and Nauru refugee centers.
