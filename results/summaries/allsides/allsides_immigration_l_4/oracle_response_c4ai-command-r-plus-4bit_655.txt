SUMMARY: The UN has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, warning it will worsen the suffering of refugees. The executive order blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, and that the US has a crucial role in promoting stability and humanitarian ideals. The ban has also drawn disappointment from affected countries, who argue that they have cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, called for the ban to be lifted, insisting his country is capable of fighting terrorism. The original ban faced widespread outrage and legal challenges, but the revised version has seen a more muted response. However, critics like the UK's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, still view it as a retrograde step, criticizing the US for abdicating its responsibilities under international law. The ban has been described as unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, compounding the anguish of those affected.
