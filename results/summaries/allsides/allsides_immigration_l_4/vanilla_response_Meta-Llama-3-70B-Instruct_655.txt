SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concerns that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya) from entering the US for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, not criminals. The reaction to the revised ban has been more muted compared to the original order, partly due to its expected nature and less fanfare. Some countries affected by the ban, such as Sudan and Iran, have expressed disappointment, while others, like Libya, have remained silent. The revised ban excludes Iraq and makes some changes to reduce legal challenges. The UN remains concerned that the ban may compound the anguish for those it affects.
