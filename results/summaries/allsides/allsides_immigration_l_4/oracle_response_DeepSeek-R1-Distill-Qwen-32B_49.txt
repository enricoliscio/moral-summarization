Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about Trump's revised travel ban, its impact on refugees, reactions from affected countries, and the UN's stance.

I notice the author uses words like "ban," "blocks," "suspends," and "misleading" to convey negative aspects. The moral framing includes terms related to cooperation, protection, violence, and humanitarian ideals. I should keep these words in the summary.

The key points are: the revised ban affects six countries, suspends the refugee program, UN's criticism, the muted reaction compared to the first ban, and the impact on refugees. I need to mention the UN's concern, the fact that it's a temporary measure, and how it affects vulnerable groups like Somalis in Kenya.

I should also include the exclusion of Iraq and the changes that make the ban less vulnerable to legal challenges, such as allowing permanent residents and visa holders. The UN emphasizes humanitarian ideals and the importance of leadership in refugee protection.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main moral points without getting into too much detail. I'll structure it to highlight the negative impacts and the UN's stance, using the morally framed words as much as possible.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows well and covers all necessary points while preserving the moral language.

SUMMARY: Donald Trump's revised travel ban, which blocks entry to citizens from six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya) for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days, has drawn criticism from the UN and affected nations. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not criminals but ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution. The revised order, though less chaotic than the original, still compounds the anguish of vulnerable groups, including nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp hoping to resettle in the US. The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, highlighted the need for protection and humanitarian leadership, urging the US to uphold its role in promoting global stability and refugee welfare. While some countries expressed disappointment, others, like Iran, maintained retaliatory measures. The revised ban excludes Iraq, a key ally in combating ISIS, and includes minor changes to avoid legal challenges, such as allowing permanent residents and visa holders to enter. However, the UN remains concerned that the decision, though temporary, may exacerbate the plight of refugees. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation and British officials criticized the ban as selective, discriminatory, and a retrograde step, arguing it abdicates international responsibilities. END OF SUMMARY.
