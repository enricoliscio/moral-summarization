SUMMARY: The UN has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will exacerbate the plight of refugees, with the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasizing that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, not criminals. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program. The reaction to the revised ban has been more subdued than the initial outrage, partly due to expectations and the absence of immediate implementation. Countries affected by the ban, such as Iran, Sudan, and Somalia, have expressed disappointment, with some highlighting their cooperation in anti-terrorist efforts. The UN high commissioner for refugees and the secretary general have both underscored the importance of protecting those fleeing deadly violence and persecution, with the former describing the US's role in promoting global stability and exemplifying humane ideals as the "gold standard in refugee protection." The shadow foreign secretary in Britain has criticized the ban as a retrograde step, highlighting the abdication of responsibilities under international law and the divisive and wrong message it sends. The article also mentions the impact on refugees in Kenya and the muted response from Saudi Arabia. The Australian prime minister has stated that the ban will not affect the US commitment to accepting refugees from Manus Island and Nauru.
