SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only worsen the situation for refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing dangerous situations. The reaction to the revised ban has been more subdued than the initial outrage over the first executive order, partly because it was expected and will not take effect immediately. The Sudanese foreign ministry expressed disappointment, while Iran stated it would wait for more details before reacting. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted and emphasized his country's capacity to fight terrorism. The UN remains concerned about the impact of the ban, while other countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, remain exempt. Critics argue that the ban is unnecessary, divisive, and a retrograde step for the US. The Australian prime minister, however, assured that the ban would not affect the US commitment to take refugees from Manus Island and Nauru refugee centers.
