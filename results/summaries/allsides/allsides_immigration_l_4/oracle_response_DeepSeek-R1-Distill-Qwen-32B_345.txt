Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally charged words. My task is to create a concise summary using as many of those words as possible, keeping it under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses Trump's revised travel ban, its impact on refugees, reactions from affected countries, and the UN's stance. The moral framing is strong, highlighting issues like cooperation, persecution, and humanitarian ideals.

I'll start by identifying key events: the revised ban excludes Iraq, blocks entry from six countries, suspends the refugee program, and faces criticism from the UN and affected nations. The UN emphasizes the humanitarian aspect, while countries express disappointment and some maintain their own measures against the US.

Next, I'll incorporate the morally framed words. Words like "ban," "blocks," "suspends," "cooperated," "persecution," "dying," "protection," "compound," "anguish," "promoting," "exemplifying," "support," "welcoming," "forced," "displacement," "leadership," "wartorn," "terrorism," "selective," "discriminatory," "abdicating," and "measures" should be included where appropriate.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the UN's concern, the impact on refugees, the reactions from countries, and the broader implications of the ban. I'll ensure the summary flows logically, connecting each point with the moral language provided.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure each sentence uses the moral terms and stays within the word limit. I'll check that all key points are covered without going over 200 words. Finally, I'll review to ensure clarity and that the moral framing is preserved throughout.

SUMMARY: The UN has criticized Donald Trumpâ€™s revised travel ban, stating it will worsen the plight of refugees, particularly those fleeing war, violence, and persecution. The ban blocks entry from six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya) for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. UN High Commissioner Filippo Grandi emphasized that refugees are ordinary people forced to flee their homes, not criminals. The revised order, while less disruptive than the initial chaos, still raises concerns about protection and humanitarian ideals. Some countries, like Iran and Sudan, expressed disappointment, while Iraq was exempted, likely due to its cooperation with US counterterrorism efforts. The UN warned the decision could compound the anguish of refugees, particularly Somalis in Kenya hoping to resettle in the US. The revised ban faces criticism for being selective and discriminatory, with the UN and others urging the US to uphold its leadership in promoting global stability and humanitarian values. The move has been called a retrograde step, abdicating international responsibilities and sending a harmful message on refugee displacement. END OF SUMMARY.
