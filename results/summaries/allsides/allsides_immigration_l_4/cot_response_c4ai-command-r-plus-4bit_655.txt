SUMMARY: 
The UN has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will worsen the woes of refugees from the affected Muslim-majority countries. The ban blocks citizens from six countries and suspends the US refugee program. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people forced to flee their homes due to war, violence, and persecution. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to expectations and the lack of immediate implementation. The Sudanese foreign ministry expressed disappointment, while Iran is waiting to react proportionally. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted, insisting his country can fight terrorism. The UN high commissioner, Filippo Grandi, expressed concern about the anguish caused by the decision and emphasized the imperative to provide protection for people fleeing deadly violence. He praised Americans for their crucial role in promoting global stability and exemplifying the highest humanitarian ideals through their support for refugee emergencies and welcoming vulnerable refugee families. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, criticized the ban as a retrograde step, stating that the administration is abdicating its responsibilities under international law and sending a terrible message. She emphasized that the measures are unnecessary, divisive, and wrong. The summary concludes with the Australian prime minister's assurance that the deal won't affect the US commitment to taking refugees from Manus Island and Nauru refugee centers.
