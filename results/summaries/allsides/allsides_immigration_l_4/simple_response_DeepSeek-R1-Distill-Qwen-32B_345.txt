Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's revised travel ban. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article talks about the UN's reaction, disappointment from some countries, and the impact on refugees. I should highlight the moral issues like how the ban affects vulnerable people and the UN's stance on humanitarian ideals. Also, the revised ban excludes Iraq but still impacts many, so I need to mention that. I'll keep it under 200 words, focusing on key points: UN's criticism, the impact on refugees, reactions from affected countries, and the moral implications. Let me structure it to show the humanitarian concern and the potential for increased suffering. I should make sure to include Filippo Grandi's quote about refugees not being criminals. Also, note that the revised order has some changes but still raises concerns. Finally, mention the broader implications for global leadership on refugee issues.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, arguing it exacerbates the plight of refugees, particularly from Muslim-majority countries. The ban blocks entry for citizens from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. UN High Commissioner Filippo Grandi emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution, not criminals. The revised order, which excludes Iraq, has drawn muted reactions compared to the initial ban, though affected countries like Sudan and Iran expressed disappointment. The UN remains concerned that the temporary measures may deepen the anguish of those affected, particularly the nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp hoping to resettle in the US. Grandi highlighted the US's historical role in refugee protection, urging continued humanitarian leadership. Critics argue the ban is unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, with some calling it a retrograde step. END OF SUMMARY.
