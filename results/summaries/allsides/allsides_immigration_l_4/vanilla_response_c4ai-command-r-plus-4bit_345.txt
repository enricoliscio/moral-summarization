SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized US President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing dangerous situations and that the ban may compound their suffering. While the reaction to the revised ban was more subdued compared to the initial order, some countries affected by the ban, such as Sudan and Iran, expressed their disappointment. The Somali president called for the ban to be lifted, highlighting his country's capacity to fight terrorism. The Iraqi prime minister's restraint in response to the original order appears to have paid off, with Iraq being excluded from the revised ban. The UN remains concerned about the impact of the ban on vulnerable refugees, and the shadow foreign secretary for Britain, Emily Thornberry, criticized the ban as unnecessary and divisive. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the deal would not affect the US commitment to accept refugees from Manus Island and Nauru.
