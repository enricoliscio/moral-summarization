Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Donald Trump's revised travel ban. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that the UN is concerned the revised travel ban will worsen the situation for refugees. Some Muslim-majority countries are disappointed because they cooperated with US anti-terrorism efforts. The ban affects six countries: Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya, blocking entry for 90 days and suspending the refugee program for 120 days. The UN's Filippo Grandi and Ant√≥nio Guterres have spoken out, with Guterres visiting Somalia due to famine.

The reaction is less intense than the first ban because it was expected and won't be implemented for a week. Some countries like Iran and Sudan are disappointed but not taking immediate action. Iraq is excluded, which is significant because they're fighting ISIS together. The revised ban has some legal clarifications, like allowing permanent residents and visa holders in. The UN is still worried about the impact on refugees, especially Somalis in Kenya. The Gulf states are exempt, and other countries like Britain and Australia have their own reactions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should focus on the key points: UN's concern, affected countries, the revised ban's specifics, reactions from countries, and the impact on refugees. Also, note the legal changes and the UN's stance on humanitarian ideals.

Let me structure it: start with the UN's criticism, mention the countries affected, the revised measures, reactions from countries, the impact on refugees, and the UN's call for humanitarian action. Make sure it's concise and covers all main aspects without going into too much detail.

I should avoid including every minor detail, like specific countries' statements unless they're significant. For example, mentioning that Iran is still enforcing retaliatory measures is important. Also, highlighting that the revised ban excludes Iraq is a key point.

I need to ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the UN's stance, moving to the countries' reactions, the impact on refugees, and the UN's broader message. Keep it clear and within the word limit.

Let me check the word count as I draft. Make sure each sentence is concise and captures the essence without unnecessary details. Avoid jargon, keep it straightforward.

Now, putting it all together: the UN criticizes the revised travel ban, affecting six countries, suspending the refugee program. Some countries are disappointed, but reactions are muted. The ban excludes Iraq, which is significant. The UN highlights the humanitarian impact, especially on Somalis. The revised order has legal clarifications but the UN remains concerned. The UN calls for continued leadership in refugee protection.

I think that covers all the main points succinctly. Now, let me write the summary accordingly, making sure it's under 200 words.
