SUMMARY: Donald Trump's revised travel ban has been met with disappointment and concern by affected countries and the United Nations, who believe it will only increase the suffering of refugees. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program, despite these countries having fully cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, and that the ban may compound their anguish. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to the exclusion of Iraq, a country currently fighting alongside the US against Islamic State. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, called for the ban to be lifted, insisting his country has the capacity to fight terrorism. The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, made an emergency visit to Somalia, highlighting the dire situation of people dying due to famine. The revised ban has been criticized as unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, with some arguing that it abdicates America's responsibilities under international law and sets a poor example for other countries facing the refugee crisis. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the deal would not affect the US commitment to take refugees from Manus Island and Nauru refugee centers.
