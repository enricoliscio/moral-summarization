SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will increase the woes of the world's refugees, who are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" in their home countries. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not criminals, but people in need of protection from deadly violence. The revised ban has been met with disappointment from affected countries, including Sudan and Iran, who had cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The ban's implementation has been criticized for being based on misleading data and for compounding the anguish of those it affects. The UN has urged the US to continue promoting global stability and exemplifying humanitarian ideals, particularly in a time of record-high levels of forced human displacement. The ban has been labeled as "selective and discriminatory" and has been criticized for abdicating the US's responsibilities under international law.
