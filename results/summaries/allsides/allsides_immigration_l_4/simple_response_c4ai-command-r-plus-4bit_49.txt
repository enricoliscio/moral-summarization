SUMMARY: Donald Trump's revised travel ban has been met with disappointment and concern by various countries and organizations, who argue that it will only worsen the plight of refugees and send the wrong message to the world. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution, and that the US has long played a crucial role in promoting global stability and humanitarian ideals. The ban blocks entry for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program, causing dismay in countries like Somalia, Iran, and Sudan. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, insisted that his country has the capacity to fight terrorism, while the Iranian deputy foreign minister stated that their "retaliatory decision" over the initial ban is still in place. The UN Secretary General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, made an emergency visit to Somalia, highlighting the dire situation caused by famine. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to expectations and legal adjustments, but it still faces criticism for being unnecessary, divisive, and wrong. The Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the deal would not affect the US commitment to take refugees from Manus Island and Nauru refugee centers. This decision goes against the gold standard in refugee protection and humane leadership, as stated by Grandi.
