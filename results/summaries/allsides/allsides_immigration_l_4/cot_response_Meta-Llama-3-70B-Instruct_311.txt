SUMMARY:
The revised travel ban issued by Donald Trump will increase the woes of the world's refugees, according to the United Nations. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee programme for 120 days. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" and not criminals. The secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, pointedly made an emergency visit to Somalia, where people are dying due to famine. The revised ban has been met with disappointment and concern, with many criticizing it as a "retrograde step" that sends a "terrible message" to the world on the refugee crisis. The ban is seen as "unnecessary, divisive, and wrong" and may compound the "anguish" for those it affects. END OF SUMMARY.
