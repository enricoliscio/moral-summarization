Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. The main points are about Trump's revised travel ban, the UN's criticism, and reactions from affected countries. The article mentions that the UN says the ban will increase refugees' suffering and that some countries are disappointed. The revised ban excludes Iraq but includes others like Iran, Somalia, etc. The UN emphasizes that refugees are ordinary people fleeing danger, and there's a concern that the ban may worsen their situation. The moral angle is about compassion and humanitarian ideals, so I should highlight the UN's stance on that. Also, the revised ban has some legal clarifications but still faces criticism. I'll need to keep it under 200 words, focusing on the UN's concerns, affected countries, and the moral implications. I should make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating it will exacerbate the plight of refugees, particularly from Muslim-majority countries. The ban blocks entry from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya for 90 days and suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days. UN High Commissioner Filippo Grandi emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution, urging compassion. The revised ban, less controversial than the initial one, excludes Iraq but faces criticism for its humanitarian impact. Countries like Sudan and Iran expressed disappointment, while Iraq avoided reciprocal action. The UN warns the ban may deepen refugees' suffering, highlighting the importance of humanitarian ideals and global leadership in addressing displacement. END OF SUMMARY.
