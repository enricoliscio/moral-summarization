SUMMARY: The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only exacerbate the suffering of refugees worldwide. The executive order bars citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution. He appealed to Americans' longstanding humanitarian ideals and their crucial role in promoting global stability. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, called for the ban to be lifted, insisting his country has the capacity to fight terrorism. The reaction to the revised ban was more muted, partly due to expectations and the absence of chaotic implementation. However, critics like the UK's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, still deem it a retrograde, unnecessary, divisive, and wrong step. The UN and other critics emphasize the need to protect vulnerable refugees and provide humane leadership in addressing the global refugee crisis. They view the ban as a betrayal of American moral leadership and a violation of international law. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the ban would not affect the US commitment to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru. The muted response to the revised ban reflects a cautious approach, but the underlying moral concerns remain. END OF SUMMARY.
