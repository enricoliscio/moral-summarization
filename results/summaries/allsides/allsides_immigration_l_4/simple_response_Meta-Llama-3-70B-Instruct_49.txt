SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern over Donald Trump's revised travel ban, which will increase the suffering of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, not criminals. The Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, visited Somalia, where people are dying due to famine. The reaction to the revised ban was more muted than the outrage over the original order, partly because it was widely expected and implemented with less fanfare. Iran, Sudan, and Libya expressed disappointment, while Iraq was excluded from the ban. The UN remains concerned that the decision may compound the anguish for those affected, and Grandi emphasized the need for humane leadership in promoting global stability and refugee protection.
