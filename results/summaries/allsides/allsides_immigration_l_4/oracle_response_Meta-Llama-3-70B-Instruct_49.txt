SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will increase the woes of the world's refugees, who are "ordinary people forced to flee war, violence, and persecution" in their home countries. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are not criminals, but people in need of protection from deadly violence. The revised ban has been met with disappointment from affected countries, who claim to have fully cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts. The UN Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, made an emergency visit to Somalia, where people are dying due to famine. The revised ban has been criticized for being selective and discriminatory, and for abdicating the US's responsibilities under international law. The UN remains concerned that the ban may compound the anguish for those it affects, and has urged the US to promote global stability and exemplify humanitarian ideals.
