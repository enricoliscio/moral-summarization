SUMMARY: The revised travel ban issued by US President Donald Trump has been criticized by the United Nations for exacerbating the suffering of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks citizens from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to its expected nature and delayed implementation. However, the UN remains concerned about the impact on vulnerable refugees. The ban has also been criticized by affected countries and organizations such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which described it as "selective and discriminatory." Despite some small changes, the ban continues to face legal challenges and moral scrutiny. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, called for the ban to be lifted, emphasizing his country's capacity to fight terrorism. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, described the ban as a retrograde step for the US, criticizing the administration for abdicating its responsibilities under international law. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, assured that the ban would not affect the US commitment to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru. The revised ban excludes Iraq and makes exemptions for permanent residents, existing visa holders, and dual citizens.
