SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern over Donald Trump's revised travel ban, which will worsen the plight of the world's refugees. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war, violence, and persecution, not criminals. The revised ban has been met with a more muted response compared to the original order, partly because it was expected and will not be implemented immediately. However, many countries, including Iran, Sudan, and Somalia, have expressed disappointment and concern over the ban. The UN has urged the US to continue providing protection for people fleeing deadly violence, citing the country's historical role in promoting global stability and humanitarian ideals. The ban has been criticized for being unnecessary, divisive, and wrong, and its revised version has done little to address these concerns.
