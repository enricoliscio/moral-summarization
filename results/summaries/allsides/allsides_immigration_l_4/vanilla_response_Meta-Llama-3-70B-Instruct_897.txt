SUMMARY:

The United Nations has expressed concern that Donald Trump's revised travel ban will worsen the plight of refugees worldwide. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspends the US refugee program for 120 days. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing war and persecution, not criminals. Some affected countries, such as Sudan and Iran, have expressed disappointment and vowed to react accordingly. The revised ban excludes Iraq and makes some changes to avoid legal challenges. However, the UN remains concerned that the ban may compound the anguish for those affected. The ban will particularly impact nearly 15,000 Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp who hoped to resettle in the US. World leaders, including the UK's shadow foreign secretary, have criticized the ban as retrograde and divisive.
