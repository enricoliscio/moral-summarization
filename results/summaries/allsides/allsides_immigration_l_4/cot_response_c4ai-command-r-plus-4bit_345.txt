SUMMARY:
The United Nations has criticized Donald Trump's revised travel ban, stating that it will only increase the woes of refugees from the six Muslim-majority countries affected. The ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and Libya, and suspends the US refugee program. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, emphasized that refugees are ordinary people fleeing violence and persecution, not criminals. The muted reaction to the revised ban is partly due to the exclusion of Iraq, with which the US is currently fighting against Islamic State, and the fact that it was widely expected and delivered with less fanfare. The Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, called for the ban to be lifted and insisted that his country has the capacity to fight terrorism. The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, made an emergency visit to Somalia, highlighting the deadly impact of famine in the country. The revised ban has been described as unnecessary, divisive, and wrong by critics, including the shadow foreign secretary of Britain, Emily Thornberry. The Iranian deputy foreign minister also stated that Iran's retaliatory decision over the initial travel ban is still in place. The largest concentration of refugees affected are likely to be Somalis in a Kenyan refugee camp, hoping to resettle in the US. The ban has been criticized for abdicating US responsibilities under international law and sending a terrible message to the world regarding the refugee crisis.
