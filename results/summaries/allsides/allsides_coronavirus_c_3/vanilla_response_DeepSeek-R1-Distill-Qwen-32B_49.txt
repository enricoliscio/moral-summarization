Okay, I need to summarize this news article about COVID-19's impact on nursing homes in the U.S. The user provided the article and an example of how the summary should look. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article starts by stating that at least 54,000 residents and workers in nursing homes have died from COVID-19. That's a significant number, especially since the U.S. has more nursing home deaths than any country except Brazil. It mentions that people over 65 make up 75% of COVID deaths, which shows how vulnerable the elderly are.

The reasons for high fatalities include the age of residents, communal living, and the virus spreading easily. Some facilities have had over 70 deaths. The article also notes that while nursing home residents are less than 1% of the population, they account for over 40% of COVID deaths, with a fatality rate three times the national average.

There's a debate about the flaws in the nursing home system, like limited resources, poor government support, low staff pay, lack of oversight, and financial incentives for poor care. The population of the elderly is expected to double by 2050, which could strain the system further.

Some experts suggest increasing home care with government funding, technology, and community support, which could be cheaper and better for health outcomes. Others worry that restructuring could leave behind poorer people and minorities who can't afford home care. They argue that improving funding, staff pay, and government accountability could fix the current system.

Perspectives include the need for government-funded home care, highlighting ongoing nursing home issues, using technology for home care, and preparing for a growing elderly population.

Now, I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll start by stating the high death toll, the vulnerability of the elderly, and the factors contributing to nursing home outbreaks. Then, I'll mention the debate about the system's flaws and proposed solutions like home care versus improving current facilities. I'll include perspectives on home care, technology, and future population growth.

I should make sure the summary is concise, covering all main points without going into too much detail. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the problem, then the debate, and the different perspectives on solutions.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's under 200 words. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language clear and straightforward. Also, I'll end with the required tokens: "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Now, I'll put it all together in a coherent summary.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused devastating losses in U.S. nursing homes, with at least 54,000 residents and workers dying from the virus. Nursing homes account for over 40% of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S., despite residents making up less than 1% of the population. The elderly are particularly vulnerable, with those over 65 representing three-quarters of all COVID-19 deaths. The combination of residents' age, communal living, and pre-existing systemic issues like limited resources and underpaid staff has exacerbated the crisis. Some argue that the pandemic highlights the need for a radical shift toward at-home care, supported by technology and government funding, to reduce reliance on nursing homes. Others caution that such changes could disproportionately affect poorer communities and people of color, who may lack access to home care. Experts suggest improving funding, staff pay, and oversight as alternatives to restructuring the system. The debate underscores the urgent need to address the flaws in elder care as the U.S. prepares for a rapidly aging population. END OF SUMMARY.
