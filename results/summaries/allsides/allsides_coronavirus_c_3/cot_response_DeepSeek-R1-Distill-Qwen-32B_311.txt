Okay, so the user wants me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and the debate around the elder care system. My task is to first identify all the single words that are morally framed and then write a summary preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral or ethical connotation, like "vulnerable," "flaws," "strains," etc. I'll go through the article and pick out each word that fits this category.

Looking at the article, I see words like "vulnerable," "flaws," "strains," "substandard," "inequitable," "accountability," "catalyst," "ignore," "burden," "adapting," "thoughtfully," "challenges," "contributing," "adapts," and "prioritizes." Each of these words carries a moral weight, highlighting issues or suggesting solutions that have ethical implications.

Next, I need to summarize the article while keeping as many of these moral words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the main points: the high death toll in nursing homes, the flaws in the system, debates on solutions like at-home care versus improving nursing homes, and the need for better policies.

I should structure the summary to first present the statistics and the moral issues, then outline the proposed solutions, and finally address the counterarguments and the need for systemic changes. This way, the moral framing is preserved throughout the summary.

I'll make sure to include the key points: the number of deaths, the vulnerable population, the flaws in the system, the debate between at-home care and improving nursing homes, the potential for technology and family support, and the need for government action and equitable solutions.

I need to keep the language clear and concise, ensuring that the moral words are integrated naturally into the summary without making it sound forced. The goal is to maintain the original article's ethical perspective while condensing the information.

Alright, I think I have a good plan. I'll list out the morally framed words first, then craft a summary that weaves them in appropriately, keeping it within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of the U.S. nursing home system, with over 54,000 residents dying from the virus. Nursing homes account for over 40% of COVID-19 deaths, despite housing less than 1% of the population. The high fatality rate among residents highlights systemic issues, including limited resources, underpaid staff, and inadequate oversight. Critics argue that the systemâ€™s flaws, such as financial structures that incentivize substandard care, must be addressed to better support the aging population. Some propose shifting elder care to home-based solutions, supported by technology and community efforts, to reduce the burden on nursing homes. However, others warn that this could leave behind marginalized groups, emphasizing the need for equitable funding and policy changes. The pandemic has forced a reevaluation of how the U.S. cares for its elderly, with a growing call for systemic reforms to adapt to the aging population and ensure better outcomes for all.
