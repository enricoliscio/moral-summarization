Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about COVID-19's impact on nursing homes and the debate over the U.S. elder care system. 

First, I'll note the key points: over 54,000 deaths in nursing homes, which is a significant portion of total COVID-19 deaths. The author uses words like "changing," "support," "oversight," "care," etc., so I need to include those.

I should start by highlighting the high death toll and why nursing homes are vulnerable. Then, mention the debate about systemic issues like limited resources and poor oversight. The proposed solutions include increasing home care funding and improving nursing home conditions. 

I also need to address the counterarguments, like how restructuring might leave behind marginalized groups. Finally, I'll wrap it up by emphasizing the need for systemic change and support for the elderly.

I'll make sure to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and include the morally framed words as much as possible. Let me structure this step by step to ensure all points are covered without losing the moral context.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed critical flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, with over 54,000 residents dying from the virus, accounting for over 40% of total COVID-19 deaths. The high fatality rate highlights systemic issues such as limited resources, poor oversight, and underpaid staff. Some argue that a shift to at-home care, supported by government funding and technology, could improve outcomes and reduce strain on nursing homes. However, others warn that such a change could leave behind vulnerable populations, including people of color and those with unstable housing. Experts emphasize the need for systemic change, including increased funding for care, fairer healthcare, and better oversight to address the aging population's growing needs. The pandemic has forced society to confront long-ignored problems in elder care, underscoring the moral imperative to act and support a more equitable system for the elderly. END OF SUMMARY.
