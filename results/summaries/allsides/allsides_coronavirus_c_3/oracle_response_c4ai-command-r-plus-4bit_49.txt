SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the flaws in the United States' nursing home system, with at least 54,000 residents and workers dying from the virus. The high death toll has sparked a debate about the need to change the way the country cares for its elderly population. Critics argue that the vulnerabilities of nursing homes go beyond just housing older people in close quarters and that there are long-standing issues such as limited resources, poor government support, and underpaid staff that need to be addressed. There are calls for a radical shift towards at-home care for seniors, supported by government funding, new technology, and community members. This, experts say, would allow nursing homes to focus on those with intensive health needs. While some argue that this restructuring could disadvantage poor people and people of color, others counter that these issues can be mitigated through increased funding, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability. The aging population in the US is expected to nearly double by 2050, underscoring the urgency to improve the current system and find solutions that prioritize the care and support of the elderly.
