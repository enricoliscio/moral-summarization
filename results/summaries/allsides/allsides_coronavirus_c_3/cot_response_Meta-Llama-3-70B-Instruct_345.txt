SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating flaws in the US nursing home system, where at least 54,000 residents and workers have died. The vulnerable elderly population, combined with limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight, has led to substandard care. The fatality rate for nursing home residents who contract the virus is more than three times the national average. Experts argue that a better plan would be to increase at-home care for seniors, which is cheaper and leads to better health outcomes. However, others warn that a massive restructuring of elder care could leave behind poor people and people of color. The government needs to take extraordinary action to address these issues and prepare for a major spike in the elderly population. END OF SUMMARY.
