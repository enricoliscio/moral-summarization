Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I have to identify the morally framed words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes, highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly. Words like "vulnerable," "flaws," "problems," "substandard care," "equitable," "catalyst," "ignore," "silver linings," and "adapting" seem to carry moral implications. These words suggest issues with the system, the need for change, and the consequences of inaction.

Now, for the summary. I need to condense the information, focusing on the key points: high death rates in nursing homes, the flaws in the system, debates about restructuring care, and the need for government intervention. I should include the moral terms identified to maintain the author's framing.

I'll start by mentioning the high death toll, then discuss the systemic issues, followed by the debate over solutions, and conclude with the call for change. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise but include all necessary points.

**SUMMARY:**

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of elderly care facilities in the U.S., with nursing homes accounting for over 40% of COVID-19 deaths despite housing less than 1% of the population. The high fatality rate among residents highlights systemic flaws, including limited resources, underpaid staff, and poor oversight. Critics argue that restructuring elder care to focus on at-home support, funded by the government and supported by technology, could improve outcomes. However, others warn that such changes might leave behind marginalized groups, emphasizing the need for equitable solutions. The pandemic has forced attention on a long-ignored issue, prompting calls for systemic reform to better adapt to the growing elderly population. END OF SUMMARY.
