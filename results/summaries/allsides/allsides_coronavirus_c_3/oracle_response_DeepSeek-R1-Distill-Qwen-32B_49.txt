Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. I'll start by reading the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the high number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes in the U.S., highlighting that nursing home residents account for over 40% of the deaths despite making up less than 1% of the population. It points out flaws in the nursing home system, such as limited resources, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. Experts suggest moving towards at-home care as a solution, but others worry this might leave behind poorer communities and people of color. There's a debate about whether to fix the current system or restructure elder care.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes the morally framed words: changing, support, oversight, care, outcomes, supporting, leave, fixed, fund, action, change, ignore. I'll structure the summary to touch on each of these points, ensuring they're integrated naturally.

I'll start by mentioning the high death toll and the moral issues highlighted. Then discuss the proposed solutions, like at-home care and funding. I'll also address the concerns about leaving vulnerable groups behind. Finally, I'll tie it all together by emphasizing the need for action and change, not ignoring the problem.

Let me draft the summary, making sure it's concise and within 200 words. I'll check that all the key moral points are covered and that the words are preserved as per the user's request.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed critical flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, with at least 54,000 residents dying from the virus. Nursing homes account for over 40% of COVID-19 deaths, despite residents making up less than 1% of the population. Experts argue that the system's vulnerabilities, such as limited resources, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight, require radical change. Proposals include shifting to at-home care supported by government funding and technology, which could improve health outcomes and reduce strain on nursing homes. However, critics warn that such a change could leave behind poorer communities and people of color, who may lack the resources for at-home care. Others advocate for fixing the current system through increased funding, better staff pay, and equitable healthcare. The pandemic has forced society to confront these issues, highlighting the need for action to address the moral failures and support the aging population effectively. END OF SUMMARY.
