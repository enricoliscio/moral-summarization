SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, with at least 54,000 residents and workers dying from the virus. The elderly are especially vulnerable, making up more than three-quarters of America's coronavirus deaths. Critics argue that the system's problems, including limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight, have contributed to the devastating outbreaks. To address these issues, some experts propose a radical change in the way the country cares for the elderly, shifting the focus to at-home care supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. However, others warn that a massive restructuring of elder care could leave behind poor people and people of color, who may not have access to stable housing and financial support. Instead, they advocate for more funding for care and staff pay, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability to fix the current system.
