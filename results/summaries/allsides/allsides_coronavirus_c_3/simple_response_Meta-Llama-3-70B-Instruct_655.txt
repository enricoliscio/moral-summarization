SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, with at least 54,000 residents and workers dying from the virus. The elderly are disproportionately affected, with those over 65 making up more than three-quarters of America's coronavirus deaths. The high fatality rate in nursing homes is attributed to limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. Experts argue that the system needs a radical overhaul, with some advocating for a shift towards at-home care supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. However, others warn that such a restructuring could leave behind poor and minority communities who may not have access to stable housing and resources for at-home care. The pandemic has highlighted the need for a more equitable and sustainable approach to elder care.
