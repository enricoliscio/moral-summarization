Okay, so I need to help the user with their query. They want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a given news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. 

First, I should break down the user's instructions. They have two main steps. The first is to identify all the single words that are morally framed. They want this step labeled as "STEP 1:" and each word listed with an asterisk. The second step is to write a summary, making sure to include as many of those morally framed words as possible. The summary needs to be concise, no longer than 200 words, and properly formatted with "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY."

Looking at the news article, it's about the high number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and the debate over the U.S. elder care system. The author presents various perspectives on the issue, highlighting flaws in the current system and suggesting alternatives like increased home care. 

For STEP 1, I need to find words that carry moral connotations. Words like "devastating," "vulnerable," "flaws," "critics," "problems," "underpaid," "lack," "substandard," "strain," "equitable," "catalyst," "silver linings," "ignore," "alternatives," and "adapting." These words reflect the moral judgment or evaluation in the text.

Now, for the summary, I need to encapsulate the main points while including these morally framed words. I should mention the high death toll, the flaws in the nursing home system, the arguments for home care, and the potential issues with restructuring. I also need to include the perspectives from the experts and the possible solutions they suggest.

I should ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the problem, moving to the debate, and then the proposed solutions. It's important to highlight the moral aspects, such as the vulnerability of the elderly, the flaws in the system, and the need for equitable solutions.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I have to be concise but comprehensive. I'll structure it by first stating the problem, then the debate, followed by the proposed solutions, and end with the need for adapting to the aging population.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the morally framed words and keep it within the word limit.

**SUMMARY:**  
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the devastating impact on nursing home residents, with over 54,000 deaths in the U.S., highlighting flaws in the elder care system. Nursing homes, with their vulnerable populations and limited resources, have been particularly hard-hit. Critics argue that long-standing issues like underpaid staff, poor oversight, and financial incentives for substandard care have exacerbated the crisis. As the elderly population grows, experts propose shifting to at-home care, supported by technology and community efforts, to reduce strain on nursing homes. However, others warn that restructuring elder care could leave behind marginalized communities. Calls for equitable funding, better staff pay, and government accountability aim to address these moral challenges. The pandemic may serve as a catalyst for change, urging a more thoughtful approach to aging in the U.S.
