SUMMARY: At least 54,000 residents and workers in U.S. nursing homes and other elder-care facilities have died from COVID-19, according to data from late June. This accounts for more than 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the country's population. The high death toll in nursing homes has brought to light long-standing issues within the industry, such as limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and financial structures that prioritize profit over quality care. As the population of older individuals is expected to grow significantly by 2050, there are calls for a radical shift in how the country cares for its elderly. Some experts argue for a major increase in at-home care supported by government funding, technology, and community resources. This could not only provide better health outcomes but also allow nursing homes to focus on those with more intensive health needs. However, others caution that such a restructuring could disadvantage low-income individuals and people of color, who may not have the necessary resources to support at-home care. They advocate for improvements within the current system through increased funding, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities and moral failings within the U.S. nursing home system, and there is a pressing need for ethical and sustainable solutions to ensure the well-being of the country's elderly population.
