SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, resulting in devastating outbreaks and a disproportionately high number of deaths among the elderly. With over 54,000 residents and workers having lost their lives, the crisis has highlighted the need for radical change in the way the country cares for its elderly population. Experts argue that the current system is plagued by limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and a lack of oversight, which has led to substandard care. To address this, some propose a shift towards at-home care, supported by government funds, new technology, and community members, which could lead to better health outcomes and cost savings. Others caution that such a shift could leave behind vulnerable populations, such as the poor and people of color, and instead advocate for increased funding for care and staff pay, as well as a more equitable healthcare system.
