SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, resulting in devastating outbreaks and a staggering 54,000 deaths. The elderly population, making up less than 1% of the country's population, accounts for over 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths. Experts argue that the system's vulnerabilities stem from limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight, leading to substandard care. To address this, some propose a radical change in the way the country cares for the elderly, shifting the majority of elder care to at-home care supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. However, others warn that such a restructuring could leave behind poor people and people of color, who may not have access to stable housing and resources for at-home care. The government must take action to support and fund care for seniors, ensuring that no one is left behind.
