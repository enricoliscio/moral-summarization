SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the flaws in the United States' nursing home system, with at least 54,000 residents and workers dying from the virus. The high death toll has sparked a debate about the need to change the way the country cares for its elderly population. Experts argue that the issues in nursing homes are not just due to the vulnerability of older people but also because of long-standing problems like limited resources, poor government support, low staff pay, lack of oversight, and financial structures that prioritize profit over quality care. There is a growing call for a shift towards at-home care for seniors, supported by government funding, new technology, and community initiatives. This model is believed to be more cost-effective and lead to better health outcomes. Proponents of this change argue that it would allow nursing homes to focus on those with intensive health needs, while also providing the dignity and comfort of aging in a familiar environment. However, critics worry that a restructuring of elder care could disadvantage low-income individuals and people of color, who may not have the resources to support at-home care. They suggest that improvements can be made within the current system through increased funding, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability to ensure safe and quality care for all. The pandemic has brought the issues in elder care into sharp focus, and there is a growing consensus that action is needed to change and improve the system to better support the aging population.
