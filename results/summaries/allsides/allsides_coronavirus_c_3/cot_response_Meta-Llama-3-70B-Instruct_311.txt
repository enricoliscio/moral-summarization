SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, where at least 54,000 residents and workers have died. The elderly are especially vulnerable to the virus, and the system's limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight have contributed to the high fatality rate. To address these flaws, experts argue that a radical change is needed, such as shifting the focus to at-home care, which is cheaper and leads to better health outcomes. However, others argue that this could leave behind poor people and people of color, who may not have access to stable housing and funding for at-home care. A more equitable healthcare system and increased government accountability are needed to ensure that the elderly receive the care they deserve. END OF SUMMARY.
