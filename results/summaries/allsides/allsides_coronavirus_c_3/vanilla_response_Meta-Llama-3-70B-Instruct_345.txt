SUMMARY:

At least 54,000 residents and workers at nursing homes and other elder-care facilities have died of COVID-19 in the United States, according to data compiled by the New York Times. This accounts for more than 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the country's population. The high fatality rate is attributed to the age of residents, communal living, and long-standing problems such as limited resources, poor government support, and underpaid staff. Experts argue that the crisis highlights the need for radical change in the US nursing home system, with some advocating for a shift towards at-home care supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. Others propose increasing funding for care and staff pay, and promoting a more equitable healthcare system. The country's aging population, expected to nearly double by 2050, adds urgency to the need for reform.
