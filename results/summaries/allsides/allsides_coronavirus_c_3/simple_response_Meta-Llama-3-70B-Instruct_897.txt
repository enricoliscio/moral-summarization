SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, resulting in devastating outbreaks and a staggering 54,000 deaths among residents and workers. The elderly are disproportionately affected, with those over 65 accounting for more than three-quarters of America's coronavirus deaths. Experts argue that the system's vulnerabilities, including limited resources, poor government support, and underpaid staff, have contributed to the crisis. To address this, some propose a radical shift towards at-home care, supported by government funds, technology, and community members, which could lead to better health outcomes and cost savings. Others caution that such a shift could leave behind poor and minority communities, and instead advocate for increased funding, staff pay, and government accountability to fix the existing system. The moral imperative is clear: the US must reexamine its approach to elder care and prioritize the well-being and dignity of its most vulnerable citizens.
