Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about how COVID-19 has affected nursing homes in the U.S. It mentions that over 54,000 residents and workers have died, which is a significant number. The U.S. has more nursing home deaths than any country except Brazil. Elderly people are especially vulnerable, making up 75% of all COVID deaths. The article also talks about the reasons behind these high numbers, like crowded living spaces, limited resources, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. 

There's a debate about whether the nursing home system needs a radical change, maybe shifting towards home care. Some experts argue that home care is cheaper and better for health outcomes, but others worry that this might leave behind poorer communities. They suggest improving funding and staff conditions instead. 

The perspectives mentioned include the need for government support for home care, addressing ongoing issues in nursing homes, using technology for home care, and preparing for a growing elderly population. 

I should make sure the summary includes the main points: high death toll, reasons for vulnerability, debate on changing the system, and different perspectives. I'll keep it under 200 words, starting with the key statistics, then the reasons, followed by the debate and perspectives. Make sure to end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 54,000 deaths in U.S. nursing homes, accounting for over 40% of the nation's coronavirus fatalities. Nursing homes, with their elderly populations and communal living, have been particularly vulnerable. Critics argue that systemic issues like limited resources, underpaid staff, and poor oversight exacerbate the problem. Some propose shifting elderly care to home-based models, supported by technology and community efforts, to reduce nursing home strain. Others warn that this could disadvantage marginalized groups and suggest improving funding and staff conditions instead. The pandemic has highlighted the need for a restructured elder care system as the U.S. prepares for a doubling of its elderly population by 2050. END OF SUMMARY.
