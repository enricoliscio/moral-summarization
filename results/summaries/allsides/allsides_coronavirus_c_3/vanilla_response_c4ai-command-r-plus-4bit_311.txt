SUMMARY: At least 54,000 residents and workers in U.S. nursing homes and other elder care facilities have died from COVID-19, according to data from the New York Times. The virus has exposed flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, with critics pointing to long-standing issues such as limited resources, poor government support, and underpaid staff. The debate surrounds whether the system should be reformed or replaced with a focus on at-home care. Some argue that at-home care, supported by government funds, new technology, and community members, could provide better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. Others caution that a restructuring of elder care could disadvantage low-income individuals and people of color who may not have the resources to support at-home care. Advocates for reform argue that increasing funding for care and staff pay, improving healthcare equity, and holding the government accountable could address many of the current system's issues. The aging U.S. population underscores the urgency to adapt and improve elder care systems.
