SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the flaws in the nursing home system in the United States, with at least 54,000 deaths recorded in these facilities as of late June. The high death toll has prompted experts to call for a radical change in the way the country cares for its elderly population. The issues are not just the result of housing older people in close quarters but also long-standing problems such as limited resources, poor government support, low staff pay, a lack of oversight, and financial structures that prioritize profit over quality care. There is a growing consensus that a shift to at-home care for seniors, supported by government funding, new technology, and community members, could provide a better solution. This would not only be cheaper and lead to better health outcomes but also allow nursing homes to focus on those with intensive health needs. However, some argue that such a massive restructuring could disadvantage poor people and people of color who may not have the necessary resources to support at-home care. They suggest that improvements to the current system, such as increased funding and staff pay, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability, could address many of the issues. The pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for action and change to protect the elderly and ensure their well-being.
