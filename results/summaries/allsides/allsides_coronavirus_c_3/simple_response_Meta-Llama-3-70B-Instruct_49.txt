SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, with at least 54,000 residents and workers having died from the virus. The elderly are disproportionately affected, with those over 65 making up more than three-quarters of America's coronavirus deaths. Critics argue that the system's vulnerabilities are due to limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and financial structures that incentivize substandard care. To address this, some experts propose a radical change in the way the country cares for the elderly, shifting the majority of elder care to at-home care supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. However, others warn that such a restructuring could leave behind poor people and people of color who may not have access to stable housing and necessary resources.
