Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article talks about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and the debate around elder care in the U.S. The user provided a list of morally framed words to include: changing, support, oversight, care, outcomes, supporting, leave, fixed, fund, action, change, ignore.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It mentions that nursing homes have had a high number of COVID-19 deaths, highlighting systemic issues like limited resources, poor oversight, and underpaid staff. Experts suggest moving towards home care with government funding and technology. However, others worry that this shift might leave behind poorer communities and people of color.

Now, I need to craft a summary that includes as many of those moral words as possible. I'll start by stating the high death toll and the need for change. Then, I'll mention the flaws in the system and the proposed solutions, making sure to use words like support, fund, oversight, care, outcomes, and change. I should also address the counterarguments about leaving vulnerable groups behind, using words like leave and ignore.

I'll structure it to flow logically: problem, proposed solutions, counterarguments, and the need for action. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with a call for change and support.

Let me draft that, ensuring all the key points and moral words are included without making it too long. I'll check each sentence to see if I can incorporate the necessary terms naturally.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerabilities in the U.S. nursing home system, with over 54,000 residents and workers dying from the virus. The high fatality rate highlights systemic issues like limited resources, poor oversight, and underpaid staff. Experts argue that radical change is needed, proposing increased government-funded at-home care supported by technology and community efforts. This shift could improve health outcomes and reduce nursing home strain. However, critics warn that restructuring care might leave behind marginalized groups, as poorer communities and people of color often lack stable housing or funds for home care. To address these flaws, more funding, equitable healthcare, and accountability are essential. The pandemic offers a chance to act, urging a focus on aging at home and supporting vulnerable populations. The debate underscores the need for change and the moral imperative to ensure no one is left behind. END OF SUMMARY.
