SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating flaws in the US nursing home system, where at least 54,000 residents and workers have died. The elderly are especially vulnerable to the virus, and the system's limitations, including poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight, have contributed to the devastating outbreaks. Experts argue that the system needs a radical change, with some advocating for a shift to at-home care, which is cheaper and leads to better health outcomes. Others believe that more funding for care and staff pay, a more equitable healthcare system, and government accountability can fix the issues. The country needs to prepare for a major spike in the elderly population, and the pandemic should prompt us to explore alternative care options, including technology and family support, to ensure a better plan for the elderly.
