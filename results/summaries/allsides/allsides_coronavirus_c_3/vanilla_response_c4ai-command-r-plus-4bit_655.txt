SUMMARY: At least 54,000 residents and workers in U.S. nursing homes and other elder-care facilities have died from COVID-19, according to data from the New York Times. This accounts for more than 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the country's population. The high death toll has brought attention to long-standing issues within the U.S. nursing home system, including limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and financial structures that incentivize substandard care. Experts argue that a radical shift towards at-home care for seniors, supported by government funding, technology, and community members, could be a better alternative. This shift could alleviate the strain on nursing homes and allow them to focus on those with intensive health needs. However, others caution that a restructuring of elder care could disadvantage poor people and people of color who may not have the resources to support at-home care. Improving the current system through increased funding, equitable healthcare, and government accountability is also suggested as a solution.
