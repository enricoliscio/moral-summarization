Alright, so the user has provided a detailed query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They have given a news article and specific instructions on how to summarize it, preserving the moral framing. 

First, I need to understand the task thoroughly. The user wants a summary that's no longer than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." They also specified that I must preserve as many of the morally framed words as possible. These words include changing, support, oversight, care, outcomes, supporting, leave, fixed, fund, action, change, ignore.

Looking at the article, it's about the high number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and the debate on the U.S. elder care system. The moral framing here revolves around systemic issues, the need for change, support, and the ethical implications of current policies.

I need to extract the key points: the statistics on deaths, the reasons behind the vulnerability of nursing homes, the debate on restructuring elder care, and the perspectives on at-home care versus improving nursing homes. I should use the morally charged words to maintain the author's framing.

I'll start by summarizing the data on deaths, then move to the systemic issues in nursing homes. Next, I'll discuss the proposed solutions, ensuring to include terms like 'fund,''support,' 'change,' etc. I'll also touch on the potential downsides of shifting to home care, especially for marginalized groups.

I need to keep the summary concise, making sure each sentence conveys a key point without losing the moral implications. I'll check the word count to stay under 200 words and ensure all specified moral words are included where appropriate.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the problem, moving to the debate, and ending with the perspectives and potential solutions, all while maintaining the moral framing.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed critical flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, with over 54,000 residents and workers dying from the virus as of late June. Nursing homes account for over 40% of COVID-19 deaths, despite housing less than 1% of the population. The high fatality rate highlights systemic issues like limited resources, underpaid staff, and inadequate oversight. Experts argue that radical changes are needed to improve elder care, including increased funding for at-home care supported by technology and community efforts. However, shifting care to homes could leave behind marginalized groups, such as people of color and those living in poverty, who may lack the resources for such support. Others advocate for fixing the current system through better funding, equitable healthcare, and accountability. The pandemic has forced society to confront the often-ignored challenges of aging, urging action to adapt to the growing elderly population and ensure better care outcomes. END OF SUMMARY.
