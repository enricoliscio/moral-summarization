SUMMARY:

According to data compiled by the New York Times, at least 54,000 residents and workers at nursing homes and other elder-care facilities have died of COVID-19 in the United States. This accounts for more than 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the country's population. Experts argue that the high fatality rate is due to flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, including limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. Some propose a shift towards at-home care for seniors, supported by government funds, new technology, and community members, which could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. Others argue that a massive restructuring of elder care could leave behind poor people and people of color, and instead advocate for more funding for care and staff pay, and a more equitable healthcare system.
