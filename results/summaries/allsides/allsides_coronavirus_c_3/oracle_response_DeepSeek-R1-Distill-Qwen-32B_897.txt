Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that should be included in the summary. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article discusses the high number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes in the U.S., noting that it's more than any other country except Brazil. It highlights that the elderly are particularly vulnerable, and nursing homes have struggled due to factors like limited resources, poor oversight, and underpaid staff. The debate is about whether the system needs a radical change, with some suggesting more at-home care supported by the government, while others worry this might leave behind poorer communities. Experts argue that increasing funding and improving healthcare equity could fix the current system.

Now, I need to create a summary that's under 200 words, using as many of the provided moral words as possible: changing, support, oversight, care, outcomes, supporting, leave, fixed, fund, action, change, ignore.

I should structure the summary to include the main points: high death rates, reasons for vulnerability, the debate on restructuring elder care, the potential benefits and drawbacks, and the need for government action. I'll make sure to incorporate the moral terms naturally.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and includes the key moral elements. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and make sure the summary flows logically.

SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed critical flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, with over 54,000 deaths in such facilities, highlighting the need for change. Nursing homes, housing 1.4 million people, account for over 40% of COVID-19 deaths, despite their residents being less than 1% of the population. The high fatality rate is linked to factors like limited resources, poor oversight, and underpaid staff. Experts argue that radical change is needed, including increased funding for at-home care, supported by technology and community efforts, to improve health outcomes. However, some worry that restructuring could leave behind poorer communities and people of color. Others suggest that addressing systemic issues through better funding, equitable healthcare, and accountability could fix the current system. The debate underscores the moral imperative to act, as the aging population grows, and the need to avoid ignoring the plight of the elderly. END OF SUMMARY.
