SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the flaws in the United States' nursing home system, with at least 54,000 residents and workers in elder-care facilities dying from the virus. The high death toll has sparked a debate about the state of nursing homes in the US and the broader issue of how the country cares for its elderly population. Some experts argue that the issues within the nursing home system, such as limited resources, poor government support, and underpaid staff, have been exacerbated by the pandemic and require radical changes. Suggested solutions include a shift towards at-home care for seniors, supported by government funding and new technology, or a more equitable healthcare system with increased funding for care and staff pay. Others caution that a restructuring of elder care could disadvantage low-income individuals and people of color, who may not have the resources to support at-home care. As the elderly population in the US is expected to grow significantly by 2050, there is an urgent need to address these issues and improve the care and support available to seniors.
