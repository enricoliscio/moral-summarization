SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for radical change in the US nursing home system, which has been plagued by long-standing problems such as limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. The devastating outbreaks in these facilities have resulted in over 54,000 deaths, with nursing homes accounting for more than 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths. Experts argue that the current system can only be fixed by shifting the focus to at-home care for seniors, supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach is not only cheaper but also leads to better health outcomes. However, others caution that a massive restructuring of elder care could leave behind poor people and people of color, who may not have access to stable housing and resources to support at-home care. The government needs to take action to fund at-home care and ensure a more equitable healthcare system. END OF SUMMARY.
