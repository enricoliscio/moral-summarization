SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, resulting in at least 54,000 deaths. The elderly are particularly vulnerable, with those over 65 accounting for more than three-quarters of America's coronavirus deaths. The high fatality rate in nursing homes is attributed to limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. To address this, experts suggest a radical change in the way the country cares for the elderly, including a shift towards at-home care supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. However, others argue that a massive restructuring of elder care could leave behind poor people and people of color, who may not have access to stable housing and resources for at-home care. The government needs to take action to fund care and staff pay, and ensure a more equitable healthcare system to support the growing elderly population.
