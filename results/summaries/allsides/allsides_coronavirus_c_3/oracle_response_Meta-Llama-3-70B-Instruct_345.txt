SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, resulting in devastating outbreaks and a staggering 54,000 deaths. The elderly, who make up less than 1% of the population, account for over 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths. Experts argue that the system's vulnerabilities stem from limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, lack of oversight, and financial structures that incentivize substandard care. To address this, some propose a radical change in the way the country cares for the elderly, shifting the focus to at-home care supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. Others argue that a massive restructuring could leave behind poor people and people of color, and instead advocate for increased funding for care and staff pay, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability. The pandemic has highlighted the need for change and support for the elderly, and it is time for the government to take action.
