Alright, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should identify the morally charged words. Let me read through the article again.

The article talks about nursing homes and COVID-19 deaths. Words like "vulnerable," "flaws," "victims," "failure," "underpaid," "substandard," "inequitable," "struggling," "catalyst," "silver lining," "exploit," "burden," "adapting," and "challenges" stand out as they carry moral implications.

Next, I need to create a concise summary using these words. I should make sure the summary reflects the moral concerns about the nursing home system, the impact on vulnerable populations, and the proposed solutions. I'll structure it to highlight the issues, the debate, and the perspectives mentioned, ensuring the moral framing is clear and preserved.

**SUMMARY:**
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of the U.S. nursing home system, with over 54,000 residents dying from the virus. This highlights systemic flaws, including limited resources, underpaid staff, and substandard care. Critics argue that the current system, which accounts for over 40% of COVID-19 deaths, is failing the elderly. Some propose shifting to at-home care, supported by technology and government funding, to reduce the burden on nursing homes. However, others warn this could leave vulnerable populations, like people of color and the poor, behind. The debate underscores the need for equitable healthcare, increased funding, and accountability. The pandemic may serve as a catalyst for change, prompting a reevaluation of how the U.S. cares for its aging population. END OF SUMMARY.
