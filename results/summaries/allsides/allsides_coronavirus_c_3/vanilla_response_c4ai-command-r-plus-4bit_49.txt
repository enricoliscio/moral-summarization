SUMMARY: At least 54,000 residents and workers in U.S. nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have died from COVID-19, according to data compiled by the New York Times in late June. The high death toll has brought attention to longstanding issues within the nursing home system, including limited resources, poor government support, and underpaid staff. Experts argue that the current system is inadequate for the growing elderly population in the U.S. and that a radical shift towards at-home care supported by government funding, new technology, and community members is needed. Critics of this idea argue that a massive restructuring of elder care could disadvantage poor people and people of color who may not have the resources to support at-home care. They suggest that issues with the current system can be addressed through increased funding, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability. The debate revolves around how the U.S. can best care for its aging population, particularly in light of the devastating impact of COVID-19 on nursing homes.
