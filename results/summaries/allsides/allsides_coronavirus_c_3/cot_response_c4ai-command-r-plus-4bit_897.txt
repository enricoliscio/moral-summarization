SUMMARY: 
In the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws and vulnerabilities in the nursing home system, leading to devastating outbreaks and a high number of fatalities among the elderly. Critics argue that the issues go beyond the virus, highlighting long-standing problems such as limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, lack of oversight, and financial structures that incentivize substandard care. The current system is already strained and struggling to meet the needs of an aging population expected to nearly double by 2050. 

There are calls for a better plan and radical changes to elder care. Some experts advocate for a major increase in at-home care supported by government funds, technology, and community members. This shift could allow nursing homes to focus on those with intensive health needs while providing stable housing and care for those who might otherwise be left behind, such as the poor and people of color. Others argue that the current system can be improved through more funding, equitable healthcare, and greater government accountability, ensuring that the moral imperative of caring for the elderly is met without leaving anyone behind.
