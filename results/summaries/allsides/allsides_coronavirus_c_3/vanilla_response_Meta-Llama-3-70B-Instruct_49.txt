SUMMARY:

At least 54,000 residents and workers at nursing homes and other elder-care facilities have died of COVID-19 in the United States, according to data compiled by the New York Times. This accounts for more than 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the country's population. The high fatality rate is attributed to the age of residents, communal living, and underlying issues such as limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. Experts argue that the crisis highlights flaws in the US nursing home system, which can only be fixed by radically changing the way the country cares for the elderly. Some propose a shift towards at-home care, while others argue that more funding and government accountability can fix the current system. The issue is pressing, as the US older population is expected to nearly double by 2050.
