SUMMARY:

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the flaws in the US nursing home system, resulting in devastating outbreaks and a staggering 54,000 deaths among residents and workers. The elderly are disproportionately affected, with those over 65 accounting for more than three-quarters of America's coronavirus deaths. Experts argue that the system's vulnerabilities, including limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight, have contributed to the crisis. To address this, some propose a radical shift towards at-home care for seniors, supported by government funds, new technology, and community members. This approach could lead to better health outcomes and be more cost-effective. However, others warn that such a restructuring could leave behind poor people and people of color, who may not have access to stable housing and financial resources. Ultimately, the pandemic has highlighted the need for a more equitable and sustainable approach to elder care.
