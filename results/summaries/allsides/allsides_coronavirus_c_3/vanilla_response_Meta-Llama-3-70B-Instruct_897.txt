SUMMARY:

At least 54,000 residents and workers at nursing homes and other elder-care facilities have died of COVID-19 in the United States, according to data compiled by the New York Times. This accounts for more than 40% of America's COVID-19 deaths, despite nursing home residents making up less than 1% of the country's population. Experts argue that the coronavirus has highlighted flaws in the U.S. nursing home system, including limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight. Some propose a major increase in at-home care for seniors, supported by government funds, new technology, and community members, which could lead to better health outcomes and be cheaper. Others argue that a massive restructuring of elder care could leave behind poor people and people of color, and that the current system can be fixed through more funding and government accountability.
