SUMMARY:
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the devastating flaws in the US nursing home system, where at least 54,000 residents and workers have died. The elderly are especially vulnerable to the virus, and the communal spaces have led to devastating outbreaks. Critics argue that the system's flaws, including limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, and lack of oversight, have contributed to the high fatality rate. To address this, some experts propose a major increase in at-home care for seniors, supported by government funds, new technology, and community members, which could lead to better health outcomes and be cheaper. Others argue that more funding for care and staff pay, a more equitable healthcare system, and government accountability could fix the issues. The country needs to prepare for a major spike in the elderly population and adapt to this new reality. END OF SUMMARY.
