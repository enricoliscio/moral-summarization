SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the flaws in the United States' nursing home system, with at least 54,000 deaths connected to these facilities. The high death toll has sparked a debate about the way the country cares for its elderly population. Some experts argue that the issues within the nursing home system are not solely due to the virus but also a result of long-standing problems such as limited resources, poor government support, and underpaid staff. There is a growing call for a radical change in the approach to elder care, with a focus on increasing at-home care supported by government funding, new technology, and community members. This shift could alleviate the strain on nursing homes and allow them to focus on those with intensive health needs. However, others caution that a restructuring of elder care could disadvantage people of color and those with lower incomes. They suggest that improvements can be made within the current system through increased funding, a more equitable healthcare system, and greater government accountability. The pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing the issues within the nursing home system and preparing for the growing elderly population in the US.
