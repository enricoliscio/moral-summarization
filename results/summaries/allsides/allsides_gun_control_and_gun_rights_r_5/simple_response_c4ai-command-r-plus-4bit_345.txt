SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a fortune of his personal wealth on his national crusade to ban guns, yet he has had to rely on stop-and-frisk policing tactics to get illegal firearms off the streets. Now that a federal judge has deemed the tactic unconstitutional and racial profiling, the City Council has overridden his veto of bills that will curtail the practice. Bloomberg argues that minorities will suffer most from the decision, as they have benefited most from the tactic's crime-reducing effects. While Bloomberg blames the NRA for all evils, the organization has no official stance on stop-and-frisk and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have failed to reduce crime. The focus should be on enforcing laws that target criminals, not on restricting law-abiding citizens' Second Amendment rights. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling against stop-and-frisk, and Bloomberg should respect the rights of responsible gun owners.
END OF SUMMARY.
