Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to implement gun control and his use of stop-and-frisk tactics. It mentions the City Council overriding his veto, which he claims will put minorities at higher risk. The author seems critical of Bloomberg, pointing out that his policies haven't stopped criminals but have led to invasive tactics. There's also a mention of the legal challenges and the NRA's role, which the author downplays.

I need to identify the morally framed words the author used and include as many as possible in the summary. Words like "instituted," "stopped," "blame," "overrode," "protecting," "wrong," etc., are key here. The summary should reflect the author's stance, which seems to support Bloomberg's methods but criticize his linking to the NRA and the Council's decision.

I should structure the summary to cover Bloomberg's policies, the Council's action, the legal ruling, and the debate around stop-and-frisk and NRA involvement. Keeping it under 200 words is crucial, so I'll need to be concise but include the moral elements.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it flows logically and includes the necessary moral terms. I'll make sure to highlight the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, the Council's override, Bloomberg's arguments, and the criticism of his linking to the NRA. Also, mention the author's view on the NRA's stance and the legal implications.

Finally, I'll check the word count to ensure it's within the limit and that all key points are covered with the appropriate moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions promoting gun control measures and using stop-and-frisk tactics to reduce crime, though critics argue these methods have disproportionately targeted minorities. The City Council recently overrode Bloomberg’s veto to create an inspector general for the NYPD and allow lawsuits for racial profiling, a move Bloomberg claims will put minorities at higher risk. A federal judge ruled stop-and-frisk violated the Fourth Amendment, calling it racial profiling, but Bloomberg insists it has saved lives by taking thousands of illegal guns off the streets and cutting the murder rate in half. Conservatives, like Mike Long, support the tactic, arguing it makes NYC safer, while Bloomberg blames the NRA for opposing gun control. The author criticizes Bloomberg for linking the NRA to lawsuits and dismisses claims that NRA advocacy for law-abiding gun owners leads to more deaths. The NRA has not officially supported or opposed stop-and-frisk but advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. The article questions the effectiveness of Bloomberg’s broader gun control agenda and argues the federal appeals court should overturn the ruling, calling it racist. The author also faults Bloomberg for his disgust toward law-abiding gun owners. END OF SUMMARY.
