SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's efforts to ban guns have been thwarted by the City Council's override of his veto on two bills that will create a police inspector general and allow more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, citing the success of stop-and-frisk tactics in reducing crime and taking 8,000 illegal guns off the streets. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's real agenda is to restrict law-abiding gun owners, and that his tactics are "racist" and "absurd." The NRA, often blamed by Bloomberg, actually advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Meanwhile, the city's "stop-question-frisk" program has been ruled a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and Bloomberg's attempts to link the NRA to the plaintiffs have been met with skepticism.
