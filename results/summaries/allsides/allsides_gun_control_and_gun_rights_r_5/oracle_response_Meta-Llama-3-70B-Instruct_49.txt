SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to institute gun bans have been thwarted, despite his claims that they have stopped criminals from getting guns. Instead, he has resorted to policing tactics like stop and frisk to take illegal guns away from bad guys. However, his success in this area is no longer allowed, and he's looking for someone to blame. The City Council overrode his veto of two bills that will create a NYPD inspector general to oversee tactics like stop and frisk and allow more categories of people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, but critics argue that his stop and frisk program has been a violation of the Fourth Amendment and racial profiling. Bloomberg's real motive is to protect his ideology against guns, not to protect citizens. He's wrong to link the NRA to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits and to claim that defending law-abiding gun owners leads to more innocent deaths. The NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for possession of illegal guns, which has been proven to make cities safer. END OF SUMMARY.
