SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's gun control efforts have been thwarted by the City Council's override of his veto on two bills that will create a police inspector general and allow more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, as stop and frisk has resulted in 8,000 illegal guns being taken off the streets and a 50% reduction in the murder rate. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's real agenda is to restrict law-abiding gun owners, citing his tough gun laws that have not reduced crime. The NRA, often demonized as a "bogeyman," has never taken a stance on stop and frisk and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's attempts to link the NRA to the plaintiffs in the federal lawsuits are seen as a false and absurd move. END OF SUMMARY.
