SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions of dollars trying to institute his gun bans in the rest of America, despite their ineffectiveness in stopping criminals from obtaining firearms. As a result, he has relied on policing tactics like stop and frisk to get guns off the streets. However, his efforts have been met with resistance, as the City Council recently overrode his veto of two bills that will create an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk tactics and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that these decisions will put minorities at higher risk and increase the risk of crime. He points to the success of stop and frisk in reducing the murder rate and confiscating illegal guns. However, critics argue that stop and frisk is a violation of the Fourth Amendment and targets blacks and Hispanics disproportionately. The NRA, despite being blamed by Bloomberg for the world's evils, has no official position on stop-and-frisk policies. The association between defending gun rights and increased innocent deaths is also unsupported. The true method to making cities safer lies in checking likely criminals for illegal firearms and tougher sentencing for possession of illicit guns. Bloomberg's other national agenda items, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have failed to reduce crime. The author calls for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against taking illegal guns from criminals and for Bloomberg to hide his disgust for law-abiding gun owners.
