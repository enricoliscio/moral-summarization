SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to defend the city's "stop and frisk" program have been thwarted by the City Council, which overrode his veto of two bills that will create a police inspector general and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims that the program has taken 8,000 illegal guns off the streets and cut the murder rate in half, but critics argue that it is a form of racial profiling. The mayor has also tried to link the National Rifle Association (NRA) to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits, claiming that they share an ideology that prioritizes gun rights over public safety. However, the NRA has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession.

END OF SUMMARY.
