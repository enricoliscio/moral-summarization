SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to curb gun violence through gun control laws and controversial stop-and-frisk tactics face opposition. The City Council overridden his veto of bills creating an NYPD inspector general and allowing more racial profiling lawsuits. Bloomberg argues that stop-and-frisk has reduced crime and saved lives, especially in minority communities. However, a federal judge ruled it violates the Fourth Amendment and targets blacks and Hispanics disproportionately. Bloomberg's criticism of the NRA and gun control advocates is questioned, as tougher sentences for illegal gun possession, not gun control laws, have proven effective in reducing crime. The NRA supports enforcing laws to prosecute criminals, and stop-and-frisk is a complex issue for Second Amendment advocates. The article argues that the ruling against stop-and-frisk is absurd and that Bloomberg's disdain for law-abiding gun owners is misguided.
