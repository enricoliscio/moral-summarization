Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should try to include. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about NYC Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to implement gun bans and his use of stop-and-frisk tactics. The City Council overrode his veto, creating an inspector general and allowing lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that this will put minorities at higher risk because they've benefited from crime reduction. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, but Bloomberg plans to appeal, claiming it's saved lives. There's criticism from the NRA and others about his tactics and linking the NRA to the plaintiffs. The author seems critical of Bloomberg's approach, suggesting he's overstepping and not addressing the real issues.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. Words like "instituted," "stopped," "away," "blame," "overrode," "veto," "allow," "put," "reduction," "taken," "cut," "safer," "saved," "making," "like," "blaming," "link," "protecting," "trump," "wrong," "against," "fight," "remain," "die," "gives," "defending," "law-abiding," "association," "impression," "go," "grabbing," "crime," "checking," "method," "sentencing," "possession," "enforcing," "prosecuting," "having," "reduced," "overturn," "ruling," "taking," "harder," "disgust."

I'll structure the summary by highlighting Bloomberg's actions, the council's override, the judge's ruling, the impact on crime, and the criticism from various groups. I'll make sure to use the moral words to convey the author's perspective.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's under 200 words and includes as many of the listed words as possible without making it sound forced. I'll start with Bloomberg's efforts, then the council's action, the legal issues, the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, the NRA's stance, and the overall criticism.

I should also maintain the tone, which seems to be critical of Bloomberg's methods and his linking to the NRA. The author questions the effectiveness of gun bans and supports law enforcement methods like stop-and-frisk. So, the summary should reflect that the author believes Bloomberg is overstepping and that the real issue is enforcing existing laws, not just passing more.

I need to make sure each sentence includes the moral words naturally. For example, "Bloomberg has spent millions trying to institute stricter gun laws" uses "institute." Then, "Despite these efforts, criminals have stopped from obtaining guns" uses "stopped." Wait, but "stopped" might not fit perfectly. Maybe "Despite these efforts, criminals have not been stopped from obtaining guns."

I'll continue this process, ensuring each key point is covered with the appropriate moral framing words. I'll check the word count to stay within 200 words.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with Bloomberg's actions, the council's override, the legal ruling, the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, the NRA's position, and the criticism of Bloomberg's approach. This should encapsulate the main points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions trying to institute stricter gun laws nationwide, despite their failure to stop criminals from obtaining firearms. He resorted to stop-and-frisk tactics, which have been credited with reducing crime and saving lives, particularly in minority communities. However, the City Council recently overrode his veto, creating an inspector general to oversee such tactics and allowing lawsuits for racial profiling. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, targeting minorities, but Bloomberg plans to appeal, claiming it has made the city safer and cut the murder rate. Critics argue that Bloomberg's focus on blaming the NRA and others distracts from enforcing existing laws, like tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. The NRA, while advocating for law-abiding gun owners, has not officially supported or opposed stop-and-frisk. The author questions Bloomberg's tactics, suggesting they put minorities at higher risk and ignore proven methods to reduce crime. END OF SUMMARY.
