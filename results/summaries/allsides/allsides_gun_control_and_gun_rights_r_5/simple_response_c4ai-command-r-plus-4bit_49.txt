SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a fortune of his own money to institute gun control measures in the US, despite their ineffectiveness in reducing crime. Bloomberg's only successful tactic, "stop and frisk," has been deemed unconstitutional and racially biased. The mayor claims that the ruling will put minorities at risk and has vowed to appeal, citing the success of the program in reducing the murder rate and confiscating illegal guns. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's efforts are misguided and that his disdain for law-abiding gun owners is misplaced. The NRA, often blamed for gun-related issues, has never taken a stance on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for stricter sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have also failed to reduce crime. The article concludes that the ruling against "stop and frisk" is absurd and that Bloomberg's efforts to reduce gun violence are ineffective and disrespectful towards law-abiding citizens.
