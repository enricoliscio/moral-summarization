Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about NYC Mayor Bloomberg's gun control efforts, specifically the stop-and-frisk policy. The City Council overrode his veto to create an inspector general and allow lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that this will put minorities at higher risk, but others, like Mike Long, support the policy for reducing crime. The author also criticizes the NRA and the ACLU, suggesting they're not as connected to the stop-and-frisk issue as Bloomberg claims. 

I need to highlight the moral aspects. Words like "instituted," "stopped," "blame," "overrode," "allow," "saved," "wrong," "protecting," "die," etc., should be included. I should structure the summary to show Bloomberg's perspective and the counterarguments, making sure to use those moral terms.

I'll start by mentioning Bloomberg's efforts and the City Council's action. Then, I'll note his claims about safety and minorities. Include the judge's ruling and the appeal. Highlight the support for stop-and-frisk and the NRA's stance. Conclude with the author's criticism of the ruling and Bloomberg's approach.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include the key moral points. Let me draft it step by step, ensuring each sentence uses the appropriate moral framing words without making it too long.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions trying to institute stricter gun laws nationwide, despite their failure to stop criminals from obtaining firearms. His reliance on stop-and-frisk tactics has been controversial, as it disproportionately targets minorities. The City Council recently overrode Bloomberg's veto, allowing an inspector general to oversee such policing tactics and enabling more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this decision puts minorities at higher risk, arguing they have benefited most from crime reduction. However, a federal judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, calling it racial profiling. Bloomberg, who credits the policy with reducing crime and saving lives, vows to appeal, dismissing precedents from other courts. Supporters like Mike Long argue stop-and-frisk has made NYC safer, while critics accuse Bloomberg of blaming the NRA for unrelated issues. The author condemns the ruling as racist and criticizes Bloomberg for his disgust toward law-abiding gun owners, emphasizing that tougher sentencing, not bans, reduces crime. END OF SUMMARY.
