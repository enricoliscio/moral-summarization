SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to institute gun bans have been thwarted, despite his claims that they reduce crime. Instead, he has resorted to stop-and-frisk tactics, which have been deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge. Bloomberg blames the National Rifle Association (NRA) for his failures, but critics argue that he is wrong to link the NRA to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits. The mayor's own agenda against guns and the NRA is clear, and his tactics have been called into question. The NRA, meanwhile, advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession and has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies. Bloomberg's efforts to reduce crime have been successful, but his methods have been deemed racist and unconstitutional. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling, and Bloomberg should re-examine his approach to reducing crime.

END OF SUMMARY.
