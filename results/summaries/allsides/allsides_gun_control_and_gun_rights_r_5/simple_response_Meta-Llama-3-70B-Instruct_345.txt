SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun control efforts have been thwarted by the City Council's override of his veto on two bills that will create a police inspector general and allow more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, despite his own policing tactics, such as stop and frisk, being deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge. The mayor's appeal cites the program's success in removing 8,000 illegal guns from the streets and halving the murder rate. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's real agenda is to restrict gun ownership, not reduce crime. The NRA, often blamed by Bloomberg, has never taken a stance on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. The author argues that Bloomberg's efforts are misguided and that the federal appeals court should overturn the ruling, allowing police to continue removing illegal guns from criminals.
