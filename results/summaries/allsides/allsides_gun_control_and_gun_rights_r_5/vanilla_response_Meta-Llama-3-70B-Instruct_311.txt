SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to ban guns and implement stop-and-frisk policies have been met with opposition. The City Council recently overrode his veto of two bills that will create a police inspector general and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, as they have benefited most from crime reduction. This comes after a federal judge ruled that the city's "Stop-Question-Frisk" program was a violation of the Fourth Amendment and racial profiling. Bloomberg has appealed the decision, citing that the program has taken 8,000 illegal guns off the streets and cut the murder rate in half. Critics argue that Bloomberg's gun control efforts are misguided and that the NRA, a frequent target of his criticism, has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies.
