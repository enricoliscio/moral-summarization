SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has spent a fortune of his own money trying to institute his gun bans across America, despite their ineffectiveness in stopping criminals from obtaining firearms. As a result, he has relied on policing tactics like stop and frisk to get guns off the streets. However, his efforts have been hindered by a recent decision from the City Council to override his veto of two bills that will create an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk tactics and allow more groups to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that this decision will put minorities at higher risk and increase the threat of crime. He plans to appeal a federal judge's ruling that the stop-and-frisk program violates the Fourth Amendment and targets blacks and Hispanics. Bloomberg points to the success of the program in reducing the murder rate and confiscating illegal guns. Others, like Mike Long of the Conservative Party of New York, agree that stop and frisk has made the city safer, especially for people of color. Bloomberg has also targeted the NRA, blaming them for the lawsuits and ignoring their agenda of protecting law-abiding gun owners. The NRA, however, has taken no official position on stop-and-frisk policies. While Bloomberg's other gun control proposals have failed to reduce crime, the stop-and-frisk tactic has proven effective. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling against this tactic, and Bloomberg should respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners.
END OF SUMMARY.
