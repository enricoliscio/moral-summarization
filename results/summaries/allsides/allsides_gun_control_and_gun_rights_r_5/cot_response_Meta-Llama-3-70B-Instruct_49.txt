SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is upset after the City Council overrode his veto of two bills that will create a New York Police Department inspector general to oversee tactics such as stop and frisk, allowing more categories of people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims that this move will put minorities at higher risk, as they have benefited most from crime reduction. He argues that stop and frisk has resulted in 8,000 illegal guns being taken off the streets in the past 10 years and the murder rate being cut in half since he began his three terms. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's real agenda is to restrict gun ownership, citing his attempts to link the National Rifle Association (NRA) to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits. The NRA, often portrayed as a "bogeyman" by liberals, advocates for tougher sentencing for possession of illegal guns, which Bloomberg has conceded is a rightful approach. The debate highlights the moral divide between those who prioritize public safety and those who defend the rights of law-abiding gun owners.
