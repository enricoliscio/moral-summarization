Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll go through the article to understand the main points. It's about Mayor Bloomberg's stance on gun control and the stop-and-frisk policy. He's spent a lot of money trying to implement gun bans, but they haven't stopped criminals. So he uses stop-and-frisk, which has led to a reduction in crime but was recently ruled unconstitutional due to racial profiling. The City Council passed bills to create an inspector general and allow more lawsuits for racial profiling, which Bloomberg opposes, saying it endangers minorities. He's also blaming the NRA for the legal challenges, even though the NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk. The article criticizes the linking of NRA and ACLU as causing more deaths, which isn't supported by evidence. The author seems to support Bloomberg's policies, arguing they make the city safer, and criticizes the ruling as racist. They also mention that other gun control measures haven't reduced crime, so stop-and-frisk is necessary.

Now, for the summary, I need to include the morally framed words. From the article, words like "bans," "stop and frisk," "policing tactics," "success," "blame," "overrode," "inspector general," "tactics," "sue," "racial profiling," "benefited," "higher risk," "judge," "Fourth Amendment," "precedents," "illegal guns," "murder rate," "safest," "lives," "color," "tool," "safest cities," "Chicago," "blaming," "National Rifle Association," "evil," "link," "plaintiffs," "federal lawsuits," "New York Civil Liberties Union," "protecting," "ideology," "right to bear arms," "right to privacy," "trump," "citizens," "walk down," "blown away," "agenda," "toughest restrictions," "out of order," "bogeyman," "unrelated," "defending," "rights," "law-abiding," "gun-owners," "innocent deaths," "false impression," "official position," "advocacy," "prosecuting," "criminals," "enforcing," "law," "minimum prison sentence," "assault-weapon," "high-capacity magazine bans," "background checks," "crime," "absurd ruling," "racist," "disgust," "law-abiding gun owners."

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight Bloomberg's efforts, the legal challenges, the impact on crime, the political moves, and the moral arguments against the rulings and the NRA's role. I need to keep it under 200 words and include as many moral terms as possible.

**Summary:**

Mayor Michael Bloomberg has expended significant resources advocating for gun control and implementing stop-and-frisk policies, which have reduced crime but faced legal challenges. The City Council recently overrode his veto to establish an inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk, sparking accusations of racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this endangers minorities, emphasizing the policy's role in crime reduction. Critics, including the NRA, oppose the ruling, viewing it as targeting law-abiding individuals. The NRA advocates for tougher penalties for illegal gun possession, aligning with Bloomberg's enforcement approach. Despite other gun control measures, stop-and-frisk remains a key tool in reducing crime. The legal battle continues, with arguments that the ruling is racist and that law-abiding gun owners are unfairly targeted. The debate underscores tensions between public safety and civil liberties, with moral implications on both sides. **END OF SUMMARY.**
