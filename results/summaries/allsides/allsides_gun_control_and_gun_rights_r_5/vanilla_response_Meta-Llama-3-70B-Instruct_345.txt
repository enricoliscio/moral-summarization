SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to defend the city's "stop and frisk" program have been thwarted by the City Council, which overrode his veto of two bills that will create an inspector general to oversee police tactics and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims the move will put minorities at higher risk, as they have benefited most from crime reduction. The mayor had previously appealed a federal court ruling that deemed the program a violation of the Fourth Amendment and racial profiling. Bloomberg has also criticized the National Rifle Association (NRA), linking them to plaintiffs in federal lawsuits, despite the NRA never taking an official position on stop-and-frisk policies. The NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession, which aligns with New York's existing laws.
