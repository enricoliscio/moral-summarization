Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points. 

The article is about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's stance on gun control and the "stop and frisk" policy. It mentions that Bloomberg has spent a lot of money trying to implement gun bans nationwide, but these laws haven't stopped criminals from getting guns. So, he resorted to stop and frisk, which has been successful in reducing crime but is now being challenged legally.

The City Council overrode Bloomberg's veto to create an inspector general for the NYPD, which will oversee stop and frisk. Bloomberg argues that this move puts minorities at higher risk because they benefited most from the crime reduction. A judge ruled stop and frisk unconstitutional, considering it racial profiling. Bloomberg is appealing, claiming it's legal and effective, having taken thousands of illegal guns off the streets.

Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long supports stop and frisk, saying it's crucial for safety. Bloomberg criticizes the ACLU and the NRA, linking them to the legal challenges, which the article disputes. The NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop and frisk, and the article argues that their focus is on law-abiding gun owners, not criminals. The author suggests that Bloomberg's policies haven't reduced crime elsewhere and that the legal ruling against stop and frisk is misguided.

I need to capture the moral arguments: Bloomberg's support for stop and frisk for public safety vs. the criticism that it's racially profiling. Also, the article challenges the portrayal of the NRA as a bogeyman and argues against the legal ruling, suggesting it's a setback for safety.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points, making sure to highlight the moral framing as presented by the author. I'll keep it under 200 words, starting with Bloomberg's efforts, the legal challenges, his arguments, the opposition's views, and the critique of the NRA's role.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and captures all key points with the moral perspectives.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been a vocal advocate for gun control, spending millions to promote restrictive gun laws nationwide. Despite his efforts, criminals continue to access firearms, leading to the adoption of "stop and frisk" tactics to combat illegal gun possession. This policy has significantly reduced crime, including a 50% drop in the murder rate, according to Bloomberg. However, a federal judge recently ruled that the "stop and frisk" program violates the Fourth Amendment and constitutes racial profiling, targeting blacks and Hispanics. The City Council has overridden Bloomberg's veto to establish an inspector general to oversee such tactics, a move the mayor claims will endanger minority communities who have benefited most from crime reduction.

Bloomberg has also criticized the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), accusing them of prioritizing ideology over public safety. However, the article argues that the NRA has not officially opposed "stop and frisk" and that its focus is on protecting law-abiding gun owners, not criminals. The author suggests that Bloomberg's policies, such as bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have not proven effective in reducing crime. The legal challenge to "stop and frisk" is seen as a misguided attack on a proven method of reducing illegal gun possession and saving lives. END OF SUMMARY.
