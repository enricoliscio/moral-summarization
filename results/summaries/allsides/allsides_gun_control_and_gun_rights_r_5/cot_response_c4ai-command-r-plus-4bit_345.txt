SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempts to impose his gun control agenda on the rest of America have been met with resistance, and his controversial "Stop-Question-Frisk" program has been deemed racial profiling and a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Despite Bloomberg's claims that the program has reduced the murder rate and taken thousands of *illegal* guns off the streets, the City Council has overridden his veto, creating an NYPD inspector general to oversee the tactic and allowing more groups to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that the ruling will put minorities at higher *risk*, and he plans to appeal, blaming the NRA and the ACLU for putting ideology before safety. The NRA, however, has not taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for *illegal* gun possession. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have not reduced crime. The article concludes by calling for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against the "Stop-Question-Frisk" program, arguing that taking *illegal* guns from criminals is not *racist* or *evil*. It also criticizes Bloomberg for his apparent *disgust* towards law-abiding gun owners.
