SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has spent a significant amount of his own money advocating for stricter gun control laws across America, despite the ineffectiveness of such laws in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms. In response to the failure of his gun bans, Bloomberg has relied on aggressive policing tactics such as stop and frisk to confiscate illegal guns. However, this approach has recently been challenged, with a federal judge ruling that the practice violates the Fourth Amendment and amounts to racial profiling. The New York City Council has also voted to override Bloomberg's veto of two bills that will increase oversight of the police department and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that these decisions will put minorities at greater risk and hinder crime reduction efforts. The NRA, often blamed by Bloomberg for the prevalence of gun violence, has not taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk policies. Instead, they advocate for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have also failed to reduce crime. The article concludes by calling for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against stop and frisk and for Bloomberg to temper his disdain for law-abiding gun owners.
