SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's efforts to institute gun bans have been thwarted, despite his claims that they have reduced crime. Instead, he has resorted to policing tactics like stop and frisk to take illegal guns away from criminals. However, the City Council has overrode his veto, allowing for more oversight and lawsuits against racial profiling. Bloomberg blames this decision for putting minorities at higher risk, despite the fact that his stop and frisk program has been deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment and racial profiling. The mayor's actions are seen as a way to deflect blame and link the NRA to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits. Critics argue that Bloomberg's real agenda is against law-abiding gun owners, and that his methods have not actually reduced crime. The NRA, on the other hand, advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession and has never taken a stance on stop and frisk policies. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling, and Bloomberg should try harder to hide his disgust for law-abiding gun owners.

END OF SUMMARY.
