Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policies on gun control and stop-and-frisk. Let me read through the article again to make sure I get all the key points.

First, the article talks about Bloomberg spending a lot of his own money to push for gun bans across America, but these laws haven't stopped criminals from getting guns. So, he resorted to stop-and-frisk tactics. The City Council recently overrode his veto on two bills: one creating an inspector general for the NYPD to oversee stop-and-frisk, and another allowing more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that this will put minorities at higher risk because they've benefited the most from crime reduction. 

There's a mention of a court ruling that stop-and-frisk was a Fourth Amendment violation and considered racial profiling. Bloomberg plans to appeal, saying other courts have found it legal. He points out that stop-and-frisk has led to 8,000 illegal guns being confiscated and a halved murder rate during his terms. A conservative party chairman supports Bloomberg, saying stop-and-frisk has made NYC safer and saved lives, especially for minorities.

Bloomberg also criticizes the NRA and the ACLU, linking them to the lawsuits against stop-and-frisk. He argues that the right to walk safely without being shot should take precedence over other rights. Critics, like the chairman, say Bloomberg's anti-gun agenda is misplaced since NYC already has strict gun laws. The article also mentions that the NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk, and the columnist's claim that they're against it is unfounded.

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include all these points: Bloomberg's spending, stop-and-frisk, the City Council's override, his arguments, the court ruling, his appeal, the impact of stop-and-frisk, support from the conservative chairman, his criticism of NRA and ACLU, and the NRA's actual stance.

I should structure it to flow logically, starting with Bloomberg's actions, the council's move, his response, the court case, his support for stop-and-frisk, the criticism of the NRA and ACLU, and the NRA's neutral stance. Also, mention that other gun control measures haven't reduced crime, supporting the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk.

I need to make sure not to include too much detail but cover all main points succinctly. Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within 200 words.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions advocating for gun control and using stop-and-frisk tactics to combat crime. Recently, the City Council overrode his veto, creating an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk and allowing more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this endangers minorities, who have benefited most from crime reduction. A court ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, citing racial profiling, but Bloomberg plans to appeal, citing its success in reducing crime and confiscating illegal guns. A conservative leader supports Bloomberg, stating stop-and-frisk saves lives, especially for minorities. Bloomberg criticizes the NRA and ACLU, linking them to lawsuits, but the NRA has no official stance on stop-and-frisk. Critics argue Bloomberg's anti-gun agenda is misplaced, as NYC already has strict laws. END OF SUMMARY.
