Okay, so I need to summarize this news article, but also identify the morally framed words. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article talks about NYC Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to implement gun bans and his use of stop-and-frisk tactics. It mentions that Bloomberg has spent a lot of money trying to enforce these laws, but they haven't stopped criminals. Instead, he resorted to stop-and-frisk, which is now being challenged.

First, I need to identify the morally framed words. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation. Let me go through the article again.

- "Gun bans" - neutral, but in context, it's framed as Bloomberg's agenda.
- "Tens of millions" - not moral, just factual.
- "Billion" - same.
- "Criminals" - negative.
- "Stop and frisk" - morally charged because it's about policing tactics.
- "Overrode" - neutral, but in context, it's about a political decision.
- "Inspector general" - neutral, but oversight is a moral consideration.
- "Racial profiling" - negative.
- "Higher risk" - negative.
- "Crime reduction" - positive.
- "Fourth Amendment" - legal, but the violation is negative.
- "Racial profiling" again.
- "Appeal" - neutral.
- "Precedents" - neutral.
- "Illegal guns" - negative.
- "Murder rate" - negative.
- "Safer" - positive.
- "People of color" - neutral, but in context, it's about benefiting them.
- "Important tool" - positive.
- "Chicago" - negative, as a comparison to a dangerous city.
- "Blaming" - negative.
- "National Rifle Association (NRA)" - neutral, but framed negatively by Bloomberg.
- "Lawsuits" - neutral.
- "New York Civil Liberties Union" - neutral, but framed negatively by Bloomberg.
- "Priority" - neutral, but used to show their focus.
- "Protecting our safety" - positive.
- "Privacy" - neutral, but in context, it's a right.
- "Blown away" - negative.
- "Wrong" - negative.
- "Agenda" - neutral, but used negatively.
- "Toughest restrictions" - positive.
- "Out of order" - negative.
- "Bogeyman" - negative.
- "Opponents" - neutral, but in a negative context.
- "Gun control" - neutral, but framed negatively.
- "False impression" - negative.
- "Gray area" - neutral, but implies uncertainty.
- "Law-abiding people" - positive.
- "Illegal firearms" - negative.
- "Safer" - positive.
- "Tougher sentencing" - positive.
- "Conceded" - neutral, but shows agreement.
- "Illegal guns" - negative.
- "Criminals" - negative.
- "Magazine" - neutral, but part of the gun control debate.
- "Pistol grip" - neutral, but part of the argument.
- "Background checks" - neutral, but framed as ineffective.
- "Crimes" - negative.
- "Stop and frisk" - negative in the ruling.
- "Racist" - negative.
- "Disgust" - negative.

Now, for the summary. I need to include as many of these morally framed words as possible while keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure it to cover Bloomberg's efforts, the stop-and-frisk ruling, the political response, and the NRA's role.

I should start with Bloomberg's spending and gun bans, mention stop-and-frisk, the ruling against it, the City Council's action, Bloomberg's arguments, the impact on crime, the NRA's stance, and the debate over rights vs. safety.

Let me draft that.

**Summary:**

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has invested heavily in promoting gun bans and utilizing stop-and-frisk tactics, which have faced criticism for racial profiling. The City Council recently overrode his veto to create an inspector general to oversee such tactics, following a federal ruling that stop-and-frisk violated the Fourth Amendment. Bloomberg argues that this decision puts minorities at higher risk, as they benefited most from crime reduction. However, critics, including Mike Long of the Conservative Party, support stop-and-frisk as a tool for safety, comparing its absence to the higher crime rates in Chicago.

Bloomberg has also criticized the NRA, framing it as a bogeyman, despite the NRA's neutral stance on stop-and-frisk. The NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession, aligning with Bloomberg's past acknowledgment of its effectiveness. However, Bloomberg's other gun control measures, like bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have not reduced crime. The debate centers on balancing the rights of law-abiding gun owners with public safety, with critics arguing that Bloomberg's approach unfairly targets minorities. The federal appeals court is expected to review the stop-and-frisk ruling, highlighting the ongoing tension between safety and civil liberties.
