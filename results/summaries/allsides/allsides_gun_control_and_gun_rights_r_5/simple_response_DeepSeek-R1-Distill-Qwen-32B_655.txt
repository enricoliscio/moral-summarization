Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article is about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts regarding gun control and the stop-and-frisk policy. It mentions that Bloomberg has spent a lot of money trying to implement gun bans across America, but these laws haven't stopped criminals from getting guns. That's why he resorted to stop-and-frisk, which has been successful in reducing crime but is now being challenged.

The City Council overrode Bloomberg's veto, creating an inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk and allowing more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this will put minorities at higher risk because they've benefited from crime reduction. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk violated the Fourth Amendment and was racial profiling against blacks and Hispanics. Bloomberg is appealing, saying other courts found it legal and that it's saved lives by seizing illegal guns and reducing murder rates.

Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long supports stop-and-frisk, crediting it for making NYC safe, especially for minorities. Bloomberg blames the NRA for opposing gun control, comparing them to the plaintiffs. The article criticizes this by pointing out the NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk and that other gun control measures haven't reduced crime. The author seems to support Bloomberg's policies but also questions the effectiveness of other measures and the link to the NRA.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing. The key points are: Bloomberg's spending on gun control, the stop-and-frisk policy's success and controversy, the City Council's override, the legal challenges, Bloomberg's arguments, support from Mike Long, Bloomberg's criticism of the NRA, and the author's critique of linking the NRA to the issue.

I should ensure the summary reflects the moral arguments presented, like the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk in saving lives versus the racial profiling concerns, and the criticism of Bloomberg's NRA accusations without evidence.

Let me structure this step by step, making sure each point is concise and the moral aspects are clear.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has invested heavily in promoting gun control nationwide, despite its ineffectiveness in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms. He relied on the stop-and-frisk policy, which reduced crime but faced legal challenges for racial profiling. The City Council recently overrode Bloomberg's veto, establishing an inspector general to oversee the policy and allowing lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this decision endangers minorities, who have benefited most from crime reduction. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, targeting blacks and Hispanics, but Bloomberg appeals, citing its success in seizing illegal guns and reducing murders. Conservative leader Mike Long supports the policy, crediting it for NYC's safety. Bloomberg criticizes the NRA for opposing gun control, equating them with plaintiffs. However, the NRA hasn't officially opposed stop-and-frisk, and other gun control measures haven't reduced crime. The author questions Bloomberg's NRA accusations and the policy's future. END OF SUMMARY.
