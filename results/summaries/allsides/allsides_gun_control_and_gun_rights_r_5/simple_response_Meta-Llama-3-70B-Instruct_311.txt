SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to ban guns and implement stop-and-frisk policies have been met with resistance. Despite his claims that these measures have reduced crime, critics argue that they unfairly target minorities and infringe upon citizens' rights. The City Council has overridden Bloomberg's veto, allowing for the creation of an inspector general to oversee police tactics and permitting more lawsuits against the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg blames the National Rifle Association (NRA) for the opposition, but the NRA has never taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk policies. In reality, the NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession, which Bloomberg himself has acknowledged as effective. The article suggests that Bloomberg's true agenda is to restrict law-abiding gun owners, rather than addressing the root causes of crime.
