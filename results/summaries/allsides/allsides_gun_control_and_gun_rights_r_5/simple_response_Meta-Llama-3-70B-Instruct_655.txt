SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to ban guns have been unsuccessful, and he has resorted to policing tactics like stop and frisk to remove firearms from criminals. However, the City Council has overridden his veto of two bills that will create a police inspector general and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, but critics argue that stop and frisk has been effective in reducing crime and saving lives. Bloomberg has also tried to link the National Rifle Association (NRA) to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits, but the NRA has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies. The NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession, which Bloomberg has conceded is effective. The article argues that Bloomberg's gun control agenda is misguided and that stop and frisk is a necessary tool for keeping cities safe.
