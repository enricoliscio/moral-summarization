SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to ban guns have been unsuccessful in stopping criminals from obtaining firearms, leading him to resort to policing tactics like stop and frisk. However, the City Council has overrode his veto, allowing for an inspector general to oversee these tactics and enabling more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, as they have benefited most from crime reduction. He points out that stop and frisk has taken 8,000 illegal guns off the streets and cut the murder rate in half. Bloomberg has also blamed the National Rifle Association (NRA) for opposing his gun control measures, but the NRA has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies. In reality, the NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for possession of illegal guns, which has been effective in making cities safer. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling that stop and frisk is racist, and Bloomberg should stop blaming law-abiding gun owners for his own failures.

END OF SUMMARY.
