SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a fortune of his own money trying to institute his gun bans across America, but his efforts have not stopped criminals from obtaining guns. As a result, Bloomberg has relied on policing tactics such as stop and frisk to get guns off the streets. However, this tactic has recently been banned, and Bloomberg is searching for someone to blame. The City Council overrode Bloomberg's veto of two bills that will create an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop and frisk and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argued that this decision will put minorities at higher risk and increase crime rates. The mayor pointed to the success of stop and frisk in reducing the murder rate and confiscating illegal guns. However, critics argue that Bloomberg is out of touch with the reality of gun control and is unfairly blaming the NRA for the world's evils. The NRA has never taken a stance on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have not proven effective in reducing crime. The article concludes by calling for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against stop and frisk and for Bloomberg to hide his disdain for law-abiding gun owners.
END OF SUMMARY.
