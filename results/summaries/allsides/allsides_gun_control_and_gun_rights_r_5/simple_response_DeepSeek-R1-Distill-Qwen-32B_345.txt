Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author provided. The article is about New York City Mayor Bloomberg's gun control policies, specifically the stop-and-frisk program. The author seems critical of Bloomberg, arguing that his tactics have been effective but are now being overturned, and he's blaming others like the NRA. 

First, I should identify the main points: Bloomberg spent money to push gun bans, used stop-and-frisk which was effective but led to racial profiling accusations. The City Council overrode his veto, creating an inspector general and allowing lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this puts minorities at risk because they benefited from crime reduction. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, and Bloomberg is appealing. He also criticizes the NRA, claiming they're against his policies. The author argues that stop-and-frisk saved lives, especially for minorities, and that the NRA hasn't opposed it. The article ends by suggesting that Bloomberg's other gun control measures haven't reduced crime, and the court should overturn the ruling.

I need to make sure the summary reflects the author's perspective, which seems to support stop-and-frisk and criticize the ruling and Bloomberg's blame on the NRA. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and use the SUMMARY and END tokens as instructed.

So, I'll structure it by mentioning Bloomberg's efforts, the stop-and-frisk program, the council's action, his response, the legal issues, the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, the NRA's stance, and the author's conclusion about crime reduction and the court's decision.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has faced criticism for his aggressive gun control policies, including the stop-and-frisk program, which he claims has reduced crime and saved lives, particularly in minority communities. However, a federal judge ruled the program unconstitutional due to racial profiling, leading Bloomberg to appeal and blame the National Rifle Association (NRA) for opposing his efforts. The City Council recently overrode Bloomberg's veto to create an inspector general for the NYPD and allow lawsuits against racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this move endangers minorities, while supporters like Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long defend stop-and-frisk as a crucial tool for safety. The author criticizes Bloomberg for scapegoating the NRA, noting the NRA has not officially opposed stop-and-frisk and advocates for tougher penalties for illegal gun possession. The article concludes that Bloomberg's other gun control measures have not reduced crime, and the court should overturn the ruling against stop-and-frisk, emphasizing its effectiveness in saving lives. END OF SUMMARY.
