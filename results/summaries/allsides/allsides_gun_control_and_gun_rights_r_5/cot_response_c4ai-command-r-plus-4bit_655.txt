SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a fortune of his own money attempting to institute his gun ban laws across America, despite their ineffectiveness in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms. Bloomberg's focus has shifted to policing tactics such as stop and frisk, which has recently been banned by the City Council. The mayor claims that this decision puts minorities at *risk*, as they have benefited most from the reduction in crime that resulted from such tactics. The vote to override Bloomberg's veto was influenced by a federal court ruling that deemed the "Stop-Question-Frisk" program a *violation* of the Fourth Amendment and an instance of racial profiling. Bloomberg defended the tactic, citing the confiscation of *illegal* guns and the decrease in murder rates. He also attempted to shift blame onto the NRA, accusing them of prioritizing ideology over safety. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's own agenda against guns and the NRA is the driving force behind his statements. The NRA has never taken a stance on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for possession of *illegal* guns. Bloomberg's national agenda, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, has failed to reduce crime. The article calls for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against stop and frisk, exposing Bloomberg's disdain for law-abiding gun owners.
