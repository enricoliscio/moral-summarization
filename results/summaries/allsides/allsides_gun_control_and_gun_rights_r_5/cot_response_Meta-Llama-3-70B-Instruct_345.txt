SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's efforts to ban guns have been unsuccessful in stopping criminals from getting guns, leading him to resort to policing tactics like stop and frisk. Despite its success in reducing crime, the City Council has overridden the mayor's veto, allowing for more oversight and lawsuits against the police for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, but critics argue that stop and frisk has saved lives, particularly for people of color. Bloomberg has also tried to link the National Rifle Association (NRA) to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits, accusing them of having an "ideology" that prioritizes guns over safety. However, the NRA has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. The mayor's "agenda" against guns and the NRA is seen as misguided and "absurd" by some. END OF SUMMARY.
