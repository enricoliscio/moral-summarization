Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his stance on gun control and stop-and-frisk policies. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

First, the article mentions that Bloomberg has spent a lot of money trying to implement gun bans across the US, but these laws haven't stopped criminals from getting guns. That's why he resorted to stop-and-frisk tactics. However, the City Council recently overrode his veto on two bills that create an inspector general for the NYPD to oversee such tactics and allow more people to sue for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that this will put minorities at higher risk because they've benefited most from the crime reduction.

Then, there's a mention of a court ruling that found the stop-and-frisk program unconstitutional, which Bloomberg is appealing. He claims it's been effective in reducing crime and seizing illegal guns. Supporters like Mike Long from the Conservative Party agree, saying it's made the city safer, especially for minorities, and without it, crime could rise like in Chicago.

Bloomberg also criticizes the NRA and the ACLU, linking them to opposing his policies. However, the article points out that the NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk and that Bloomberg's other gun control measures haven't reduced crime. The author suggests that the court should overturn the ruling and that Bloomberg should reconsider his approach.

So, the key points are: Bloomberg's spending on gun control, the stop-and-frisk controversy, the City Council's action, the court ruling, his appeal, the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, the political backlash, and the NRA's stance. I need to condense all this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and arguments without getting too detailed.

I should structure the summary to first introduce Bloomberg and his policies, then the recent developments with the City Council and court ruling, followed by the arguments for and against stop-and-frisk, and conclude with the broader implications and criticisms.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions promoting gun bans and stop-and-frisk tactics, despite criticism that such laws haven't halted criminal access to firearms. Recently, the City Council overrode Bloomberg's veto of bills creating an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk and allowing more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this move endangers minorities, who have benefited from crime reduction under his policies. A federal judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, citing racial profiling, but Bloomberg, who has cut the city's murder rate in half, plans to appeal, claiming the tactic is legal and effective. Supporters like Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long credit stop-and-frisk with saving lives, especially in minority communities, warning crime could surge without it. Bloomberg has also criticized the NRA and ACLU, linking them to opposing his policies. However, the NRA hasn't officially weighed in on stop-and-frisk, and Bloomberg's other gun control measures haven't reduced crime. Critics argue the court should overturn the ruling, and Bloomberg should focus on law-abiding gun owners. END OF SUMMARY.
