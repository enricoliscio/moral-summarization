Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. My task is to create a concise summary, up to 200 words, using as many of those words as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about NYC Mayor Bloomberg's push for gun control and his use of stop-and-frisk tactics. The City Council overrode his veto, creating an inspector general and allowing lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that this will put minorities at higher risk, while critics say stop-and-frisk is racist. The NRA is mentioned as a bogeyman, and the author seems critical of Bloomberg's tactics and the media's portrayal.

Now, I need to identify the key moral words from the list that fit into the summary. Words like "instituted," "stopped," "blame," "overrode," "veto," "allow," "put," "reduction," "taken," "cut," "safer," "saved," "making," "like," "blaming," "link," "protecting," "trump," "wrong," "against," "fight," "die," "gives," "defending," "law-abiding," "association," "impression," "go," "grabbing," "crime," "checking," "method," "sentencing," "possession," "enforcing," "prosecuting," "having," "reduced," "overturn," "ruling," "taking," "harder," "disgust."

I'll structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll mention Bloomberg's efforts to institute gun bans, his use of stop-and-frisk, the City Council overriding his veto, the creation of the inspector general, and the lawsuit possibilities. Bloomberg blames the move for putting minorities at risk, while critics argue it's racial profiling. The NRA is portrayed negatively, and the author questions the media's portrayal.

I need to ensure the summary is under 200 words, so I'll be concise. I'll make sure to include the moral framing words without making the summary feel forced. I'll also maintain the author's perspective, which seems critical of Bloomberg and the media's portrayal of the NRA.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to incorporate as many of the listed words as possible without making it awkward. I'll check the word count and adjust as needed.

SUMMARY:  
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions trying to institute gun bans nationwide, despite their failure to stop criminals from obtaining firearms. He relied on stop-and-frisk tactics to take guns away from bad guys, but this method is now being scrutinized. The City Council overrode his veto, creating an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk and allowing more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg blames this move for putting minorities at higher risk, arguing they benefited most from crime reduction. Critics, including Mike Long, argue stop-and-frisk has made NYC safer, saving lives and cutting the murder rate. Bloomberg also blamed the NRA for opposing gun control, claiming it protects ideology over safety. However, the NRA has never officially opposed stop-and-frisk and focuses on enforcing laws against illegal gun possession. The author questions the media's portrayal of the NRA as a bogeyman and criticizes Bloomberg's disgust for law-abiding gun owners. The federal court's ruling against stop-and-frisk is seen as absurd, and Bloomberg is urged to focus on what truly reduces crime. END OF SUMMARY.
