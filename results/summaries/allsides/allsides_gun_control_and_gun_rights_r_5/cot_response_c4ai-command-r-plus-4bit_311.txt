SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a fortune trying to institute his gun control agenda across the nation, despite a lack of evidence that such laws reduce crime. In New York City, Bloomberg has relied on the "Stop-Question-Frisk" program to get guns off the streets and reduce the murder rate. However, this program has recently been deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment and racially biased by a federal judge. Bloomberg has vowed to appeal the decision, arguing that the program has saved lives, especially in minority communities. The mayor has faced criticism from both gun rights advocates and civil liberties groups, with Bloomberg blaming the National Rifle Association for the world's evils and associating them with the plaintiffs in the lawsuits against the "Stop-Question-Frisk" program. The NRA, however, has never taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk policies. Despite Bloomberg's efforts, the City Council has overridden his veto of bills that will create an NYPD inspector general to oversee the tactic and allow more groups to sue the city for racial profiling. The article argues that Bloomberg's disgust for law-abiding gun owners and his attempts to ban certain types of firearms are misguided, as they do not address the root causes of crime. Instead, the article suggests that focusing on enforcing existing laws and sentencing illegal gun possession more harshly would be a more effective approach to making cities safer.
