SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun control efforts have been thwarted by the City Council's override of his veto on two bills, which will create a police inspector general and allow more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, despite stop-and-frisk resulting in 8,000 illegal guns being taken off the streets and a 50% reduction in the murder rate. Critics argue that Bloomberg's real agenda is to restrict gun ownership, citing his attacks on the National Rifle Association (NRA). However, the NRA has never taken a stance on stop-and-frisk and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. The author argues that Bloomberg's gun control measures have not reduced crime and that the federal appeals court should overturn the ruling that stop-and-frisk is racist.
