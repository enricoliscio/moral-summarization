SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has spent a significant amount of his fortune attempting to implement his gun control agenda across America, despite the ineffectiveness of such laws in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms. As a result, Bloomberg has relied on aggressive policing tactics such as stop and frisk to curb gun violence. However, a recent federal court ruling deemed the practice unconstitutional due to racial profiling concerns, and the New York City Council has overridden Bloomberg's veto of bills aimed at increasing oversight and reducing the use of stop and frisk. Bloomberg argues that the decision will put minorities at greater risk and points to the success of the tactic in reducing the city's murder rate. While critics accuse Bloomberg of unfairly targeting the NRA and law-abiding gun owners, supporters argue that stop and frisk has played a crucial role in making New York one of the safest cities in the country. The NRA itself has not taken an official stance on stop and frisk, focusing instead on advocating for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have also failed to reduce crime. The article concludes by calling for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against stop and frisk.
