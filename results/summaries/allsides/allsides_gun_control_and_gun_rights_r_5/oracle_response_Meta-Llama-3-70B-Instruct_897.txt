SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to institute gun bans have been thwarted, and he's now looking to blame someone for the City Council's override of his veto on two bills. These bills will create a police inspector general to oversee tactics like stop and frisk, allowing more people to sue for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, despite stop and frisk having taken 8,000 illegal guns off the streets and cutting the murder rate in half. He's accused of blaming the National Rifle Association (NRA) for all the world's evils, trying to link them to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits. However, the NRA has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's own agenda against guns and the NRA is misguided, and his disgust for law-abiding gun owners is evident. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling that taking illegal guns off the streets is racist.

END OF SUMMARY.
