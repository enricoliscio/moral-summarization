Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his stance on gun control and stop-and-frisk policies. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning that Bloomberg has spent a lot of money trying to implement gun bans across America, but these laws haven't stopped criminals from getting guns. That's why he resorted to stop-and-frisk tactics. Now, the City Council has overridden his veto on two bills that create an inspector general for the NYPD and allow more people to sue for racial profiling. Bloomberg thinks this will put minorities at higher risk because they've benefited from crime reduction. 

There was a recent court ruling that stop-and-frisk violated the Fourth Amendment and was racial profiling. Bloomberg is appealing this decision, arguing that it's legal and that the tactic has led to 8,000 illegal guns being confiscated and a halved murder rate. Supporters like Mike Long from the Conservative Party credit stop-and-frisk with making NYC safe, especially for minorities. 

Bloomberg also criticizes the NRA and the ACLU, linking them to the lawsuits against stop-and-frisk. He believes in stricter gun laws but hasn't seen a reduction in crime from other measures like bans on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines. The NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk but supports tougher penalties for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg acknowledges this but continues to push his agenda.

The article ends by questioning the effectiveness of Bloomberg's tactics and suggesting that the court should overturn the ruling, implying it's based on flawed reasoning.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Bloomberg's spending on gun control, the stop-and-frisk policy, the City Council's override, the court ruling, Bloomberg's arguments and criticisms, and the NRA's stance. I should ensure the summary flows logically and covers all main aspects without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions promoting gun control nationwide, despite its ineffectiveness against criminals. He relied on stop-and-frisk tactics, which reduced crime but faced criticism for racial profiling. Recently, the City Council overrode his veto, creating an NYPD inspector general and allowing lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this risks minority safety, as they benefited most from crime reduction. A court ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, targeting minorities, but Bloomberg appeals, citing its success in seizing 8,000 illegal guns and halving murder rates. Supporters like Mike Long credit the policy for NYC's safety. Bloomberg criticizes the NRA and ACLU, linking them to lawsuits, while advocating stricter gun laws. However, other measures like assault weapon bans haven't reduced crime. The NRA supports tougher penalties for illegal guns but hasn't taken a stance on stop-and-frisk. Bloomberg's critics argue his tactics are ineffective and target law-abiding gun owners. END OF SUMMARY.
