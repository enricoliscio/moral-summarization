Alright, so the user has given me a query where I need to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task is to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. They've broken it down into two steps: first, identifying morally framed words, and then writing a summary that includes as many of those words as possible.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a positive or negative connotation, indicating approval or disapproval. For example, "bans," "criminals," "policing tactics," "success," "blame," etc. I should go through the article and pick out each word that has such a connotation.

Looking at the article, it's about Mayor Bloomberg's gun control efforts, stop and frisk policies, and the reactions from various groups. I'll go through each sentence and note words that carry moral weight. Words like "bans," "criminals," "policing tactics," "success," "blame," "overrode," "Inspector General," "tactics," "sue," "racial profiling," "benefited," "safer," "saved," "lives," "color," "important tool," "safest," "Chicago," "accustomed," "blame," "National Rifle Association," "world’s evils," "link," "organization," "plaintiffs," "lawsuits," "priority," "protecting," "ideology," "trump," "citizens," "blown away," "wrong," "agenda," "restrictions," "out of order," "bogeyman," "opponents," "unrelated," "defending," "rights," "innocent deaths," "false impression," "never," "position," "advocacy," "grabbing," "proven method," "safer," "advocates," "tougher sentencing," "conceded," "rightly," "prosecuting," "reduced crime," "magazine," "pistol grip," "weapons," "absurd ruling," "racist," "disgust," "law-abiding."

Next, I need to write a concise summary, under 200 words, that includes as many of these words as possible. The summary should reflect the moral framing present in the original text. I'll focus on the key points: Bloomberg's gun control efforts, the stop and frisk policy, the legal challenges, the reactions from different groups, and the moral arguments presented by both sides.

I'll start by introducing Bloomberg's efforts and the criticism he's facing. Then, mention the City Council's override of his veto, the legal ruling against stop and frisk, and his appeal. Highlight the arguments from supporters like Mike Long and the opposition from groups like the ACLU and the NRA. Conclude with the ongoing debate and the moral implications each side presents.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and includes the morally charged words without making it too dense. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Also, I should make sure the summary accurately reflects the original article's content and the moral perspectives presented.

Finally, I'll structure the summary to start with the main issue, then the actions taken, the reactions, and the ongoing debate. This way, the summary is comprehensive yet concise, preserving the moral framing as required.

**SUMMARY:**

New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has spent millions advocating for gun bans, despite their ineffectiveness in stopping criminals. His stop-and-frisk policy, though successful in reducing crime, was recently ruled unconstitutional due to racial profiling. The City Council overrode Bloomberg's veto, creating an Inspector General to oversee policing tactics and allowing lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this decision puts minorities at higher risk, while critics argue the policy unfairly targets blacks and Hispanics. Bloomberg accused the National Rifle Association (NRA) of opposing safety measures, but the NRA has never taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk. Supporters, like Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long, credit stop-and-frisk with making New York safer and preventing deaths. Bloomberg also criticized the ACLU for prioritizing ideology over safety, linking it to the NRA. The NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession, a stance Bloomberg acknowledges. However, Bloomberg’s other gun control measures, like bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have not reduced crime. Critics argue that Bloomberg’s focus on blaming the NRA distracts from the real issue: ensuring public safety without infringing on rights. The debate highlights conflicting priorities between protecting citizens and upholding constitutional rights.
