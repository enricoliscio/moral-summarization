SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a significant amount of his fortune attempting to implement his gun control agenda across America, despite the ineffectiveness of such laws in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms. As a result, Bloomberg has relied on aggressive policing tactics like stop and frisk to curb gun violence. However, a recent federal court ruling deemed the practice unconstitutional due to racial profiling concerns, and the New York City Council has voted to override Bloomberg's veto of two bills aimed at curbing the practice. Bloomberg argues that the tactic has been successful in reducing crime and saving lives, particularly in minority communities. He also criticizes the NRA for opposing gun control measures, claiming that their ideology puts lives at risk. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's agenda is out of touch with reality and that the NRA's stance on gun rights does not contribute to innocent deaths. The NRA has never taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have also failed to reduce crime. The article concludes by calling for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against stop and frisk and for Bloomberg to acknowledge the rights of law-abiding gun owners.
