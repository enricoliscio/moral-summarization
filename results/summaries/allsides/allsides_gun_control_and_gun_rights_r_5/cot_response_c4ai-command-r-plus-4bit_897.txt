SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempt to institute his gun control agenda nationwide has been met with resistance, and his controversial "Stop-Question-Frisk" program has been deemed racial profiling and a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Bloomberg argues that this program has made New York City safer by removing illegal guns from criminals, reducing the murder rate, and protecting minorities from higher risk. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's tactics are immoral and ineffective, and that his disdain for law-abiding gun owners and the NRA is unjustified. They argue that Bloomberg's agenda items, such as banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have not reduced crime. The article concludes by calling for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against the "Stop-Question-Frisk" program and for Bloomberg to acknowledge the rights of law-abiding gun owners.
