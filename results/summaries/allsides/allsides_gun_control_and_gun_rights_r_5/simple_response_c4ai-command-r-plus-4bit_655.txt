SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been a strong advocate for gun control and has spent significant financial resources to institute his gun bans across the country. However, these laws have been ineffective in preventing criminals from accessing firearms. As a result, Bloomberg has relied on policing tactics such as stop and frisk to get guns off the streets. Unfortunately, a recent decision by the City Council to override Bloomberg's veto of two bills will limit the use of stop and frisk and make it easier to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that this decision will put minorities at greater risk and increase the crime rate. The NRA, which has been criticized by Bloomberg and others for its stance on gun rights, has never officially taken a position on stop-and-frisk policies. Instead, it focuses on advocating for tougher sentencing for possession of illegal guns. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have also failed to reduce crime. The author argues that the federal appeals court should overturn the ruling that taking illegal guns from criminals is racist and that Bloomberg should respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners.
