Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the author's perspective.

The article talks about NYC Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to enforce gun control, specifically his use of stop-and-frisk tactics. The author seems critical of Bloomberg, especially his linking of the NRA to lawsuits against stop-and-frisk. There's a moral angle here about the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk versus the rights of individuals.

I should identify the key points: Bloomberg's spending on gun bans, the failure of these laws to prevent criminals from getting guns, the use of stop-and-frisk, the recent City Council decision to create an inspector general, Bloomberg's appeal against the court ruling, and his criticism of the NRA and ACLU.

The author seems to support stop-and-frisk as a necessary tool for safety, opposing the idea that it's racist. They also argue against Bloomberg's attacks on the NRA, suggesting that the NRA isn't against stop-and-frisk and that Bloomberg's policies haven't reduced crime elsewhere.

I need to make sure the summary reflects this moral framing: the importance of public safety vs. individual rights, the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, and the criticism of Bloomberg's tactics and his linking of the NRA to the issue.

I should structure the summary to include Bloomberg's actions, the council's response, the court ruling, the arguments for and against stop-and-frisk, and the critique of Bloomberg's NRA accusations. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the author's perspective on the moral issues involved.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has faced criticism for his aggressive gun control policies and reliance on stop-and-frisk tactics, which have been accused of racial profiling. Despite his claims that stop-and-frisk has reduced crime, a federal judge ruled the program unconstitutional, leading to its recent reform by the City Council. Bloomberg has blamed the National Rifle Association (NRA) for opposing his efforts, but the NRA has not officially taken a stance on stop-and-frisk. The author argues that Bloomberg's focus on symbolic gun control measures, such as banning high-capacity magazines, has not reduced crime, while stop-and-frisk has proven effective in removing illegal guns from the streets. The article criticizes Bloomberg for prioritizing ideology over public safety and for unfairly targeting the NRA as a scapegoat. END OF SUMMARY.
