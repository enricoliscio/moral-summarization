SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a significant amount of his own money to promote gun control measures across the country, despite their ineffectiveness in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms. In response to the failure of these measures, Bloomberg has relied on controversial policing tactics such as stop and frisk, which was recently ruled as unconstitutional and a form of racial profiling. The City Council has overridden Bloomberg's veto of two bills that will increase oversight of the police department and allow more people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that these measures will put minorities at greater risk and increase crime rates. However, critics argue that stop and frisk has been an effective tool in reducing crime and saving lives, particularly in communities of color. Bloomberg has also attempted to blame the National Rifle Association for the failure of his gun control efforts, despite the NRA's lack of involvement in stop-and-frisk policies. While Bloomberg claims that stop and frisk has removed thousands of illegal guns from the streets, critics argue that his other gun control measures, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have failed to reduce crime. The article concludes by calling for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against stop and frisk and for Bloomberg to acknowledge the rights of law-abiding gun owners.
