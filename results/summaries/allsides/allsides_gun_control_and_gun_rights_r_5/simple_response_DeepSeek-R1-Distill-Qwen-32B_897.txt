Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to enforce gun control and his use of stop-and-frisk tactics. He's spent a lot of money trying to implement gun bans across the U.S., but these laws haven't stopped criminals from getting guns. So, he resorted to stop-and-frisk, which led to a lot of guns being confiscated and a drop in the murder rate. However, the City Council recently overrode his veto on two bills that create an inspector general to oversee these tactics and allow more lawsuits for racial profiling.

The author seems critical of the City Council's decision, arguing that it puts minorities at higher risk because they benefited most from the crime reduction. They also mention a judge ruling that stop-and-frisk violated the Fourth Amendment and was racial profiling. Bloomberg is appealing this decision, saying other courts have found it legal.

There's also a part about Bloomberg blaming the NRA for the lawsuits, but the author points out that the NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk. The author supports Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk policy, seeing it as effective and necessary, while criticizing the judge's ruling as absurd and suggesting it's based on a false impression.

I need to capture the main points: Bloomberg's gun control efforts, the stop-and-frisk policy, the City Council's override, the legal challenges, and the moral arguments on both sides, especially the author's support for Bloomberg and criticism of the ruling and the NRA's role.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the key moral points: the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk, the issue of racial profiling, Bloomberg's criticism of the NRA, and the author's stance supporting Bloomberg's approach.

Let me structure this: start with Bloomberg's efforts, mention the stop-and-frisk success, the City Council's action, the legal ruling, Bloomberg's response, the author's support, and the criticism of the NRA's involvement.

I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all these aspects without getting too detailed. Also, preserve the author's framing, which seems to support Bloomberg and oppose the City Council's decision and the judge's ruling.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions promoting gun control and using stop-and-frisk tactics to reduce crime, resulting in 8,000 illegal guns confiscated and a halved murder rate. Recently, the City Council overrode his veto, creating an inspector general to oversee these tactics and allowing more lawsuits for racial profiling. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk violated the Fourth Amendment, targeting minorities, but Bloomberg, supported by conservatives, argues it's legal and essential for safety. The author criticizes the ruling as absurd, favoring Bloomberg's approach and criticizing the NRA's unproven link to the lawsuits. They argue that stop-and-frisk is effective and necessary, while the ruling risks public safety. END OF SUMMARY.
