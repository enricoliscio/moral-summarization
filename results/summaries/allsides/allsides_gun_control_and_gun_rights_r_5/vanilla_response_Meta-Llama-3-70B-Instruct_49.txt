SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's veto of two bills was overridden by the City Council, allowing for the creation of a NYPD inspector general to oversee tactics like stop and frisk, and expanding the categories of people who can sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claimed this would put minorities at higher risk, as they have benefited most from crime reduction. This comes after a federal judge ruled that the city's "Stop-Question-Frisk" program was a violation of the Fourth Amendment and constituted racial profiling. Bloomberg plans to appeal, citing the program's success in removing 8,000 illegal guns from the streets and halving the murder rate. Critics argue that Bloomberg is trying to blame the National Rifle Association (NRA) for the city's problems, despite the NRA never taking an official position on stop-and-frisk policies.

END OF SUMMARY.
