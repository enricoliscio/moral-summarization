SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions trying to institute his gun bans in the US, despite their ineffectiveness in stopping criminals from obtaining guns. Bloomberg's success in reducing crime in New York relies on policing tactics like stop and frisk, which was recently ruled as a violation of the Fourth Amendment and considered racial profiling. The City Council overrode Bloomberg's veto, creating an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop and frisk and allowing more groups to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues that stop and frisk has taken thousands of illegal guns off the streets and reduced the murder rate, especially benefiting minorities. However, critics argue that stop and frisk targets law-abiding citizens and that the NRA's defense of gun rights does not lead to more innocent deaths. The NRA has not taken an official position on stop and frisk but advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg's national agenda, including assault weapon bans and background checks, has not reduced crime. The article calls for the federal appeals court to overturn the ruling against stop and frisk and for Bloomberg to hide his disgust for law-abiding gun owners.
