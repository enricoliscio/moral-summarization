SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a significant amount of his own money to promote gun control measures across the United States, despite the ineffectiveness of such laws in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms. As a result, Bloomberg has relied on policing tactics like stop and frisk to get guns off the streets. However, a recent decision by the City Council to override Bloomberg's veto of two bills has limited the use of this tactic, with the mayor claiming that it will put minorities at greater risk. Bloomberg has vowed to appeal the decision, citing the success of stop and frisk in reducing the murder rate and confiscating illegal guns. The article also discusses Bloomberg's criticism of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and his efforts to link them to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits. The NRA, however, has not taken an official position on stop-and-frisk policies. The author argues that while stop and frisk can be an effective tool in making cities safer, Bloomberg's other gun control proposals have not been proven to reduce crime.
END OF SUMMARY.
