SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun control efforts have been dealt a blow as the City Council overrode his veto of two bills that will create a NYPD inspector general to oversee tactics like stop and frisk, and allow more categories of people to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, as they have benefited most from crime reduction. However, critics argue that stop and frisk has been an effective tool in reducing crime, taking 8,000 illegal guns off the streets and cutting the murder rate in half. Bloomberg's efforts to link the NRA to the plaintiffs in federal lawsuits have been met with skepticism, with some calling it a "false impression" and a "bogeyman" tactic. The NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession, which Bloomberg has conceded is a effective measure. The mayor's gun control agenda has been criticized for being ineffective in reducing crime. END OF SUMMARY.
