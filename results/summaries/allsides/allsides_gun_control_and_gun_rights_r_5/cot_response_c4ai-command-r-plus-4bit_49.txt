SUMMARY:
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a fortune of his billions trying to ban guns in America, yet these laws have not stopped criminals from obtaining them. Bloomberg has relied on policing tactics such as stop and frisk to get illegal guns off the streets and keep *minorities* safe, who have benefited most from the reduction in crime. However, the mayor's tactics have been deemed as racial profiling and a violation of the Fourth Amendment. As a result, the City Council has overridden Bloomberg's veto, creating an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop and frisk and allowing more groups to sue the city for racial profiling. Bloomberg blames the NRA for the world's evils, but his disgust for law-abiding gun owners is misplaced. The NRA has never taken a stance on stop and frisk and advocates for tougher sentencing for possession of *illegal* guns. Bloomberg's other agenda items, such as bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have not reduced crime. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling against stop and frisk, as it is a proven method for making cities safer and protecting the *right* to *privacy* and safety of law-abiding citizens.
END OF SUMMARY.
