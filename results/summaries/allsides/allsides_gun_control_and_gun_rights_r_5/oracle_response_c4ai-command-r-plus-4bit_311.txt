SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent a fortune on his campaign to institute gun bans across America, despite their ineffectiveness in stopping criminals from obtaining firearms. Bloomberg's policing tactic of stop and frisk has been successful in reducing gun violence, but it has also faced criticism and legal challenges. The City Council overrode Bloomberg's veto of bills creating an NYPD inspector general to oversee stop and frisk and allowing more racial profiling lawsuits. Bloomberg argues that the vote puts minorities at risk by hindering crime reduction efforts. The tactic has resulted in the confiscation of thousands of illegal guns and a significant drop in the murder rate. However, critics argue that stop and frisk is a violation of the Fourth Amendment and targets minorities unfairly. Bloomberg's attempts to blame the NRA for the lawsuits are misguided, as the organization has no official stance on stop and frisk. The NRA advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession and enforces the law by prosecuting criminals. Bloomberg's other gun control proposals, such as assault weapon bans and background checks, have failed to reduce crime. The federal appeals court should overturn the ruling against stop and frisk, as it has proven effective in making New York City safer. Bloomberg's disdain for law-abiding gun owners should not overshadow the positive impact of this policing tactic.
END OF SUMMARY.
