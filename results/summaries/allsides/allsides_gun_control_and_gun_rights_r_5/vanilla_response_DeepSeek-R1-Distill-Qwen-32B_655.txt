Okay, I need to summarize this article about New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the stop-and-frisk policy. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by talking about Bloomberg's efforts to implement gun control nationwide, even though his methods haven't stopped criminals from getting guns. He used stop-and-frisk, which helped reduce crime but led to racial profiling issues. The City Council recently overrode his veto to create an inspector general for the NYPD and allow more lawsuits against racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this will put minorities at higher risk since they benefited from crime reduction.

There's a mention of a court ruling that stop-and-frisk violated the Fourth Amendment and was racial profiling. Bloomberg plans to appeal, citing other courts that found it legal. He claims it's been effective, taking 8,000 guns off the streets and cutting the murder rate in half. Supporters like Mike Long from the Conservative Party say it's made NYC safer, especially for minorities, and without it, crime could rise like in Chicago.

Bloomberg also blames the NRA, comparing their influence to the ACLU in opposing stop-and-frisk. However, the NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk. The article criticizes Bloomberg for targeting the NRA, suggesting his policies haven't reduced crime elsewhere. It ends by questioning the court's ruling and suggesting Bloomberg should focus on law-abiding gun owners.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by outlining the key points: Bloomberg's push for gun control, stop-and-frisk's effectiveness and controversy, the City Council's override, the court ruling, Bloomberg's appeal, supporters' arguments, his criticism of the NRA, and the NRA's stance. I should ensure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting too detailed.

Let me draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements concisely. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Also, I need to present both sides: Bloomberg's defense of stop-and-frisk and the criticisms regarding racial profiling and the NRA's role.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has faced criticism over his stop-and-frisk policy, which he claims has reduced crime by seizing 8,000 illegal guns and cutting the murder rate in half. However, a federal court ruled the tactic unconstitutional due to racial profiling, targeting blacks and Hispanics. The City Council recently overrode Bloomberg's veto to create an NYPD inspector general and allow more lawsuits against racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this move puts minorities at higher risk, as they benefited most from crime reduction. He plans to appeal the court ruling, citing other federal courts that deemed stop-and-frisk legal. Supporters, like Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long, credit the policy with making NYC one of the safest cities, particularly for minorities. Bloomberg has also criticized the NRA, linking it to opponents of stop-and-frisk, though the NRA has not taken an official stance on the policy. Critics argue Bloomberg's focus on gun control has not reduced crime elsewhere and question the court's ruling on racial profiling. END OF SUMMARY.
