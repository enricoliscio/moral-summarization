Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words, and I should use as many of them as possible in the summary. The summary needs to be concise, around 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article is about NYC Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to implement gun control and the stop-and-frisk policy. There's conflict between Bloomberg, the City Council, and the judiciary. The author is critical of Bloomberg's tactics and the moral implications of his policies.

Key points:
- Bloomberg spent millions to institute gun bans, which didn't stop criminals, so he used stop-and-frisk.
- The City Council overrode his veto to create an inspector general for the NYPD and allow lawsuits for racial profiling.
- Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, as they benefited from crime reduction.
- A judge ruled stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional, targeting minorities.
- Bloomberg appeals, citing it's legal elsewhere and that stop-and-frisk reduced crime.
- Critics argue Bloomberg is wrong, that NYC already has tough gun laws, and he's targeting the NRA.
- The author questions linking the NRA to the lawsuits, as NRA hasn't taken a stance on stop-and-frisk.
- The article also mentions that other gun control measures haven't reduced crime, so stop-and-frisk is necessary.
- The author suggests the court should overturn the ruling and Bloomberg should stop blaming law-abiding gun owners.

Now, I need to incorporate the morally framed words. Words like "instituted," "stopped," "away," "blame," "overrode," "veto," "allow," "put," "reduction," "taken," "cut," "safer," "saved," "making," "like," "blaming," "link," "protecting," "trump," "wrong," "against," "fight," "remain," "die," "gives," "defending," "law-abiding," "association," "impression," "go," "grabbing," "crime," "checking," "method," "sentencing," "possession," "enforcing," "prosecuting," "having," "reduced," "overturn," "ruling," "taking," "harder," "disgust."

I need to structure the summary to include these words where appropriate. I'll start by outlining the main events and then add the moral framing.

Summary outline:
- Bloomberg tried to institute gun bans but resorted to stop-and-frisk.
- City Council overrode his veto, allowing lawsuits for racial profiling.
- Bloomberg blames this for putting minorities at higher risk, citing crime reduction.
- Judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, targeting minorities.
- Bloomberg appeals, arguing it's legal and effective in reducing crime.
- Critics say he's wrong, NYC has tough laws, and he's fighting the NRA unnecessarily.
- Author questions linking NRA to lawsuits, as they haven't taken a stance.
- Other gun controls haven't reduced crime, so stop-and-frisk is necessary.
- Court should overturn ruling; Bloomberg should stop blaming law-abiding gun owners.

Now, I'll craft the summary using the morally framed words, ensuring it's concise and within 200 words.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions trying to institute gun bans, but criminals continued to get guns, leading him to rely on stop-and-frisk tactics. The City Council recently overrode his veto to create an inspector general for the NYPD and allow lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, as they benefited most from crime reduction. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk unconstitutional, targeting blacks and Hispanics. Bloomberg appealed, arguing it’s legal elsewhere and has reduced crime, saving lives and making NYC safer. Critics argue he’s wrong, as NYC already has tough gun laws, and his fight against the NRA is unnecessary. The author questions linking the NRA to lawsuits, as they haven’t taken a stance on stop-and-frisk. Other gun controls haven’t reduced crime, so stop-and-frisk remains a necessary method. The court should overturn the ruling, and Bloomberg should stop blaming law-abiding gun owners. END OF SUMMARY.
