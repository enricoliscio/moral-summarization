Okay, so I need to summarize this article about New York City's Mayor Bloomberg and the stop-and-frisk policy. Let me read through the article carefully.

First, the article talks about Bloomberg spending a lot of money trying to implement gun bans across America, but these laws haven't stopped criminals. So he used stop-and-frisk to take guns away. But now, the City Council has overridden his veto on two bills. One creates an inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk, and the other allows more people to sue for racial profiling.

Bloomberg thinks this will put minorities at higher risk because they've benefited from crime reduction. A judge ruled stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional, targeting blacks and Hispanics. Bloomberg is appealing, saying it's legal elsewhere and that the policy has reduced crime and taken thousands of illegal guns off the streets.

Mike Long from the Conservative Party supports stop-and-frisk, saying it's saved lives, especially for minorities. He compares the potential loss of the policy to Chicago's situation. Bloomberg blames the NRA for opposition, but Long says Bloomberg's against guns and the NRA without cause.

The article also mentions a columnist linking NRA and ACLU efforts, implying they keep guns on the streets. But the NRA hasn't taken an official stance on stop-and-frisk. They focus on tougher sentences for illegal gun possession. Bloomberg admits the NRA is right about prosecuting criminals.

The article concludes that Bloomberg's policies haven't reduced crime elsewhere, so the stop-and-frisk ban is a mistake. The court should overturn the ruling, and Bloomberg should stop targeting law-abiding gun owners.

Now, I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I'll focus on the key points: Bloomberg's spending, stop-and-frisk's role, the City Council's action, Bloomberg's response, the judge's ruling, support for the policy, Bloomberg's criticism of the NRA, the NRA's actual stance, and the conclusion about the policy's effectiveness.

I should make sure to mention the creation of the inspector general, the lawsuit possibilities, the crime reduction stats, the political moves, and the argument that stop-and-frisk is necessary for safety despite its issues.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring each main point is covered without going over the word limit.

SUMMARY: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions promoting gun control and using stop-and-frisk to reduce crime, despite its controversial nature. Recently, the City Council overrode his veto, creating an inspector general to oversee stop-and-frisk and allowing more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg argues this endangers minorities, who benefited from crime reduction, but a judge ruled the policy unconstitutional due to racial profiling. Bloomberg is appealing, citing its success in reducing crime and seizing thousands of illegal guns. Supporters like Mike Long credit stop-and-frisk with saving lives, especially in minority communities. Bloomberg criticizes the NRA for opposing gun control, but the NRA focuses on tougher sentences for illegal guns, a stance Bloomberg acknowledges. Critics argue stop-and-frisk is necessary for safety, despite its flaws, and that other gun control measures haven't reduced crime. The court should reconsider the ruling, and Bloomberg should avoid targeting law-abiding gun owners. END OF SUMMARY.
