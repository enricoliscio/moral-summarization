SUMMARY:

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun control efforts have been thwarted by the City Council's override of his veto on two bills, which will create a police inspector general and allow more lawsuits for racial profiling. Bloomberg claims this will put minorities at higher risk, as stop-and-frisk tactics have led to 8,000 illegal guns being taken off the streets and a halved murder rate. However, critics argue that Bloomberg's real agenda is to restrict gun ownership, not reduce crime. The NRA, often blamed by Bloomberg, has never taken a stance on stop-and-frisk and advocates for tougher sentencing for illegal gun possession. In reality, Bloomberg's gun ban efforts have failed to stop criminals from getting guns, and his policing tactics are a desperate attempt to compensate. The author argues that the federal appeals court should overturn the ruling that stop-and-frisk is racist, and Bloomberg should re-examine his disdain for law-abiding gun owners.
