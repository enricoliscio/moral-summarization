Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's visit to a mosque, but I have to make sure I preserve the moral framing that the author used. The user also wants me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. 

First, I'll read through the article carefully. The key points are Obama visiting a mosque in the US for the first time, addressing the negative rhetoric against Muslims, especially from Republicans, and emphasizing that Muslims are an essential part of America. He's countering claims that he hasn't been strong enough in fighting extremism and mentions the need for positive media portrayals of Muslims.

For the moral framing words, I'll look for words that carry strong ethical or value-based connotations. Words like "inexcusable," "warped," "belong," "bias," "heartbroken," "Islamophobia," "targeted," "extremism," "conspiracy," "impact," "unwelcome," "torture," and "new beginning" stand out. These words are used to convey the moral stance against discrimination, support for inclusion, and criticism of certain policies or rhetoric.

Now, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping these moral terms. I'll start by mentioning Obama's visit and its purpose to counter negative rhetoric. Then, highlight his message about Muslims being part of America, his criticism of GOP plans, and his call for positive media portrayals. I'll also include the reactions, both positive and negative, from the community and social media. Finally, I'll note his past efforts to improve relations with Muslims globally.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and includes the morally framed words identified. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the visit, his message, the context of political rhetoric, his criticisms, community reactions, and concluding with his broader efforts.

**SUMMARY:**
President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, marking his first visit to a U.S. mosque, to counter "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America, stating, "You're Muslim and American," and criticized GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims. Obama urged acceptance without bias, highlighting the worries of Muslim parents whose children fear being forced out of the country. He also addressed GOP claims that he hasn't been forceful enough in combating extremism, acknowledging the work of Muslim leaders in condemning terrorism. Obama called for more positive depictions of Muslims in media, stating, "Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security." While some praised his visit, others on social media dismissed it as "too late." Obama's visit aimed to repair relations with Muslims globally, following his 2009 Cairo speech seeking a "new beginning" with Muslim countries. END OF SUMMARY.
