SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, seeking to rebut the "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" espoused by Republican presidential candidates. He insisted that Muslims are an essential part of the American fabric and belong in the country just as much as anyone else. Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, arguing that applying religious screens would amplify terrorist messages. He demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias and shared the heartbreaking concerns of young Muslim parents whose children worry about being removed from the country. Obama called for the amplification of Muslim voices condemning terrorism and encouraged positive depictions of Muslims in the media. He aimed to counter Islamophobia and conspiracy theories about his own religious beliefs. While many Muslim groups welcomed his speech, some felt it was too little, too late. Obama's visit to a US mosque, a gesture symbolizing his stance against bigotry and discrimination, was a powerful statement of inclusion and acceptance.
