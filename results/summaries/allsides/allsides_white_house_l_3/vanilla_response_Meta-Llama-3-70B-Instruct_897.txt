SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He aimed to counter "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans, particularly from Republican presidential candidates. Obama emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric, saying "You're Muslim and American" and that they should not be singled out for extra scrutiny. He also urged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and advocated for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. The visit was seen as a response to Islamophobia and a rejection of proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country. Obama's speech was met with both praise and criticism, with some Muslim-Americans feeling it was too little, too late.
