SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He described Muslims as essential to the fabric of America, saying "you fit right here" and "you're part of America too." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only amplify messages coming from terrorist groups. He urged people of all faiths to be accepted without bias, saying "we can't be bystanders to bigotry." Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement. He demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, saying "our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security." END OF SUMMARY.
