SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, seeking to counter what he described as "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He affirmed that Muslims are an essential part of the American fabric and should not be singled out for extra scrutiny or religious screening. Obama encouraged Muslims to speak out against terror and condemned terrorist groups' messages that target people of all faiths. The president demanded that Muslims be accepted without bias and shared the worries of young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country. He also addressed conspiracy theories about his own religious beliefs, noting that he is a Christian and that similar rumors plagued Thomas Jefferson. Obama has previously visited mosques abroad but this was his first visit to a mosque in the United States, which is home to millions of Muslims. Some Muslim-Americans criticized the timing of his visit as too late, while others praised his speech for sharing that Muslims are part of the American fabric.
