Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, addressing issues like Islamophobia and the rhetoric from Republican candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America and condemned singling out Muslims for counterterrorism measures. He also talked about the need to amplify positive contributions of Muslims and the impact of his visit on the community.

I should start the summary by mentioning the visit and its purpose. Then, highlight his message about Muslims being part of America, the criticism of GOP rhetoric, and the emotional impact on Muslim families. I'll include his call to protect all faiths and amplify Muslim voices. Finally, note the mixed reactions and the broader context of his efforts to improve relations.

I need to ensure I use words like rhetoric, terror, clearly, part, bigotry, protect, terrorism, heartbroken, amplify, islamophobia, etc., as per the list. I'll keep each sentence concise to stay under 200 words.

Let me draft the summary step by step, making sure each key moral point is covered without losing the essence of the article.

SUMMARY: President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, addressing "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans and countering GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims. He emphasized Muslims as essential to America, stating, "You're Muslim and American," and condemned singling out Muslims for scrutiny, which could amplify terrorist messages. Obama expressed heartbreak over Muslim children's fears of being forced out of the country and urged acceptance without bias. He called for amplifying Muslim voices condemning terrorism and lifting up their contributions in media. While the visit aimed to combat Islamophobia, some criticized it as "too late." Obama also addressed conspiracy theories suggesting he is Muslim, noting he is not the first to face such claims. His speech highlighted the need to protect all faiths and reject bigotry, while acknowledging the impact of his visit on young Muslims. END OF SUMMARY.
