SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican presidential candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America, saying "you fit right here" and "you're part of America too." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only "reinforce" messages from terrorist groups. He urged people of all faiths to be "accepted" without bias, citing conversations with young Muslim parents whose children are worried about being removed from the country. Obama also demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, saying "we have to... lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community." He emphasized that Muslim leaders are "roundly and repeatedly and consistently condemning terrorism," and that their voices need to be "amplified." Obama's message was clear: "we can't be bystanders to bigotry" and "together, we've got to show that America truly protects all faiths."
