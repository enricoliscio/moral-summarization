Alright, I need to summarize this article about Obama's visit to a mosque. Let me read through the article first. 

Okay, the main points are: Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, it was his first time visiting a mosque in the US. He was addressing anti-Muslim rhetoric from Republicans, especially candidates like Trump. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America, not just Muslim or American, but both. He criticized GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims, saying it plays into terrorist narratives. He also talked about the importance of Muslim leaders speaking out against extremism and the need for positive media portrayals of Muslims. He mentioned the conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, referencing Jefferson too. The visit was a response to calls from Muslim groups to combat Islamophobia, and some people felt it was too late.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key elements: the visit, the purpose, his messages about inclusion, criticism of policies, the media angle, and the conspiracy theories. Also, mention the response from Muslim groups and the mixed reactions.

Let me structure it: Start with the visit and its significance. Then his message about Muslims being part of America. Criticize GOP policies. Mention the media and leadership roles. Touch on conspiracy theories. Note the visit's purpose and reactions, including the hashtag. Keep it concise.

I should make sure to include all these points without going over the word limit. Maybe combine some sentences to save space. Also, ensure clarity and flow.

Let me draft it:

Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, his first US mosque visit, to counter anti-Muslim rhetoric from Republicans. He emphasized Muslims' role in America, criticized targeting Muslims in counterterror, and highlighted the need for positive media portrayals. He addressed conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, referencing Jefferson. The visit aimed to combat Islamophobia, but some felt it was too late.

Wait, that's too short. I need to add more details about his messages, the media part, and the visit's impact.

Revised:

He stressed Muslims' essential role in America, criticized targeting Muslims in counterterror, and urged positive media portrayals. He addressed conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, referencing Jefferson. The visit aimed to combat Islamophobia, but some felt it was too late.

Still a bit short. Maybe add the part about Muslim leaders speaking out.
