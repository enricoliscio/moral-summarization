Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama's visit to a mosque, but I have to make sure I keep the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should preserve as much as possible. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article talks about Obama visiting a mosque in Baltimore, which was his first visit to a mosque in the U.S. He addressed the political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans, especially from Republican candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America and shouldn't be seen as separate. He criticized GOP counterterror plans for singling out Muslims, saying it would help terrorists. He mentioned conversations with Muslim parents worried about their kids being forced out of the country, showing his empathy and concern.

Obama also countered claims that he hasn't been strong enough in demanding Muslim leaders to combat extremism, pointing out that many do condemn terrorism but are often targeted or killed. He wanted to highlight the positive contributions of Muslim-Americans and change media portrayals. The visit was seen as a response to Islamophobia, similar to Bush's visit after 9/11, but it was complicated by conspiracy theories suggesting Obama is Muslim.

Some Muslims felt the visit was too late, but others appreciated it. The summary needs to include as many of the listed moral words as possible, like rhetoric, terror, clearly, part, bigotry, protect, etc. I need to condense this into a 200-word summary without losing the moral essence.

I should start by mentioning the visit and its purpose to counter rhetoric. Highlight his message about Muslims being part of America. Mention his criticism of GOP plans and how it reinforces terrorist messages. Include the parents' worries and his call to protect all faiths. Note the media change and the conspiracy theories. Finally, mention the mixed reactions from the Muslim community.

I need to make sure each sentence includes the moral words where appropriate without making it sound forced. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, his first U.S. mosque visit, to counter "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America, stating, "You're Muslim and American," and criticized GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims, arguing such measures reinforce terrorist messages. Obama expressed empathy for Muslim parents worried about their children being forced out of the country, urging acceptance without bias. He also countered claims he hasn't been forceful in demanding Muslim leaders condemn extremism, noting many do so but are often targeted or killed. Obama called for amplifying these voices and lifting up Muslim contributions in media. The visit aimed to reject Islamophobia, though conspiracy theories suggesting he is Muslim persisted. While some Muslims felt the visit was too late, others appreciated its message that Muslims are part of America's fabric. END OF SUMMARY.
