Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. President Obama visited a mosque in the US for the first time, addressing issues related to Muslim-Americans. He criticized the GOP's rhetoric, especially candidates like Trump proposing bans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America and that singling them out for surveillance is counterproductive. He also talked about the fears of Muslim children and the need to protect all faiths without reinforcing terrorist narratives. He mentioned the importance of amplifying positive contributions of Muslims and addressing Islamophobia, which some people still believe he's a Muslim, even though he's Christian. The visit was a response to earlier calls from Muslim groups and aimed to counter anti-Muslim sentiment.

Now, I need to make sure to include as many of the morally framed words as possible: inexcusable, rhetoric, speak, terror, amplify, bigotry, truly, protects, protect, terrorism, reinforce, accepted, worries, anxieties, forced, treat, banning, condemning, dared, targeted, killed, lift, attacks, share, repair, use.

I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's main points: rebutting GOP rhetoric, emphasizing Muslims' role in America, criticizing counterterror plans, addressing fears of Muslim children, and promoting acceptance. I'll also mention the conspiracy theories and the significance of his visit.

Let me start drafting:

President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, addressing the "inexcusable" political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans, particularly from GOP candidates like Trump. He emphasized Muslims are integral to America, stating they are "Muslim and American." He criticized plans that single out Muslims, arguing they amplify terrorist messages. Obama highlighted the worries of Muslim parents whose children fear being "forced out" and urged acceptance without bias. He condemned terrorism and supported Muslim leaders speaking out against extremism, despite risks. He also called for positive media portrayals of Muslims. The visit aimed to counter Islamophobia and conspiracy theories, despite some Muslims feeling it was "too late."

Wait, I need to include more morally framed words. Let me check: inexcusable, rhetoric, speak, terror, amplify, bigotry, truly, protects, protect, terrorism, reinforce, accepted, worries, anxieties, forced, treat, banning, condemning, dared, targeted, killed, lift, attacks, share, repair, use.

I included inexcusable, rhetoric, amplify, bigotry, protect, terrorism, reinforce, accepted, worries, forced, condemning, targeted. Maybe I can add more, like "truly protects" or "share" and "repair."

Revised: President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, rebutting "inexcusable" political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans, particularly from GOP candidates like Trump. He emphasized Muslims are integral to America, stating they are "Muslim and American," and urged acceptance without bias. Obama criticized counterterror plans that single out Muslims, arguing they amplify terrorist messages and reinforce their narratives. He highlighted the worries and anxieties of Muslim parents whose children fear being "forced out" and demanded they be accepted without bias. Obama condemned terrorism and supported Muslim leaders speaking out against extremism, despite risks of being targeted or killed. He called for positive media portrayals to lift the contributions of Muslim-Americans. The visit aimed to counter Islamophobia and conspiracy theories, despite some Muslims feeling it was "too late."

That should cover many of the moral terms and the key points.
