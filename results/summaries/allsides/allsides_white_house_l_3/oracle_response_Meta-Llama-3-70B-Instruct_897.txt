SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric, saying "you fit right here" and "you're Muslim and American." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only amplify terrorist messages. He urged people of all faiths to be accepted without bias, saying "we can't be bystanders to bigotry" and "we've got to show that America truly protects all faiths." Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror, citing their work in condemning terrorism, and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. He acknowledged the worries and anxieties of young Muslim parents, saying "you could not help but be heartbroken" by their concerns. By visiting the mosque, Obama aimed to counter Islamophobia and show that Muslims are part of America. END OF SUMMARY.
