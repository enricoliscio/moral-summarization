SUMMARY: President Barack Obama made his first visit to a mosque in the United States, seeking to rebuke "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He insisted that Muslims are an essential part of the fabric of America and should not be singled out for extra scrutiny in counterterrorism efforts. Obama decried bigotry and the dangerous threads in political discourse that reinforce terrorist rhetoric. He shared his heartbreak over conversations with young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country and targeted by discrimination. The visit was intended to counter Islamophobia and send a message that Muslims are accepted and protected in America. Obama acknowledged the work of Muslim leaders in condemning terrorism and encouraged more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. Obama's speech was met with mixed reactions, with some Muslim-Americans feeling it was too late, while others felt it sent a powerful message of inclusion. The visit continues Obama's efforts to repair relations with Muslims and counter negative stereotypes. END OF SUMMARY.
