Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author used. The user has already provided the article and the list of morally framed words. First, I should read through the article to understand the main points and the moral stance taken by Obama and the author.

The article talks about Obama visiting a mosque in Baltimore, addressing Muslim-Americans. He's countering Republican rhetoric, especially from Trump, who wanted to ban Muslims. Obama emphasizes that Muslims are an essential part of America, not separate. He condemns GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims, saying it amplifies terrorist messages. He also mentions the worries of Muslim parents about their children being targeted, highlighting the need to protect all faiths and not reinforce terrorist rhetoric.

I need to include the morally charged words: inexcusable, rhetoric, speak, terror, amplify, bigotry, truly, protects, protect, terrorism, reinforce, accepted, worries, anxieties, forced, treat, banning, condemning, dared, targeted, killed, lift, attacks, share, repair, use.

I should structure the summary to cover Obama's visit, his message against the GOP rhetoric, the impact on Muslim communities, and the broader implications of his speech. I'll need to make sure to include the key moral points without going over 200 words.

I'll start by stating the visit and its purpose. Then mention the GOP candidates' rhetoric, especially Trump's ban. Highlight Obama's message that Muslims are integral to America. Then address the counterterror plans and how they amplify terrorism. Include the worries of parents and the need to protect against bigotry. Mention the need for Muslim leaders to condemn terrorism and the importance of positive media portrayals. Finally, note the mixed reactions, including criticism about the visit being too late.

I should make sure to use the morally framed words where appropriate without forcing them. Let me draft a concise version, keeping each sentence focused on a moral aspect and ensuring the word count stays under 200.

SUMMARY: President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore to counter "inexcusable" Republican rhetoric targeting Muslim-Americans, emphasizing their integral role in America. He condemned GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims, warning they amplify terrorist messages. Obama addressed the "worries" and "anxieties" of Muslim parents whose children fear being "forced out" or "treated" unfairly, urging acceptance without bias. He criticized the idea of "banning" Muslims, highlighting the need to "protect" all faiths and not "reinforce" terrorist rhetoric. Obama praised Muslim leaders for "condemning" terrorism but called for more "dared" voices to be amplified. He urged positive media portrayals of Muslims, beyond national security, to "lift" their contributions. Despite his efforts, some Muslims deemed the visit "too late." Obama's speech aimed to "share" the message that Muslims are part of America's fabric, countering "bigotry" and "attacks" on their identity. END OF SUMMARY.
