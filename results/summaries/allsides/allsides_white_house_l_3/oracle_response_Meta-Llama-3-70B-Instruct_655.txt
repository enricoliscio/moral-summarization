SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric, saying "you're not Muslim or American. You're Muslim and American." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only amplify terrorist messages. He urged people of all faiths to be accepted without bias, saying "we can't be bystanders to bigotry" and "together, we've got to show that America truly protects all faiths." Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement. He demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, saying "we have to lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community." The visit aimed to counter GOP claims that Obama hasn't been forceful enough in demanding that Muslim leaders help root out extremism. END OF SUMMARY.
