SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric and should not be singled out for extra scrutiny. Obama criticized GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims, saying they amplify terrorist groups' messages. He also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. The visit was seen as a public rejection of Islamophobia, and Obama's speech was met with both praise and criticism. Many Muslim-Americans felt the visit was long overdue, while others saw it as a step in the right direction. Obama's message was clear: "You're Muslim and American," and America should protect all faiths without bias.
