SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric, saying "You're not Muslim or American. You're Muslim and American." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would amplify terrorist messages. He urged people to "show that America truly protects all faiths" and to "lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community." Obama's speech was a forceful counterpoint to Republican presidential candidates like Donald Trump, who has proposed banning all Muslims from entering the country. The President also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement. By visiting the mosque, Obama aimed to combat Islamophobia and bigotry, saying "We can't be bystanders to bigotry."
