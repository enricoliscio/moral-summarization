SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, to combat Islamophobia and promote tolerance towards Muslim-Americans. He condemned "inexcusable political rhetoric" from Republican presidential candidates and emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric. Obama urged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and encouraged Americans to accept people of all faiths without bias. He also called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media, citing a long history of Islam in America. The visit was seen as a rejection of Islamophobia and a move to counter GOP claims that Obama hasn't been forceful enough in demanding Muslim leaders help root out extremism. Obama's speech was a forceful counterpoint to language favored by some Republican candidates, and he emphasized that applying religious screens would only amplify terrorist messages.

END OF SUMMARY.
