Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama visiting a mosque in the US. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article talks about Obama addressing the negative rhetoric against Muslims, especially from Republicans, and emphasizing that Muslims are an essential part of America. He also criticized GOP counterterrorism plans that target Muslims. 

I should start by identifying the key points: the visit was his first to a US mosque, his message about Muslims being part of America, criticizing the GOP, addressing the fear among Muslim children, and the broader context of his efforts to improve relations with the Muslim community.

I need to make sure the summary reflects the moral stance against discrimination and the promotion of inclusion. Also, note the reaction from Muslim groups and the political context, like the conspiracy theories about Obama being Muslim.

I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well. Let me structure it by first stating the visit and its purpose, then his messages, followed by the context and reactions.

Wait, did I include that he mentioned the media's role in positive depictions? That's important for the moral framing. Also, the hashtag #TooLateObama shows some skepticism, which is a valid point to include.

I think that's all. Time to put it together clearly and succinctly.

SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, marking his first visit to a U.S. mosque, to address "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America, stating, "You're Muslim and American," and criticized GOP counterterrorism plans that target Muslims, arguing such measures amplify terrorist narratives. Obama also addressed the fears of Muslim children being forced out of the country, calling for acceptance without bias. He highlighted the contributions of Muslim-Americans and urged media to portray them positively, not just in times of crisis. The visit was seen as a response to Islamophobia and conspiracy theories about his faith, with some Muslim groups welcoming the gesture but others expressing skepticism with the hashtag #TooLateObama. END OF SUMMARY.
