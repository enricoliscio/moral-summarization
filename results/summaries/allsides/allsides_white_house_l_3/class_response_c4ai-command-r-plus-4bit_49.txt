SUMMARY: President Barack Obama, during his first visit to a mosque in the United States, strongly criticized the "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. Obama sought to challenge the distorted view of Islam and encouraged Muslims to speak out against terror. He emphasized that Muslims are an integral part of the American fabric and that religious discrimination amplifies the messages of terrorist groups. Obama condemned GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims and reaffirmed the need to protect all faiths while fighting terrorism. He shared his heartbreak over conversations with young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country due to biased attitudes. Obama also recognized the efforts of Muslim leaders in condemning terrorism and called for their voices to be amplified. The President highlighted Islam's long history in America and advocated for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. Obama's visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore sent a clear message of acceptance and tolerance, rejecting Islamophobia and promoting the inclusion of Muslim-Americans in the nation's fabric.
