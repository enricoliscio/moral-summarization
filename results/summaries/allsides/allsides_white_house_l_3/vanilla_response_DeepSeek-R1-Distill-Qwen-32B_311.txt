Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama visiting a mosque in the US. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

First, the article mentions that this was Obama's first visit to a mosque in the US. He aimed to counter the negative rhetoric from Republican candidates, especially regarding Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America and shouldn't be seen as 'either/or' but 'both'â€”Muslim and American.

He criticized GOP counterterrorism plans that target Muslims, saying it could help terrorists. He also talked about conversations with Muslim parents worried about their children being deported, highlighting the need to accept people of all faiths without bias.

Obama addressed the issue of media representation, wanting more positive portrayals of Muslims. He also mentioned his past visits to mosques abroad but never in the US, which was a point some Muslim groups had pushed for. Despite conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, he used the visit to show solidarity and address those concerns.

Some Muslims felt the visit was too late, but others appreciated it. The summary should include these key points: the visit's purpose, countering rhetoric, emphasizing Muslim-American identity, criticizing surveillance policies, addressing parents' fears, media representation, and the broader impact of the visit.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all these elements without going into too much detail. Let me structure it to flow logically from his visit, his message, the criticism of policies, the personal stories, media, and the overall impact and reactions.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text. Also, the user wants the summary after a "SUMMARY:" token and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." So I'll format it accordingly.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and covers all main points clearly.
