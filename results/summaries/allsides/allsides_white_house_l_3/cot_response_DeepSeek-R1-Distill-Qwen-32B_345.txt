Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert. They provided a news article about President Obama visiting a mosque and his speech addressing Islamophobia and the rhetoric against Muslim-Americans. 

First, I need to break down the task. They have two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary preserving those words. 

Starting with Step 1, I need to go through the article and pick out all the single words that carry moral connotations. Words like "inexcusable," "warped," "discrimination," "bigotry," etc., stand out because they express judgment or moral evaluation. I'll list each of these words, each on a new line with a *.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article while keeping as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the essence of Obama's message: affirming Muslims' place in America, criticizing anti-Muslim rhetoric, and addressing the need for inclusion and combating extremism without discrimination.

I should also note the context, like his past efforts and the timing of the visit, as well as the mixed reactions from the Muslim community. This shows the complexity of his position and the significance of the visit.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, includes key points, and maintains the moral framing from the original text. I'll start with the main action (visit and speech), then touch on the key moral points, and conclude with the impact and reactions.

Let me structure it: mention the visit, the main message, criticism of GOP rhetoric, the emotional aspect with children's fears, the call for amplifying positive voices, and the mixed reception. Keep it within 200 words, making sure to include the morally charged words identified earlier.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's clear, concise, and retains the moral elements as required.
