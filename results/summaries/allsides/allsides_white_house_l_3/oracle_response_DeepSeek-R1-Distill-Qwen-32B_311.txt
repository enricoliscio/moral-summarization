Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and a list of morally framed words. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, addressing issues like Islamophobia and the rhetoric against Muslims from Republicans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America and criticized policies that single them out. He also talked about the need for positive depictions in media and mentioned conspiracy theories about him being Muslim.

Now, I need to make sure the summary includes as many of the listed moral words as possible. Words like rhetoric, terror, clearly, part, bigotry, protect, terrorism, heartbroken, worries, anxieties, forced, targeted, killed, amplify, lift, Islamophobia, theories, visit, worry, standing, bullying, share. I should structure the summary to cover Obama's visit, his message against Islamophobia, the context of Republican rhetoric, the impact on Muslim families, and the broader implications of his speech. I'll need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows naturally while including those moral terms. I'll start by outlining the key points and then weave in the moral language.

SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, addressing "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans and countering GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims. He emphasized Muslims as essential to America, stating, "You're Muslim and American," and criticized policies that amplify terrorist messages. Obama condemned bigotry, urging unity to protect all faiths and reject Islamophobia. He shared heartbroken conversations with Muslim parents worried about their children being forced out of the country, highlighting the need to amplify Muslim voices and lift their contributions. Obama also addressed conspiracy theories suggesting he is Muslim, noting he is "in good company" with historical figures like Thomas Jefferson. His visit aimed to counter Islamophobia and show Muslims as part of America's fabric, though some criticized it as too late. END OF SUMMARY.
