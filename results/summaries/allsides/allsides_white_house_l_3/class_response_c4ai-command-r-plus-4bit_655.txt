SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, his first visit to a mosque in the United States, to address "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He sought to recast the warped image of Islam and encourage Muslims to speak out against terror. Obama emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of the fabric of America and belong in the country. He decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny and insisted that applying religious screens would amplify terrorist messages. Obama advocated against dangerous threads in political discourse, stating that America must protect all faiths and not reinforce the rhetoric of terrorists. He shared the worries and anxieties of young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country and demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias. Obama recognized the work of Muslim leaders in condemning terrorism and called for their voices to be amplified. He also cited the long history of Islam in America and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. While Obama has visited mosques abroad, this visit was significant in addressing Islamophobia and sending a message of acceptance and inclusion for Muslim-Americans.
END OF SUMMARY.
