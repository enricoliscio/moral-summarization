Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama visiting a mosque in the US. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article starts by mentioning Obama's first visit to a US mosque, aiming to counter anti-Muslim rhetoric from Republicans. He emphasizes that Muslims are an essential part of America and shouldn't be seen as 'either/or' but 'both.' He criticizes GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims, saying it plays into terrorist narratives. He also talks about conversations with Muslim parents worried about their children being deported, highlighting the need to protect all faiths without bias.

Obama addresses claims that he hasn't been forceful enough in demanding Muslim leaders combat extremism. He acknowledges that Muslim leaders do condemn terrorism but says their voices need amplification. He also calls for more positive media portrayals of Muslims, not just in crisis situations. The visit was significant because he had avoided US mosques for seven years, partly due to conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, which 29% of Americans still believed.

The article mentions that some Muslims felt the visit was too late, using the hashtag #TooLateObama. Overall, the visit was meant to show solidarity and counter Islamophobia, similar to George W. Bush's post-9/11 visit.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral framing intact. I'll focus on the key points: the visit's purpose, Obama's messages about Muslim identity and counterterrorism, the criticism of GOP policies, the personal stories of Muslim parents, the media portrayal, and the context of conspiracy theories and public perception.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects, like standing against bigotry, protecting all faiths, and the importance of Muslim contributions. Also, mention the criticism that the visit was overdue.

Let me structure the summary step by step:

1. Introduction: Obama's first US mosque visit to counter anti-Muslim rhetoric.
2. His message: Muslims are integral to America, not 'either/or,' criticizing GOP policies.
3. Personal stories: Concerns of Muslim parents about their children.
4. Addressing criticism: Muslim leaders do speak out against extremism.
5. Media portrayal: Need for positive depictions.
6. Context: Conspiracy theories, visit's significance, and mixed reactions.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and within the word limit.
