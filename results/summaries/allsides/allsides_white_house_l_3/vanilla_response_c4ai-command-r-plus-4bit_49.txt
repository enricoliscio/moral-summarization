SUMMARY: In his first visit to a mosque in the United States, President Barack Obama sought to counter what he described as "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. Obama insisted that Muslims are an essential part of the American fabric and that religious screening would only amplify the messages of terrorist groups. He also called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media and encouraged Muslim leaders to continue speaking out against terror. Obama's visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore was meant to send a message of support to the Muslim-American community, which has faced increasing discrimination and hostility. The President acknowledged the work of Islamic centers in condemning terrorism but also identified areas for improvement, such as amplifying the voices of moderate Muslims. Obama's speech also addressed conspiracy theories about his own religious beliefs, as well as the impact of bullying and discrimination on young Muslims. While many praised the President's speech, some Muslim-Americans felt it was too little, too late.
