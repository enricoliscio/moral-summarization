Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Obama visiting a mosque. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. So, I should focus on the main points and the underlying messages.

First, the article is about Obama's first visit to a mosque in the U.S. during his presidency. He's addressing the negative rhetoric against Muslims, especially from Republican candidates. That's a key moral pointâ€”condemning bigotry and promoting inclusion.

He emphasizes that Muslims are an essential part of America, both Muslim and American. That's a strong moral statement about belonging and identity. Also, he criticizes GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims, arguing it plays into terrorist narratives. That's another moral angle about not reinforcing extremism.

He mentions conversations with Muslim parents worried about their children being deported. This highlights the emotional impact on families and the need for acceptance without bias. It's a moral appeal to protect vulnerable communities.

Obama also addresses the media's role, wanting more positive portrayals of Muslims. This is about representation and challenging stereotypes, which is a moral call for fairness and diversity in media.

He acknowledges conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, showing solidarity with the community despite personal attacks. That adds depth to his moral stance on unity.

Lastly, the visit was seen as too late by some, indicating ongoing issues. This reflects the broader struggle for acceptance and the need for continuous effort.

Putting it all together, the summary should capture Obama's moral arguments against discrimination, promotion of inclusion, criticism of counterterror policies, support for Muslim voices, and the broader implications of his visit.
