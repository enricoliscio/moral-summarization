SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to counter "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to America's fabric, saying "you fit right here... you're Muslim and American." Obama rejected GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims, arguing they would amplify terrorist messages. He advocated for acceptance of all faiths without bias, citing conversations with worried young Muslim parents. Obama also acknowledged that Muslim leaders have consistently condemned terrorism, but more needs to be done to amplify their voices. He called for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, highlighting the long history of Islam in America. The visit aimed to counter Islamophobia and promote a more inclusive America, where all faiths are protected and respected.
