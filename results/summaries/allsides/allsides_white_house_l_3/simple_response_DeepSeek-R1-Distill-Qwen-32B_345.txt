Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first.

The article is about President Obama visiting a mosque in the US for the first time. He's addressing the issue of anti-Muslim rhetoric from Republican candidates, especially Trump. He's trying to counter that by emphasizing that Muslims are an essential part of America. He says they're both Muslim and American, not one or the other. He also talks about how singling out Muslims for extra scrutiny would help terrorists.

He mentions conversations with Muslim parents worried about their kids being forced out of the country. That's a strong emotional point. He also addresses the media's role in portraying Muslims positively, not just in relation to national security. He's visiting the mosque to counter Islamophobia and conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, which 29% of Americans believe.

The summary needs to capture the moral aspects: promoting inclusivity, rejecting bigotry, and countering Islamophobic rhetoric. It should also mention his efforts to amplify positive Muslim contributions and the reaction from Muslim groups, some saying it's too late.

I need to keep it under 200 words and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." I'll structure it by highlighting his main points: rebutting anti-Muslim rhetoric, emphasizing Muslim Americans' role, addressing GOP policies, mentioning the parents' concerns, and his broader efforts. I'll also note the conspiracy theories and the mixed reactions from the community.

Let me make sure I include all key points without going over the word limit. I'll focus on the moral stance he's taking and the actions he's advocating for, like amplifying Muslim voices and positive media portrayals.
