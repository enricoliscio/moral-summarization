SUMMARY: In his first visit to a mosque in the United States, President Barack Obama strongly rebuked the "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" espoused by Republican presidential candidates. Obama's visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore was intended to send a clear message of inclusion and acceptance towards the Muslim community, stating that they are "part of America". He denounced GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny and emphasized the need to amplify the voices of Muslim leaders who condemn terrorism. Obama acknowledged the long history of Islam in America and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media and in popular culture. The visit was seen as a response to conspiracy theories and Islamophobia, with Obama standing in solidarity with the Muslim community and affirming their rightful place in the American fabric. However, some Muslim-Americans felt that the visit was too little, too late, using the hashtag #TooLateObama to express their disappointment. Nonetheless, Obama's speech was well-received by many, including young Muslims who face bullying and discrimination due to their faith.
