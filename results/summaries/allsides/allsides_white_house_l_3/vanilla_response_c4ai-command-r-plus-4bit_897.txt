SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He sought to counter what he called "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates and to encourage members of the Islamic faith to speak out against terrorism. Obama emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of the fabric of America and should not be singled out for extra scrutiny based on their religion. He also called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media and in popular culture. Obama has previously visited mosques outside of the United States, but this was his first visit to a mosque in America, which is home to 2.75 million Muslims. The visit was seen as a public rejection of Islamophobia, but some Muslim-Americans felt it was too late in coming. Obama has been dogged by conspiracy theories that he is a Muslim, though he is a Christian.
