SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America, saying "you fit right here" and "you're part of America too." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only amplify messages from terrorist groups. He demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias into the United States, saying "we can't be bystanders to bigotry." Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement. His speech aimed to counter Islamophobia and promote a more positive depiction of Muslims in American media. END OF SUMMARY.
