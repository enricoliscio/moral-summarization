SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican presidential candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America, saying "you fit right here" and "you're part of America too." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only "amplify" messages from terrorist groups. He urged people of all faiths to be "accepted" without bias and demanded that "bigotry" be countered. Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to "speak out" against terror and praised their efforts, citing the need to "lift up" the contributions of Muslim-Americans. He warned against "reinforcing" terrorist ideologies and emphasized the importance of "protecting" all faiths. By visiting the mosque, Obama aimed to "repair" relations with Muslims and promote a more inclusive America. END OF SUMMARY.
