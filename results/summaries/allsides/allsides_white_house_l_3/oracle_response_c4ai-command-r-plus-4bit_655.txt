SUMMARY: In his first visit to a mosque in the United States, President Barack Obama sought to address and condemn the "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" espoused by Republican presidential candidates. He reaffirmed the essential role of Muslims in the fabric of America and rejected the notion of religious screening as a counterterrorism strategy, arguing that it would only amplify the messages of terrorist groups. Obama demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias and shared the worries of young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country due to discrimination. He acknowledged the work of Muslim leaders in condemning terrorism and called for their voices to be amplified, while also recognizing the long history of Islam in America. The President aimed to challenge Islamophobia and conspiracy theories about his own religious beliefs, standing in solidarity with the Muslim community and affirming that Muslims belong in America. Obama's speech aimed to send a powerful message against bigotry and in favor of religious freedom and inclusion.
