Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points and the moral language used.

The article is about President Obama visiting a mosque in the U.S. for the first time. He addresses the negative rhetoric against Muslims, especially from Republican candidates. He emphasizes that Muslims are an essential part of America and condemns policies that target them, saying they reinforce terrorist messages. He also talks about the worries of Muslim children and the importance of amplifying positive Muslim contributions in media.

The author uses words like "rhetoric," "terror," "bigotry," "protects," "terrorism," "heartbroken," "condemning," "targeted," "amplify," "islamophobia," etc. I need to make sure these words are included in the summary.

I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's main points: rebutting anti-Muslim rhetoric, emphasizing Muslims' role in America, condemning policies that target Muslims, addressing the fears of Muslim families, and the importance of positive media representation. Also, mention the visit's significance and the mixed reactions.

I need to keep it concise, around 200 words. Let me start by outlining the key points and then craft the summary, ensuring all the moral terms are included.

SUMMARY: President Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, addressing "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans and countering GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims. He emphasized Muslims' essential role in America, stating, "You fit right here," and condemned bigotry, urging unity against terrorism. Obama expressed "heartbreak" over Muslim children's fears of being "forced out" and called for amplifying Muslim contributions in media. He acknowledged conspiracy theories about his faith, citing historical precedents, and highlighted the importance of Muslim leaders condemning terrorism. The visit aimed to combat "islamophobia" and reassure Muslim-Americans, though some criticized it as "too late." Obama's message sought to "protect" all faiths and "share" the idea that Muslims are part of America's fabric. END OF SUMMARY.
