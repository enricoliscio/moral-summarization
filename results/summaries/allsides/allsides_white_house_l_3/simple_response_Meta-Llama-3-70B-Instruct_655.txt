SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to counter "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric and should not be singled out for extra scrutiny. Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would target Muslims, saying it would only amplify terrorist messages. He advocated for acceptance of people of all faiths without bias and urged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror. Obama also called for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, citing a long history of Islam in America. The visit was seen as a rejection of Islamophobia, and many Muslim groups had called for him to schedule a stop at a U.S. mosque. While some criticized the visit as too late, others saw it as a powerful message of acceptance and inclusion.
