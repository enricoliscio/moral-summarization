SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican presidential candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America, saying "you fit right here" and "you're Muslim and American." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only "amplify" messages from terrorist groups. He urged people of all faiths to be "accepted without bias" into the United States, condemning "bigotry" and emphasizing that America "truly protects all faiths." Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to "speak out" against terror, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement. He demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, saying "we have to... lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community." END OF SUMMARY.
