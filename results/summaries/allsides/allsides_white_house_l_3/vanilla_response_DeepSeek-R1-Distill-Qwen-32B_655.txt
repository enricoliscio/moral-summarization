Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Obama's visit to a mosque in the US. The user wants a concise summary, no longer than 200 words, and it needs to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, his first US mosque visit. He addressed anti-Muslim rhetoric from Republicans, especially Trump. He emphasized Muslims are an essential part of America and condemned policies targeting Muslims. He also talked about the importance of Muslim leaders speaking out against extremism and the need for positive media portrayals.

I should include the key points: the visit, the message against Islamophobia, the political context, and the impact on the community. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and flows well.

Let me structure it: start with the visit, his message, the political backdrop, the encouragement for Muslim leaders, and the media aspect. Also, mention the timing and reactions, like the hashtag #TooLateObama.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point but cover all main aspects succinctly. Make sure to highlight his emphasis on inclusion and the broader implications for American values.

Okay, putting it all together, ensuring it's clear and within the word limit.
