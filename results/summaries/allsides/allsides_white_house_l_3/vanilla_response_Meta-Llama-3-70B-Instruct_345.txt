SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, to rebuke "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans, particularly from Republican presidential candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric and should not be subjected to extra scrutiny or bias. Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims, saying they amplify terrorist messages. He encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. The visit was seen as a forceful counterpoint to language favored by some Republican candidates, such as Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country. Many Muslim groups had called for Obama to visit a US mosque to reject Islamophobia, and while some welcomed his message, others felt it was too late in coming.
