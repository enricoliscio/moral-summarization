SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He described Muslims as essential to the fabric of America and insisted that religious screening would only amplify terrorist messages. Obama advocated against dangerous threads in political discourse, saying, "We can't be bystanders to bigotry." He demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias and shared his heartbreak over conversations with young Muslim parents whose children worry about being removed from the country. Obama also cited the long history of Islam in America and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. The visit was a response to Muslim groups' requests for a public rejection of Islamophobia and a stand against conspiracy theories that Obama is a Muslim. Obama's speech aimed to amplify the voices of Muslim leaders condemning terrorism and to show that Muslims are "part of America too."
