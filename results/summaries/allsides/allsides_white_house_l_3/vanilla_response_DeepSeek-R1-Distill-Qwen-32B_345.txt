Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Obama visiting a mosque in the US. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points. 

So, the article is about President Obama's first visit to a mosque in the US. He's addressing the issue of negative rhetoric towards Muslim-Americans, especially from Republican candidates. He emphasizes that Muslims are an essential part of America and condemns singling them out for counterterrorism measures. 

He talks about the importance of amplifying Muslim voices against terrorism and mentions the contributions of the Muslim-American community. He also addresses conspiracy theories about him being Muslim and the impact of his visit on young Muslims. 

The summary needs to be concise, under 200 words. I should include key points: the visit, the purpose, his message about Muslims being part of America, criticism of GOP policies, amplifying Muslim voices, and the significance of the visit despite some criticism. 

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all the main aspects without going into too much detail. Let me structure it: start with the visit, his message, the political context, his call to action, and the significance. 

I should avoid jargon and keep it clear. Also, remember to end with the specified tokens.
