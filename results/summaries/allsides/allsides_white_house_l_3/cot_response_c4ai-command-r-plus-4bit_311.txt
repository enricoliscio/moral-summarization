SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. In his speech, he sought to rebut what he called "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. Obama decried the warped image of Islam propagated by some and encouraged Muslims to speak out against terror. He advocated against bigotry and for the protection of all faiths, warning against reinforcing the rhetoric of terrorists. Obama demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias and shared the heartbreaking anxieties of young Muslim parents whose children worry about being removed from the country. He offered a forceful counterpoint to the language and claims of GOP candidates and insisted that Muslims are an essential part of the fabric of America. The President lifted up the contributions of the Muslim-American community and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. He also acknowledged the complicated nature of his visit, alluding to conspiracy theories that have plagued him and Thomas Jefferson. While some Muslim-Americans welcomed the visit as a profound gesture, others dismissed it as #TooLateObama. Obama's speech addressed the need to amplify Muslim voices condemning terrorism and acknowledged the targeting and bullying faced by the community. END OF SUMMARY.
