SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican presidential candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America, saying "you fit right here" and "you're part of America too." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only "amplify" messages from terrorist groups. He urged people of all faiths to be "accepted without bias" into the United States, citing conversations with young Muslim parents whose children are worried about being removed from the country. Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to "speak out" against terror, acknowledging that many have already done so and been "targeted" and even "killed" for it. He emphasized the need to "lift up" the contributions of Muslim-Americans and to "repair" relations with Muslims abroad.
