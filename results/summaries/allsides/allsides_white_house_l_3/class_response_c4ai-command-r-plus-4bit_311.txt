SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He strongly condemned the "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" coming from Republican presidential candidates, characterizing it as bigotry. Obama sought to recast the warped image of Islam, emphasizing that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America and belong in the country just as much as anyone else. He also encouraged Muslims to speak out against terror and rejected the idea of religious screening, arguing that it would amplify terrorist messages. Obama highlighted the contributions of the Muslim-American community and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. He acknowledged the work of Islamic centers in condemning terrorism while urging for more to be done to amplify these voices. The President's visit and speech were intended to send a message of acceptance and protection for all faiths, countering the dangerous threads in the political discourse, such as proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country. However, some Muslim-Americans felt that the visit was too late in coming. END OF SUMMARY.
