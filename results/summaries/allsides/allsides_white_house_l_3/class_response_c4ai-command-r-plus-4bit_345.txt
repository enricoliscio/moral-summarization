SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, to send a clear message against what he sees as dangerous and inexcusable rhetoric against Muslim-Americans from some Republican presidential candidates. He sought to recast Islam's warped image and encourage Muslims to speak out against terror. Obama emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of the American fabric and belong in the country. He decried GOP counterterrorism plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny and insisted that applying religious screens would amplify terrorist messages. Obama demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias in the United States, addressing the worries and anxieties of young Muslim parents whose children fear being forced out of the country. He also highlighted the consistent condemnation of terrorism by Muslim leaders and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the American media. Obama's visit to a U.S. mosque, home to millions of Muslims, was seen as a public rejection of Islamophobia. While some Muslim-Americans felt the visit was too late, others believed it sent a powerful message that Muslims are part of America's fabric.
