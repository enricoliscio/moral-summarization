SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America, saying "You're not Muslim or American. You're Muslim and American." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only amplify messages from terrorist groups. He demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias into the United States, saying "We can't be bystanders to bigotry." Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement. He called for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, saying "Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security." END OF SUMMARY.
