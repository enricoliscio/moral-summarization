SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. Obama sought to counter what he described as "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" and to reassure Muslims that they are an essential part of the American fabric. He condemned the idea of applying religious screens when it comes to counterterrorism efforts, arguing that it would only amplify the messages of terrorist groups. Obama also addressed the concerns of young Muslim parents whose children worry about being removed from the country due to bias and discrimination. The President demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias in the United States. He acknowledged the work of Muslim leaders in condemning terrorism and encouraged the amplification of these voices. Obama's visit was meant to send a message of support and inclusion to the Muslim community and to counter Islamophobia. The President has previously visited mosques abroad and delivered a speech in Cairo seeking a "new beginning" with Muslim countries.
