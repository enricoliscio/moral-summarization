SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, condemning "inexcusable" political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric, saying "you fit right here" and "you're Muslim and American." Obama criticized GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, arguing that they amplify terrorist messages. He advocated for acceptance of people of all faiths without bias, sharing heart-wrenching conversations with young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country. Obama also acknowledged the need for Muslim leaders to help root out extremism, while citing their condemnation of terrorism. He called for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, emphasizing their contributions to the country. The visit was seen as a long-overdue rejection of Islamophobia, with many Muslim groups welcoming the move.
