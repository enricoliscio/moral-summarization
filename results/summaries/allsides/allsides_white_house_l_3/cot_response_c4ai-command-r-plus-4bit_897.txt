SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited the Islamic Society of Baltimore in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He sought to counter what he described as "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny and insisted that applying religious screens would only amplify messages from terrorist groups. He also demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias in the United States, expressing heartbreak over conversations with young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country. Obama's speech aimed to send a forceful counterpoint to the language and claims of Republican candidates and to counter GOP assertions that he hasn't demanded enough from Muslim leaders to root out extremism. He acknowledged the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. Obama's visit was seen by some Muslim-Americans as too late, but others believed it sent a powerful message that Muslims are part of the fabric of America. The president's speech also reflected his desire to repair relations with Muslims abroad and address past grievances, including the use of torture on terror suspects. END OF SUMMARY.
