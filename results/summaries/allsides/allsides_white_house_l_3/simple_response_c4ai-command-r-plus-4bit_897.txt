SUMMARY: In his first visit to a mosque in the United States, President Barack Obama sought to counter what he described as "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He delivered a powerful message of inclusion and acceptance, stating that Muslims are an essential part of the fabric of America and belong just as much as any other religious group. Obama condemned GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny and argued that applying religious screens would only amplify the messages of terrorist groups. He also called for a more positive depiction of Muslims in the media and in popular culture. The visit was seen as a public rejection of Islamophobia, similar to the stance taken by President George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Obama's speech was met with mixed reactions, with some Muslim-Americans praising his message of inclusion, while others felt it was too little, too late. Throughout his presidency, Obama has been dogged by conspiracy theories and rumors that he is a Muslim, highlighting the challenges of addressing Islamophobia in the United States.
