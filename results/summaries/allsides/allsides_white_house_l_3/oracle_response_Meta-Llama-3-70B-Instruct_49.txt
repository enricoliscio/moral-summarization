SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric, saying "you're not Muslim or American. You're Muslim and American." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only amplify terrorist messages. He urged people of all faiths to be accepted without bias, saying "we can't be bystanders to bigotry." Obama also demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media, citing a long history of Islam in America. He acknowledged that Muslim leaders have consistently condemned terrorism, but emphasized the need to amplify their voices. Obama's visit was seen as a rejection of Islamophobia, with many Muslim groups welcoming his message. However, some critics felt the visit was too little, too late.
