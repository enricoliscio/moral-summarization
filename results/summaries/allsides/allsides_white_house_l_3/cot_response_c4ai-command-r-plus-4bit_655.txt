SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He sought to counter what he described as "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. Obama's speech aimed to recast the warped image of Islam and encourage Muslims to speak out against terror. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America and should not be singled out for extra scrutiny. Obama decried the dangerous threads of political discourse that promote bigotry and reinforce the rhetoric of terrorists. He shared the anxieties of young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country due to biased and hateful language. Obama's visit and speech aimed to amplify the voices of Muslims condemning terrorism and lift up their contributions to American society. He acknowledged the history of Islam in America and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media, unrelated to national security. This visit was a powerful gesture of support for the Muslim community, but some felt it was too late in coming. Obama's words and actions demonstrated his commitment to repairing relations with Muslims and countering Islamophobia.
