Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, addressing the negative rhetoric against Muslims from Republicans. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America, countering claims that they should be banned or monitored. He also discussed the need for Muslim leaders to speak out against terrorism and for media to positively portray Muslims. The visit was seen as a response to Islamophobia and conspiracy theories about his own faith.

Now, I'll identify the key morally charged words from the list provided: inexcusable, rhetoric, speak, terror, amplify, bigotry, truly, protects, protect, terrorism, reinforce, accepted, worries, anxieties, forced, treat, banning, condemning, dared, targeted, killed, lift, attacks, share, repair, use.

I'll structure the summary to include these words naturally. I'll start by mentioning Obama's visit and his rebuttal of inexcusable rhetoric. Highlight his message that Muslims are an essential part of America, countering the rhetoric. Then, address the GOP's counterterror plans and how they amplify terrorist messages. Mention his call to protect against terrorism without reinforcing the terrorists' ideas. Include the worries and anxieties of Muslim parents, the idea of banning Muslims, and the need for Muslim leaders to condemn terrorism. Finally, touch on the media's role in lifting contributions of Muslims and the impact of his visit despite some criticism.

I'll make sure each sentence flows well and includes the necessary moral terms without forcing them. The summary should be clear, concise, and capture the essence of the article while adhering to the word limit.

SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America, stating, "You fit right here," and condemned plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, arguing such measures would amplify terrorist messages. Obama urged Muslims to speak out against terrorism and highlighted the importance of protecting America without reinforcing terrorist rhetoric. He expressed concern over Muslim parents' worries and anxieties about their children being forced out of the country, calling for acceptance without bias. Obama also criticized GOP claims that he hasn't been forceful enough in demanding Muslim leaders condemn extremism, noting that Muslim leaders are already speaking out, even risking being targeted or killed. He called for more positive depictions of Muslims in media, urging the U.S. to truly protect all faiths and lift up Muslim contributions. Despite conspiracy theories about his own faith, Obama's visit aimed to repair relations with the Muslim community and counter Islamophobia, though some criticized it as too late. END OF SUMMARY.
