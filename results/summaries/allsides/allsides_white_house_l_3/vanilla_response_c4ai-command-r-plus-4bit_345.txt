SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited the Islamic Society of Baltimore in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He sought to rebut anti-Muslim rhetoric and emphasize the importance of Muslims in the fabric of America. Obama condemned GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims and insisted on applying religious screens that would amplify terrorist messages. He encouraged young Muslim parents to speak out against terror and advocated for the acceptance of people of all faiths in the United States. Obama also cited the history of Islam in America and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. The visit was seen as a public rejection of Islamophobia, but some Muslim-Americans felt it was too late. Obama has previously visited mosques abroad and has worked to repair relations with Muslims worldwide.
END OF SUMMARY.
