SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, seeking to rebut the "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. Obama condemned the GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny and insisted on applying religious screens that would amplify terrorist messages. He advocated against bigotry and stated that America must protect all faiths while also protecting the country from terrorism. Obama listened to the worries of young Muslim parents whose children fear being removed from the country due to their religion. He demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias in the United States. Obama also addressed conspiracy theories about his religious beliefs and reaffirmed his Christian faith. The President encouraged Muslim leaders to continue condemning terrorism and spoke about Islam's long history in America. He called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media and asked for Muslim characters in television shows unrelated to national security. Obama's visit to the mosque was a public rejection of Islamophobia and a show of solidarity with the Muslim community.
END OF SUMMARY.
