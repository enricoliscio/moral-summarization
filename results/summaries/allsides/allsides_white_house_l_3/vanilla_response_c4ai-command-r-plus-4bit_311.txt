SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited the Islamic Society of Baltimore in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He sought to rebut anti-Muslim rhetoric from Republican presidential candidates and encourage members of the Islamic faith to speak out against terror. Obama described Muslims as an essential part of the fabric of America and insisted that religious screening would only amplify terrorist messages. He also demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias into the United States and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in the media. Obama has visited mosques outside the US in the past, but this was his first visit to a mosque in the US, which is home to 2.75 million Muslims. The visit was seen as a public rejection of Islamophobia, but some Muslim-Americans felt it was too late in coming. Obama entered office hoping to repair relations with Muslims abroad and has delivered a speech to global followers of Islam in Cairo.
END OF SUMMARY.
