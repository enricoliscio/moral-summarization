Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Obama visiting a mosque in the US. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. They provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, it's his first visit in the US. He's countering Republican rhetoric against Muslims, especially from candidates like Trump. He's emphasizing that Muslims are part of America and not separate. He's against singling out Muslims for extra scrutiny, saying it amplifies terrorist messages. He also talks about the importance of Muslim leaders condemning terrorism and the need for positive media depictions of Muslims.

I need to make sure I include words like inexcusable, rhetoric, terror, amplify, bigotry, protect, etc. I should structure the summary to highlight Obama's message against bigotry, his support for Muslims being part of America, and his criticism of policies that target Muslims.

I should also mention the context, like the conspiracy theories about him being Muslim and the timing of the visit. Maybe include the reaction from the Muslim community, some saying it's too late.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well while preserving the moral tone.
