SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, to rebuke "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans, particularly from Republican presidential candidates. He emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric, saying "You're Muslim and American." Obama condemned GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, arguing that it would amplify terrorist messages. He also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and advocated for accepting people of all faiths without bias. The President's visit aimed to counter Islamophobia and promote a more inclusive America, where Muslims are not viewed with suspicion. Obama's speech was a forceful counterpoint to rhetoric favored by some Republican candidates, like Donald Trump, who has proposed banning all Muslims from entering the country.
