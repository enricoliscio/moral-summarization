SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in an effort to counter "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans. He emphasized that Muslims are essential to the fabric of America and should not be singled out for extra scrutiny. Obama criticized GOP counterterror plans that would target Muslims, saying it would amplify terrorist groups' messages. He also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and advocated for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. The visit was seen as a response to Republican presidential candidates' anti-Muslim rhetoric, particularly Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US. Many Muslim groups had called for Obama to visit a US mosque to reject Islamophobia, and the event was seen as a significant gesture of inclusion.

END OF SUMMARY.
