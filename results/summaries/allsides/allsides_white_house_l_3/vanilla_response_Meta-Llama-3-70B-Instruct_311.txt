SUMMARY:

President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States. He aimed to counter "inexcusable political rhetoric" against Muslim-Americans from Republican presidential candidates. Obama emphasized that Muslims are an essential part of America's fabric and should not be treated as outsiders. He criticized GOP counterterror plans that single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, saying they would amplify terrorist groups' messages. Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and called for more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. The visit was seen as a rejection of Islamophobia, and many Muslim groups had been calling for him to schedule a stop at a U.S. mosque. However, some Muslim-Americans felt that the visit was too late in coming.
