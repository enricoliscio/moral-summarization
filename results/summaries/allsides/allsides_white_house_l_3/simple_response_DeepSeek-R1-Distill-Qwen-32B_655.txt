Alright, I need to summarize this news article about President Obama's visit to a mosque in the US. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author gave it. So, I should focus on the key points where Obama addresses the issues of Islamophobia, his message to Muslims, and the political context.

First, I'll note that it's his first visit to a US mosque, which is significant. He's countering the negative rhetoric from Republican candidates, especially Trump's proposal to ban Muslims. That's a strong moral stance against discrimination.

He emphasizes that Muslims are an essential part of America, using the phrase "Muslim and American." That's a key moral message about belonging and unity.

He also critiques GOP counterterrorism plans for targeting Muslims, arguing it helps terrorists. That's another moral point about not letting fear dictate policies that harm innocent people.

He mentions conversations with Muslim parents worried about their children, highlighting the emotional impact and the need for acceptance. This adds a personal and empathetic angle to his message.

Obama also calls for positive media portrayals of Muslims, which is about representation and challenging stereotypes. This ties into the broader moral framework of inclusivity and equality.

I should also include that this visit was long-awaited by Muslim groups, showing the significance of the gesture. However, some felt it was too late, indicating ongoing issues despite the visit.

Finally, I'll wrap it up by mentioning his efforts to improve US relations with Muslims globally, showing a consistent moral approach throughout his presidency.

Now, I'll structure the summary to include these points concisely, ensuring it's under 200 words and maintains the moral framing.

Obama emphasized Muslims' integral role in America, stating, "You're Muslim and American," and criticized policies singling out Muslims for surveillance, arguing such measures aid terrorists. He highlighted the emotional toll on Muslim families, particularly children worried about being targeted, and urged acceptance without bias. Obama also called for amplifying Muslim voices against extremism and more positive media portrayals of Muslims. The visit, long advocated by Muslim groups, aimed to reject Islamophobia but was met with mixed reactions, including criticism that it was overdue. Obama's speech underscored his commitment to fostering unity and countering bigotry, aligning with his broader efforts to improve US relations with Muslims globally. END OF SUMMARY.
