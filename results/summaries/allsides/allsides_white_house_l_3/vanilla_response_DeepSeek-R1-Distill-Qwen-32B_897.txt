Okay, I need to summarize this article about President Obama visiting a mosque in the US. Let me read through it carefully.

The article mentions that it's his first visit to a mosque in the US. He's addressing political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans, especially from Republicans. He emphasizes that Muslims are an essential part of America, using strong statements like "you fit right here."

He criticizes GOP counterterror plans that target Muslims, saying it plays into terrorist narratives. He talks about conversations with Muslim parents worried about their kids being deported, which shows the anxiety in the community.

Obama also addresses the stereotype that Muslims aren't patriotic, pointing out that their contributions should be recognized beyond just national security. He mentions the media's role in positive portrayals.

He acknowledges conspiracy theories about him being Muslim, referencing Thomas Jefferson too. The visit was a response to calls from Muslim groups, and while some appreciated it, others felt it was too late.

I should include all these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. Make sure to highlight his main messages: inclusion, criticism of GOP policies, addressing fears, media representation, and the symbolic nature of the visit.
