SUMMARY: President Barack Obama visited a mosque in Baltimore, seeking to rebut the "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He described Muslims as essential to the fabric of America and insisted that they belong in the country just as much as anyone else. Obama advocated against dangerous threads in the political discourse, such as bigotry and Islamophobia. He demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias and expressed heartbreak over the anxieties of young Muslim children who fear being removed from the country. Obama recognized the work of Muslim leaders in condemning terrorism and called for their voices to be amplified. He also encouraged positive depictions of Muslims in the media and acknowledged the long history of Islam in America. The visit was seen as a moral stand against Islamophobia and a message of inclusion and acceptance. However, some Muslim-Americans felt that the visit was too little, too late. Obama's speech aimed to repair relations with Muslims and present a united front against terrorism and bigotry.
