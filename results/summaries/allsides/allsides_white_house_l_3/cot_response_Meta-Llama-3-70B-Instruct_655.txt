SUMMARY:
President Barack Obama visited a mosque in the United States for the first time, seeking to rebut "inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans" from Republican presidential candidates. He described Muslims as essential to the fabric of America, saying "you fit right here" and "you're part of America too." Obama decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, insisting that applying religious screens would only amplify messages coming from terrorist groups. He emphasized that "we can't be bystanders to bigotry" and that America should protect all faiths without bias. Obama also encouraged Muslim leaders to speak out against terror and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. His speech was a forceful counterpoint to the language favored by some Republican presidential candidates, particularly Donald Trump. END OF SUMMARY.
