SUMMARY: On December 22, 2019, Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was assaulted and murdered, suffering head injuries that took her life. In 2017, Ms. Berman had delivered a speech about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. Now, tragically, she has become another victim of the violence that the trans community faces. Ms. Berman's friend, Davina Hader, described her as a lovely person who was committed to political activism and her community, struggling to survive, and asking community members to be more vigilant in the face of targeted violence. This incident is a heartbreaking reminder of the high rates of violence experienced by the trans community, with studies showing that 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and many more harassed or threatened. Despite efforts by organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide education, support, and awareness, trans women like Ms. Berman continue to be vulnerable to fatal attacks. The murder has shocked and saddened those who knew her and underscores the ongoing struggle for safety and inclusion within the LGBTQ2+ community.

END OF SUMMARY.
