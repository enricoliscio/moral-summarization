SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Just two years prior, she delivered a speech at a trans day of remembrance event, speaking out against transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. Tragically, she became a victim of the same violence she was fighting against. Her friend and fellow activist, Davina Hader, described the incident as "heartbreaking" and "very emotional." The study by Trans PULSE project revealed that trans people are targets of specifically directed violence, with 20% physically or sexually assaulted and 34% verbally threatened or harassed. The incident is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences, and the need for greater vigilance and support. As Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, noted, "For many in the trans community, sadly, violence is a part of life." The community mourns the loss of Julie Berman, a lovely person committed to fighting for her community's rights.
