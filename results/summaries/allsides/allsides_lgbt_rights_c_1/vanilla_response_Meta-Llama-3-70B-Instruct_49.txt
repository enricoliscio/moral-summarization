SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Two years prior, she delivered a speech at a trans day of remembrance event, speaking about transphobia in Toronto and the murder of a trans friend. Tragically, she became a victim of the same violence she was fighting against. Police found Berman with head injuries in a Toronto residence and she was pronounced dead at the hospital. A 29-year-old man, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder. Berman was a long-time activist and hairdresser who worked with The 519, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ communities. Her murder is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence faced by the trans community, with studies showing that 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans. The incident has sparked outrage and sadness among the LGBTQ community, with many calling for greater support and action to address the violence.
