SUMMARY: Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, a little over two years after delivering a speech about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. Berman's death highlights the ongoing issue of violence against the trans community, with studies indicating that trans people are targets of specifically directed violence and often feel unsafe. In the past few years, there have been several violent deaths within Toronto's trans community, including that of Alloura Wells, whose case was handled poorly by authorities. Despite efforts by organizations like Pride Toronto and The 519 to provide support and raise awareness, many within the trans community still feel vulnerable and at risk. Berman's death serves as a tragic reminder of the persistent violence and discrimination faced by trans individuals. She was remembered as a lovely person committed to political issues facing her community.
END OF SUMMARY.
