Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is about Julie Berman, a trans rights activist in Toronto, who was murdered. She had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017 about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Two years later, she was killed, which is heartbreaking because she was advocating against the very issues she faced. The police have charged someone with her murder, and he's not part of the LGBTQ community. 

The article also mentions a study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario, with many not reporting assaults. It highlights the ongoing issues of violence and vulnerability in the trans community, with organizations trying to provide support but not enough. The murder is seen as an alarming incident reminding everyone of the high violence rates.

Now, I need to create a summary using as many of the morally framed words as possible. The words include things like murdered, transphobia, assaulted, heartbreaking, etc. I should ensure the summary captures the tragedy, the activism, the statistics, and the community's response.

I'll start by mentioning Julie's murder and her activism. Then, I'll note the study about violence rates. I'll mention the support efforts but also the ongoing vulnerability. Finally, I'll highlight the impact of her death on the community.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all key points with the moral language.

SUMMARY:  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, after being assaulted. Two years earlier, she had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event about transphobia and the murder of a friend, only for the same fate to befall her. Her friend, Davina Hader, described the incident as "heartbreaking," noting that Berman had warned her community to stay vigilant. Berman, a long-time advocate and hairdresser, had been struggling to survive while advocating for her community. Toronto police charged Colin Harnack with her murder; he is not a known member of the LGBTQ community. A 2015 study revealed that 20% of Ontario’s trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted due to their identity, with 34% facing verbal threats or harassment. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, stated that violence is a frequent reality for trans individuals, particularly women. Since 2017, Toronto has seen three violent deaths in its trans community, highlighting the ongoing vulnerability of trans people despite support programs and events aimed at raising awareness. Berman’s death is seen as an alarming reminder of the high rates of violence against the trans community. END OF SUMMARY.
