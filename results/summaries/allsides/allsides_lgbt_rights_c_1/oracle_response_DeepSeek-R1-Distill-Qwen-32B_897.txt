Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. The article is about Julie Berman, a trans rights activist who was murdered, and the context of violence against the trans community in Toronto.

First, I'll start by identifying the key points: Julie's activism, her murder, the connection to her speech, the police response, the study on violence, and the community's efforts to support each other. I need to include words like "murdered," "transphobia," "assaulted," "heartbreaking," "activism," etc.

I should structure the summary to flow from Julie's background, her murder, the context of violence, and the community's response. I'll make sure to mention the study and the statistics to highlight the ongoing issues. Also, including quotes from her friends and the executive director adds emotional weight.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. Let me check the word count as I draft. I'll start with Julie's death, her activism, the emotional impact, the suspect, the study, and the community's efforts. I'll ensure that the moral terms are included without making it sound forced.

Now, putting it all together, making sure each sentence includes relevant moral framing words and flows logically. I'll avoid adding new information not in the article and stick to the key points. Let me read through the summary to ensure it meets all requirements and preserves the moral tone.

SUMMARY:  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, in an incident that deeply affected her community. Two years prior, at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, she had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a friend, only for the same fate to befall her. Davina Hader, a friend and member of The 519, described the tragedy as "heartbreaking," noting that Berman had struggled to survive and was vocal about the need for vigilance in her community. Police charged Colin Harnack, 29, with second-degree murder, though he is not known to be part of the LGBTQ community. Berman, a hairdresser and longtime community advocate, had been involved in activism for nearly three decades.  

A 2015 study highlighted that 20% of Ontario’s trans population had been physically or sexually assaulted due to their identity, with 34% facing verbal threats or harassment. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasized that violence remains a part of life for many trans individuals, citing three violent deaths in Toronto’s trans community in recent years. The murder of Berman, who was committed to addressing these issues, is seen as an alarming reminder of the ongoing threats faced by trans people. Community organizations have organized events and workshops to provide support, though gaps in resources leave many vulnerable. Berman’s death underscores the need for continued activism and awareness. END OF SUMMARY.
