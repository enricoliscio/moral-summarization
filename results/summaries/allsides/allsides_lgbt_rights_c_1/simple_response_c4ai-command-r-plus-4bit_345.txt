SUMMARY: On December 22, 2019, Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was assaulted and murdered, a tragic loss for the LGBTQ community. Berman, who had been a hairdresser and community advocate for nearly three decades, was a vocal critic of transphobia and had herself spoken out against the murder of a trans friend at a vigil in 2017. Her death is a stark reminder of the persistent violence and vulnerability faced by trans individuals, with studies indicating that 20% of Ontario's trans people have experienced physical or sexual assault due to their identity. This is compounded by a lack of trust in police, with 24% reporting harassment by law enforcement. Berman's death follows a string of violent fatalities within Toronto's trans community, highlighting the urgent need for greater awareness, education, and support to address the pervasive issues of transphobia and violence. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasizes the alarming nature of the incident and the ongoing struggle for safety within the trans community. Berman's legacy as a committed and beloved advocate will be deeply missed. 

END OF SUMMARY.
