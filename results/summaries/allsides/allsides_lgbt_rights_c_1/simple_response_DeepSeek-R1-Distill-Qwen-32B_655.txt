Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Julie Berman was a trans rights activist who was murdered, and the article talks about her activism and the context of violence against the trans community in Toronto.

I should start by identifying the key elements: who Julie Berman was, her activism, the circumstances of her death, the emotional impact on her community, and the broader issues of violence against trans people. The moral framing here is about the systemic violence and lack of safety for trans individuals, especially women.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the emotional response from her friends and community members, the statistics about violence, and the efforts being made to support the community despite ongoing issues. Also, mentioning that the suspect isn't part of the LGBTQ community adds to the moral aspect of external violence against the group.

I'll structure the summary to first introduce Julie and her murder, then her activism, the community's reaction, the statistics, and the ongoing challenges. Keeping it concise but comprehensive, making sure it's under 200 words. I'll avoid including too many details about specific events unless they're crucial to the moral message.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary ends with the impact of her death and the community's efforts to address these issues, emphasizing the need for vigilance and support. That should capture the moral framing effectively.

SUMMARY:  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, in an attack that deeply affected her community. At a 2017 Trans Day of Remembrance event, Berman had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend, only for a similar fate to befall her two years later. Toronto police arrested Colin Harnack, 29, for her murder, noting he is not part of the LGBTQ community. Berman, a long-time community advocate, had urged her peers to remain vigilant, a call that now feels tragically prescient.  

Her death highlights the ongoing violence faced by trans individuals, particularly women. A 2015 study found 20% of Ontario’s trans population had experienced physical or sexual assault due to their identity, with 34% facing verbal harassment. Many incidents go unreported, often due to mistrust in law enforcement.  

Berman’s murder follows a pattern of violence in Toronto’s trans community, with at least three such deaths in recent years. Her activism and involvement with The 519, an LGBTQ advocacy group, underscored her commitment to fighting for her community’s safety. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasized the systemic vulnerability faced by trans individuals, despite efforts to raise awareness and support through events and programs.  

Berman’s death serves as a stark reminder of the challenges trans people continue to face, even in ostensibly progressive cities like Toronto. Her legacy as a dedicated activist will be deeply missed.
