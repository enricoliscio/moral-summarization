Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Julie Berman was a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered. She had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Two years later, she was killed, which is heartbreaking. The police charged someone with her murder. The article also mentions that trans people in Toronto face high rates of violence, and many don't feel safe. There have been several violent deaths in the community recently. Organizations are trying to support them, but it's still a struggle.

I need to highlight the moral issues here: the murder, the transphobia, the struggle for safety, the support efforts, and the ongoing violence. I should use words like "murdered," "transphobia," "assaulted," "heartbreaking," "violence," "vulnerable," "support," etc.

I'll start by introducing Julie Berman and her murder. Then mention her activism and the emotional impact. Include the statistics about violence against trans people and the community's efforts to support each other. Conclude with the reminder of the ongoing issues.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each moral point is covered concisely.

SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019. Two years earlier, at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, she had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. Her death is heartbreaking, as it mirrors the violence she had sought to address through her activism. Toronto police charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. Berman, a long-time community advocate, had struggled to survive and was deeply involved in supporting the LGBTQ+ community. Her murder highlights the ongoing violence and vulnerability faced by trans individuals, particularly in Toronto, where three violent deaths have occurred in recent years. A 2015 study revealed that 20% of Ontario’s trans people had experienced physical or sexual assault due to their identity, with many not reporting such assaults. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and education, the community remains vulnerable. Berman’s death serves as an alarming reminder of the high rates of violence against trans people, emphasizing the need for continued advocacy and support. END OF SUMMARY.
