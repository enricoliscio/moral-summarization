SUMMARY: On December 22, 2019, Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered, suffering head injuries in a tragic incident. Berman had been vocal about transphobia and violence against the trans community, and her death is a heartbreaking reminder of the struggles faced by trans people. Berman had previously spoken about the murder of a trans friend and the prevalence of transphobia in Toronto. Her activism shed light on the vulnerability and lack of safety experienced by trans women, with studies indicating that 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans. The high rates of violence and harassment within the trans community are alarming, and despite efforts by organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide support and education, more needs to be done to protect trans individuals. Berman's death is a tragic loss, and her activism and commitment to her community will be sorely missed. This incident underscores the urgent need to address the pervasive violence and discrimination faced by the trans community.
