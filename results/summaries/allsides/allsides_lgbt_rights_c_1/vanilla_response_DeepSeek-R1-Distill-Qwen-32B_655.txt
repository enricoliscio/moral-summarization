Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman. Let me read through it carefully. The article starts by stating that Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. She was speaking at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017, talking about transphobia and a friend who was murdered. It's really sad that the same thing happened to her. Her friend, Davina Hader, mentions that Julie didn't want a video from the event released, but now they're considering it. The police found her with head injuries and charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. He's not part of the LGBTQ community. Julie was involved with The 519 for almost 30 years, helping the community. The article also mentions a study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario, and that many don't report it. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto says violence is part of life for many trans people. There have been three violent deaths in Toronto's trans community recently. The article also touches on how organizations are trying to support the community but it's still not enough. The Trans March in Toronto is one of the largest, showing community strength and awareness. Julie's murder is a reminder of the ongoing issues. She was committed to her community and will be missed.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: Julie's murder, her activism, the context from her 2017 speech, the police's action, the study about trans violence, the community's response, and her impact. I need to make sure it's concise but covers all important aspects without getting too detailed. Let me structure it step by step, starting with her death, her activism, the emotional context, the suspect, the study, community efforts, and her legacy.
