SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019. Two years prior, she spoke at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, highlighting transphobia in Toronto and the murder of a trans friend. Her speech was filmed, but she asked her friend not to release the clip online. Berman was found with head injuries in a Toronto residence and was pronounced dead at the hospital. A 29-year-old man, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder. Berman's activism aimed to raise awareness about violence against trans people, a community that faces high rates of violence, with 20% physically or sexually assaulted and 34% verbally threatened or harassed. The incident is a reminder of the need for greater support and education for the trans community.
