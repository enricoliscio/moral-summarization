Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman's murder. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by stating that Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. She had given a speech at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017, talking about transphobia and a friend who was murdered. Now, two years later, she herself was killed. Her friend Davina Hader mentions how heartbreaking it is that the same issue she spoke about happened to her. 

Julie was found with head injuries in her residence, and Colin Harnack was charged with her murder. Harnack isn't part of the LGBTQ community. Julie was involved with The 519 for almost three decades, helping the community, and she struggled to survive. 

The article also mentions a study from 2015 showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario, with many not reporting assaults. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto notes that violence is a part of life for many trans individuals. There have been three violent deaths in Toronto's trans community recently, including Alloura Wells, whose case was mishandled by authorities. 

Efforts have been made to support the trans community, but resources are still lacking, leaving many vulnerable. The trans march during Toronto Pride is one of the largest, showing community strength and awareness. Julie was committed to her community's issues and will be missed.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on Julie's activism, her murder, the context of transphobia, the study's findings, and the community's response. I should mention the impact of her death and the ongoing challenges faced by the trans community.
