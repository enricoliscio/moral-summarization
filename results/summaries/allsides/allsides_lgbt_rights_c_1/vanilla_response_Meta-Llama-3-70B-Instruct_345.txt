SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Two years prior, she spoke at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, highlighting the transphobia in Toronto and the murder of a trans friend. Sadly, she became a victim of the same violence she was fighting against. Police found her with head injuries in a Toronto residence and pronounced her dead at the hospital. A 29-year-old man, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder. Berman was a vocal advocate for the trans community, urging members to be vigilant and aware of the violence they face. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. The trans community has faced multiple violent deaths in recent years, highlighting the need for increased support and education.
