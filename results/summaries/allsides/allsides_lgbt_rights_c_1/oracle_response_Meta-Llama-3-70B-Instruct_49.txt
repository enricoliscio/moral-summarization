SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and suffering head injuries. This heartbreaking incident is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Berman was a vocal advocate against transphobia, having spoken at a trans day of remembrance event in 2017 about the murder of a trans friend. Her activism was driven by a desire to raise awareness and support for her community. Tragically, she became a target of the very violence she was fighting against. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. Many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% have been harassed by police. The incident is an alarming reminder of the need for greater support and awareness for the trans community, who often struggle to survive and feel vulnerable. END OF SUMMARY.
