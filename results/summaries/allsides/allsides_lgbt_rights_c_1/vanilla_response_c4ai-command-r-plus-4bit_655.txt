SUMMARY: Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, a little over two years after giving a speech about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. Berman's death highlights the issue of violence against trans people, with studies indicating that a significant proportion of trans individuals face physical and sexual assault, verbal threats, and harassment. Berman's friends and members of the LGBTQ community are mourning her death and calling for more support and protection for trans individuals. They note that despite efforts by organizations like Pride Toronto and The 519 to provide education and support, trans people continue to face high rates of violence and vulnerability.
