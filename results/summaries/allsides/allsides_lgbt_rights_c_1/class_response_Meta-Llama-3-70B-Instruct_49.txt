SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and suffering from head injuries. This heartbreaking incident is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Berman had been vocal about transphobia in Toronto, speaking about a friend who was murdered, and advocating for the inclusion of LGBTQ communities. Her own death is a tragic irony, highlighting the struggles and vulnerabilities faced by trans individuals. A study revealed that 20% of Ontario's trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% had been verbally threatened or harassed. Many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% reported being harassed by police. The incident is an alarming reminder of the need for increased support and education for the trans community. Berman's activism and legacy will be well missed. END OF SUMMARY.
