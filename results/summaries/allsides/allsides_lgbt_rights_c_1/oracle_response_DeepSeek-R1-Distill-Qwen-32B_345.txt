Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Julie Berman, a trans rights activist who was murdered. The article talks about her speech at a trans day of remembrance, her friend's murder, and the subsequent charges against Colin Harnack. There's also mention of the high rates of violence against trans people in Toronto, the community's efforts to support each other, and the broader context of transphobia.

I need to make sure I include all the morally charged words the author used. Words like "murdered," "transphobia," "assaulted," "heartbreaking," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I should structure it to highlight Julie's activism, the tragedy of her murder, the statistics on violence, and the community's response.

I'll start by introducing Julie and her murder. Then mention her speech and the friend's murder. Include the police information and the suspect's charges. Then discuss the study on violence against trans people, the community's efforts, and the ongoing issues. Make sure to use as many of the listed moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me check the word count as I go. I need to keep it tight but comprehensive. Maybe start with her death, her activism, the impact on the community, the statistics, and the community's response. That should cover the main points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, in an incident that deeply saddened her community. At a 2017 Trans Day of Remembrance event, she had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend, only for the same violence to be directed at her two years later. Toronto police charged Colin Harnack, 29, with her second-degree murder. Berman, a long-time community member and hairdresser, had dedicated her life to activism, urging vigilance against transphobia and violence. Her death highlights the alarming rates of violence against trans people, as shown by a 2015 study revealing that 20% of Ontario’s trans population had been physically or sexually assaulted due to their identity. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and awareness, many in the trans community remain vulnerable. Berman’s murder serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by trans individuals, emphasizing the need for continued activism and support. END OF SUMMARY.
