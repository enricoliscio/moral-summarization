SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Two years prior, she spoke at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, highlighting the transphobia in Toronto and the murder of a trans friend. Her speech was not released online at her request. Berman was found with head injuries in a Toronto residence and was pronounced dead at the hospital. A 29-year-old man, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder. Berman's death is a devastating blow to the LGBTQ community, which has experienced high rates of violence. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. The community is left vulnerable despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Pride Toronto to provide education, support, and anti-violence programs. Berman's murder is a heartbreaking reminder of the violence faced by the trans community.
