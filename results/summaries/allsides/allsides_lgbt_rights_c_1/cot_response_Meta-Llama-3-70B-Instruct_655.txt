SUMMARY:
Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, in a heartbreaking and alarming incident. Two years prior, she delivered a speech at a trans day of remembrance event, highlighting the transphobia in Toronto and the murder of a trans friend. Her activism emphasized the need for vigilance in the community. Tragically, she became a victim of the same violence she was fighting against. A study revealed that trans people are targets of specifically directed violence, with 20% physically or sexually assaulted and 34% verbally threatened or harassed. Many trans individuals do not report these assaults to the police, citing harassment by authorities. The community is left feeling vulnerable and unsafe. Berman's murder serves as a reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences, and her legacy will be well missed. END OF SUMMARY.
