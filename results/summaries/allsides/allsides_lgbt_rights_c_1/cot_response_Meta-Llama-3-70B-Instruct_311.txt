SUMMARY:
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. This heartbreaking incident is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Berman was a vocal advocate for trans rights, having spoken about transphobia in Toronto at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017. Her murder is an unfortunate and sad irony, as she was trying to raise awareness about the same issue that ultimately took her life. The trans community is often left vulnerable to targeted violence, with many experiencing harassment and assault. According to a study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. Berman's murder is an alarming incident that highlights the need for greater vigilance and support for the trans community. END OF SUMMARY.
