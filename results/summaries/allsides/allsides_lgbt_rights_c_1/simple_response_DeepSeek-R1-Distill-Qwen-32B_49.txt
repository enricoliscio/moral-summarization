Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman's murder, preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

Julie was a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered in December 2019. She had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017 about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Now, the same fate happened to her. Her friend Davina Hader mentions how tragic it is that the violence she spoke against happened to her. The police found her with head injuries and charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. Harnack isn't part of the LGBTQ community.

The article also mentions a study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto notes that violence is common in the trans community, citing other murders in Toronto. The community is trying to support each other but resources are limited, leaving many vulnerable.

I need to capture the moral issues: the tragedy of her death, the ongoing violence against the trans community, the lack of safety, and the efforts to support despite limited resources. Also, highlight her activism and the impact of her death as a call to action.

Let me structure the summary: Start with her death, her activism, the context of violence, the study, community efforts, and the call to action. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and include key points like the study, other murders, community support, and the moral implications.

Make sure to mention that the murderer isn't LGBTQ, the study's stats, and the ongoing issues despite community efforts. End with the call for vigilance and support.

SUMMARY:  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, just over two years after she delivered a heartfelt speech at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017, where she spoke about transphobia and the murder of a close friend. Her friend, Davina Hader, described the tragedy as heartbreaking, noting that the violence Julie had campaigned against had now claimed her life. Julie was found with head injuries and pronounced dead; Colin Harnack, a non-LGBTQ community member, was charged with her murder.  

Julie’s activism focused on raising awareness about the dangers faced by trans individuals, a community disproportionately targeted by violence. A 2015 study revealed that 20% of Ontario’s trans population had experienced physical or sexual assault, while 34% faced verbal harassment. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Pride Toronto to support the community, many remain vulnerable due to limited resources and past failures in handling cases like that of Alloura Wells, another trans woman murdered in Toronto.  

Olivia Nuamah of Pride Toronto emphasized that violence against trans people is alarmingly common, calling Julie’s death a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle for safety and inclusion. Julie’s murder highlights the need for continued vigilance and support for the trans community, as they fight for recognition and protection in a society that often fails them.  
END OF SUMMARY.
