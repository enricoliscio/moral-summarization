SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Two years prior, at a trans day of remembrance event, Ms. Berman gave a speech about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. Ms. Berman's death is a tragic reminder of the violence that the trans community continues to face. According to a 2015 study by the Trans PULSE project, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and many trans people do not report these assaults to the police. The study also found that 24% of trans people have been harassed by police. In the past few years, there have been several violent deaths within Toronto's trans community, including the death of Alloura Wells in 2017. Since then, organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 have organized events and workshops to provide education and support for the trans community. However, these efforts are still not enough to protect trans individuals from violence and vulnerability. The murder of Ms. Berman has once again brought attention to the alarming rates of violence experienced by the trans community.
END OF SUMMARY.
