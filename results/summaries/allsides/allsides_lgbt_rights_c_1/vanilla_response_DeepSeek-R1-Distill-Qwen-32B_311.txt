Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by saying Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019. She had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017 about transphobia and a friend who was murdered. Now, two years later, she was killed. Her friend, Davina Hader, talks about how heartbreaking it is that the same thing happened to her. The police found her with head injuries and she died. Colin Harnack was charged with second-degree murder. He's not part of the LGBTQ community.

Julie was involved with The 519 for almost 30 years, helping the community. She was a hairdresser. The article mentions a study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto says violence is part of life for many trans people. There have been three violent deaths in Toronto's trans community recently. The article also mentions Alloura Wells, another trans woman who was murdered and whose case was mishandled by authorities.

Since then, organizations have been trying to support the trans community, but resources are still lacking. The trans march in Toronto is one of the largest, showing community strength and awareness. Julie was committed to her community, and her death is a reminder of the ongoing issues.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the key points: her death, her activism, the context of transphobia, the study's statistics, the impact on the community, and the efforts to support them. Make sure to mention her friend's reaction and the suspect. Also, highlight the broader issue of violence against trans people and the community's response.

Let me structure it step by step: introduce Julie, her death, her activism, the emotional impact, the study, the broader context of violence, the community's efforts, and conclude with her legacy.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll focus on the most important details without getting too bogged down in specifics. Make sure the summary flows well and covers all necessary points without exceeding the word limit.
