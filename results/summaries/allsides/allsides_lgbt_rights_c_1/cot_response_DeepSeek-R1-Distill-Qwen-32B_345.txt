Okay, so I need to help the user summarize this news article about Julie Berman. They mentioned that I should act as a news summarizer assistant and a moral expert, preserving the moral framing. 

First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the key points. Julie Berman was a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered. The article talks about her activism, her speech at a trans day of remembrance event, and the impact of her death on the community. It also mentions the statistics about violence against trans people and the efforts to support the community.

Now, the user has given specific instructions. They want me to first identify all the single words that are morally framed. I need to look for words that carry moral weight, like "murdered," "transphobia," "assaulted," "victimized," etc. I'll list each of these words, each on a new line starting with an asterisk.

After that, I need to write a concise summary of the article, making sure to include as many of these morally framed words as possible. The summary should be no longer than 200 words and should end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should ensure that the summary captures the essence of Julie's activism, her murder, the community's reaction, the statistics on violence, and the ongoing efforts to support the trans community. It's important to highlight the moral issues and the community's resilience.

I need to be careful not to add any new information beyond what's in the article. The summary should flow naturally, preserving the moral framing while being concise. I'll structure it by starting with Julie's murder, her activism, the community's response, the statistics, and the ongoing efforts.

Let me make sure I don't miss any key points. Julie was a well-known activist, her murder is tragic, the community is heartbroken, there's a history of violence, and efforts are being made to support the community despite the challenges. I'll incorporate all these elements into the summary.

I think I have a good grasp on this. Time to put it all together, first listing the morally framed words and then the summary.

**SUMMARY:**  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019. Two years earlier, at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, she had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Her friend, Davina Hader, recalled how Julie’s activism focused on vigilance within the community. Julie’s murder, committed by Colin Harnack, a non-LGBTQ community member, highlights the ongoing violence faced by trans individuals. A 2015 study revealed that 20% of Ontario’s trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, with 34% verbally threatened or harassed. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, noted that violence is a tragic reality for many trans individuals. Since 2017, Toronto’s trans community has experienced three violent deaths, including Julie’s. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and education, many remain vulnerable. Julie’s death serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by the trans community, emphasizing the need for continued advocacy and awareness. END OF SUMMARY.
