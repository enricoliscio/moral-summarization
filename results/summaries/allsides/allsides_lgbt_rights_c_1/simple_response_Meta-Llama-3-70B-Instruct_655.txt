SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019, in a tragic irony. Just two years prior, she had spoken at a trans day of remembrance event about transphobia in Toronto, sharing the story of a trans friend who was murdered. Her own murder serves as a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and discrimination that trans individuals face. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. Many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% have been harassed by police. The trans community is left vulnerable, and the murder of Julie Berman is an alarming incident that highlights the need for greater awareness and support.
