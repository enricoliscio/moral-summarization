SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and suffering from head injuries. This heartbreaking incident is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Berman was a vocal advocate against transphobia, having spoken about the murder of a trans friend at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017. Her death is a tragic irony, as she was struggling to survive and fighting for her community's rights. According to a 2015 study, trans people are targets of specifically directed violence, with 20% having been physically or sexually assaulted and 34% verbally threatened or harassed. The incident is an alarming reminder of the need for support and education for the trans community, which is often left vulnerable. Berman's activism and commitment to her community will be well missed. Her death is a sad and unfortunate incident that highlights the need for a more welcoming and inclusive society.
