SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Two years prior, she delivered a speech at a trans day of remembrance event, speaking out against transphobia and violence against the trans community. Tragically, she became a victim of the same violence she was fighting against. Police found Berman with head injuries in a Toronto residence and pronounced her dead at the hospital. A 29-year-old man, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder. Berman was a dedicated activist who worked with The 519, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ communities. Her death is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence against the trans community, with studies showing that 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. The incident has left the community heartbroken and highlights the need for greater support and awareness.
