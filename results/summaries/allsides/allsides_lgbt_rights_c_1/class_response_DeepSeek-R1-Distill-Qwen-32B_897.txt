Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided the article and the list of morally framed words. I should make sure to include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long, just under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Julie Berman was a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered. She spoke at a Trans Day of Remembrance event about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Two years later, she was killed. The police arrested someone for her murder. The article also mentions the high rates of violence against trans people, with a study showing 20% physically assaulted and 34% verbally harassed. It talks about the community's efforts to support each other and the challenges they face.

I need to include the morally charged words like "murdered," "transphobia," "assaulted," "heartbreaking," etc. I should structure the summary to cover Julie's activism, her murder, the context of violence against trans people, and the community's response.

I'll start by stating Julie's murder, her activism, and the emotional impact. Then mention the study on violence, the community's efforts, and the call for vigilance. I'll make sure to use the moral words to convey the gravity of the situation.

I should also keep the summary concise, so I'll focus on the key points without getting too detailed. Maybe mention the statistics briefly and the community's support programs. I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all the important aspects while staying within the word limit.

Let me draft a version and check the word count. I'll make sure to include all the necessary moral terms and present the information clearly. If it's too long, I'll trim it down, perhaps combining sentences or removing less critical details.

After drafting, I'll review to ensure all the moral framing words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and tone.

SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019. Two years earlier, at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, she had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a friend, only for the same violence to be directed at her. Her friend Davina Hader described the tragedy as "heartbreaking," noting that Berman had warned her community about such dangers. Berman, a long-time activist and hairdresser, had been advocating for vigilance and inclusion. Toronto police charged Colin Harnack with her murder, though he is not known to be part of the LGBTQ community. A 2015 study revealed that 20% of Ontario’s trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% verbally threatened or harassed. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and education, many trans individuals remain vulnerable. Berman’s death is a stark reminder of the ongoing violence faced by the trans community, highlighting the need for continued activism and support. END OF SUMMARY.
