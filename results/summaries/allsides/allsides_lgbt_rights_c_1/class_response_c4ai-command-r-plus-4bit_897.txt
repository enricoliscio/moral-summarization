SUMMARY: On December 22, 2019, Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered, suffering head injuries in a tragic incident. Two years prior, Berman had spoken out against transphobia and violence in her community, recounting the murder of a trans friend. Now, Berman has become another tragic fatality of the violence she fought against.

Berman's friend, Davina Hader, described the murder as "heartbreaking," highlighting the irony of Berman becoming a victim of the very issues she tried to address through her activism. Hader also noted that Berman had been struggling to survive and that her death was a devastating loss for the community.

According to a study by the Trans PULSE project, trans people in Ontario are targets of violence, with 20% having been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans. The study also revealed that many trans individuals do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% have experienced harassment by law enforcement.

Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, acknowledged the alarming rates of violence within the trans community and expressed concern for the safety of trans women. She highlighted the recent violent deaths within Toronto's trans community and the efforts of organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide support and education.

The murder of Julie Berman serves as a somber reminder of the ongoing struggle for safety and acceptance faced by the trans community. Her death is a tragic loss for those who knew her and a call to action for greater protection and support for vulnerable members of the LGBTQ2+ community.
