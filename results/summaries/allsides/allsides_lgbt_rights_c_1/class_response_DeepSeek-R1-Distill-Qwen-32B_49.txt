Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first.

Julie Berman was a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered. She spoke at a 2017 event about transphobia and a friend's murder. Two years later, she was killed. Her friend Davina Hader mentions the emotional impact and that Julie didn't want her speech released. Police found her with head injuries and charged Colin Harnack with murder. He's not part of the LGBTQ community.

Julie was involved with The 519 for decades, struggling to survive. The article mentions a 2015 study showing high rates of violence against trans people, with many not reporting. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto notes that violence is common, and Toronto has had three trans deaths recently. The city's response includes support programs but they're insufficient, leaving the community vulnerable.

The summary needs to include as many of the morally framed words as possible. I'll focus on the key points: Julie's activism, her murder, the emotional impact, the study on violence, the community's vulnerability, and the support efforts.

I should structure it to highlight the moral issues: the murder, the context of transphobia, the struggle, the support, and the ongoing issues. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the specified terms.

SUMMARY:  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, in an incident that deeply saddened her community. At a 2017 Trans Day of Remembrance event, she had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend, only for the same fate to befall her two years later. Davina Hader, a friend and member of The 519, described the tragedy as heartbreaking, noting that Julie had struggled to survive and was committed to advocating for her community. Toronto police charged Colin Harnack with her murder, though he is not known to be part of the LGBTQ community.  

A 2015 study highlighted the high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario, with 20% experiencing physical or sexual assault and 34% facing verbal harassment. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasized that violence is a tragic reality for many in the trans community, particularly vulnerable individuals like Julie. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and education, resources remain insufficient, leaving many trans individuals at risk. Julieâ€™s death serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by the trans community.
