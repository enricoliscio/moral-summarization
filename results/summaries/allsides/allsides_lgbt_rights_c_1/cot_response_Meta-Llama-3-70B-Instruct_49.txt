SUMMARY:
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. In a heartbreaking irony, she was vocal about transphobia in Toronto, having spoken about a trans friend who was murdered at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017. Her activism urged her community to be more vigilant, but tragically, she became a victim of the same violence she fought against. The trans community is particularly vulnerable, with a study showing that 20% of Ontario's trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% had been verbally threatened or harassed. The murder is an alarming incident that highlights the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Berman's death is a sad reminder of the unfortunate reality that many trans people face.
