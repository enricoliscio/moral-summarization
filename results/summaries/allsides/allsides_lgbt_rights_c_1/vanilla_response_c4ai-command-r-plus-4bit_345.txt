SUMMARY: Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, a little over two years after she gave a speech at a trans day of remembrance event, calling for an end to transphobia and violence against trans people. Ms. Berman's death is a tragic reminder of the persistent violence and discrimination faced by the trans community. In her speech, Ms. Berman spoke about the murder of a trans friend and advocated for greater vigilance in addressing transphobia. Despite her efforts and those of other activists, trans people continue to be targets of violence and harassment, as highlighted by a 2015 study which found that 20% of Ontario's trans individuals had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans. The study also noted that many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, with 24% reporting harassment by law enforcement. The executive director of Pride Toronto, Olivia Nuamah, emphasized the alarming nature of Ms. Berman's murder and the need to address the high rates of violence within the trans community. Ms. Berman's death follows a string of violent incidents against trans individuals in Toronto, including the death of Alloura Wells in 2017, highlighting the ongoing challenges in creating a safe and inclusive environment for the trans community.
