Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman. Let me read through it carefully. 

The article starts by stating that Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019. She had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017 about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Now, two years later, she was killed. Her friend, Davina Hader, mentions how heartbreaking it is that the same thing happened to her. 

The police found her with head injuries and charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. He's not part of the LGBTQ community. Julie was involved with The 519 for almost three decades, working as a hairdresser and advocating for vigilance in her community. 

A 2015 study shows that 20% of Ontario trans people were physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% were verbally harassed. Many didn't report these incidents. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto mentions that violence is part of life for many trans people. In Toronto, there have been three violent deaths in recent years, including Julie and Alloura Wells. 

The organizations have been working to support the community, but resources are insufficient, leaving many vulnerable. The trans march in Toronto is one of the largest, showing community strength and awareness. Nuamah sees Julie's murder as a wake-up call about the violence faced by trans people. Julie was committed to her community and will be missed.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the key points: Julie's activism, her murder, the police charges, the study's statistics, the community's vulnerability, and the efforts to support them. Also, mention the impact of her death and the ongoing issues faced by the trans community.

Let me structure this clearly, making sure each important detail is included without exceeding the word limit. I'll start with her death, her activism, the friend's reaction, the police info, the study's findings, the community's struggles, and the organizations' efforts. End with her legacy and the call to action.
