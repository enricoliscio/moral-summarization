SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019, in a tragic act of transphobic violence. Two years prior, Ms. Berman had spoken at a vigil about the murder of a trans friend, and the persistent threat of violence that the trans community faces. Sadly, Ms. Berman herself became a victim of this violence.

Ms. Berman's friend, Davina Hader, recalled her activism and commitment to her community. She had been involved with The 519, an organization advocating for LGBTQ inclusion, for almost three decades. Ms. Hader also noted that Ms. Berman had asked her not to release a video of her speech from the 2017 vigil, a request that she had respected until now.

The murder of Ms. Berman is a stark reminder of the dangerous reality for trans individuals in Toronto and beyond. A 2015 study by the Trans PULSE project found that 20% of Ontario's trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, with an additional 34% verbally threatened or harassed.

Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, stated that trans women often do not feel safe, and that violence is a sad part of life for many in the trans community. She also highlighted the efforts of organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide education, support, and advocacy for trans individuals, but acknowledged that these efforts are not enough to protect everyone.

The tragic death of Julie Berman underscores the urgent need for greater awareness, support, and protection for the trans community in Toronto and beyond. Her activism and commitment to her community will be sorely missed.
