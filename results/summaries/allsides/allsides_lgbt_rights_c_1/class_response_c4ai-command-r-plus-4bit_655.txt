SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019, in a tragic and heartbreaking incident. Two years prior, Ms. Berman had spoken out against transphobia and violence in her community, and the murder of a trans friend. Sadly, she herself became a victim of the very violence she had tried to bring awareness to. Ms. Berman was assaulted and suffered head injuries that led to her death. Colin Harnack, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder.

Ms. Berman's death shines a light on the alarming rates of violence experienced by the trans community. A 2015 study found that 20% of Ontario's trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and many more had been verbally threatened or harassed. Trans women, in particular, face an increased risk of becoming victims of violence.

The trans community in Toronto has been deeply affected by recent violent deaths, including that of Alloura Wells in 2017. Despite efforts by organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide support and education, many within the trans community still feel vulnerable and unsafe. The murder of Julie Berman is a somber reminder of the ongoing struggle for safety and acceptance faced by the trans community. Her activism and commitment to political issues will be greatly missed.
END OF SUMMARY.
