SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and suffering from head injuries. This heartbreaking incident is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Berman was a vocal advocate against transphobia, having spoken about the murder of a trans friend at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017. Her activism was a call to action for her community to be more vigilant, as trans people are often targets of specifically directed violence. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and 34% had been verbally threatened or harassed. The incident is a tragic reminder that many trans people do not feel safe, and that violence is a part of life for many in the trans community. Berman's death is the third violent death in Toronto's trans community in recent years, highlighting the need for greater support and awareness.
