Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about Julie Berman's murder and the context of violence against the trans community. 

First, I should identify all the morally framed words. Looking through the article, words like "murdered," "transphobia," "assaulted," "victimized," "sad," "unfortunate," "vulnerable," "oppressed," "discriminated," "harassed," "violence," "inequality," "struggled," "fear," "suffering," "injustices," "challenges," and "prejudice" stand out as they carry moral connotations.

Next, I need to write a concise summary. I should include the key points: Julie's activism, her murder, the context of violence against trans people, the statistics from the study, the community's response, and the call for vigilance and support. I must ensure that the summary stays under 200 words and retains the moral framing by using the identified words.

I'll structure the summary to highlight Julie's advocacy, the impact of her death, the statistics on violence, the community's efforts, and the ongoing issues faced by the trans community. I'll make sure to mention the study's findings and the lack of reporting by victims, emphasizing the systemic issues and the need for more support.

I need to be careful to preserve the moral tone, so I'll use words like "tragedy," "victimized," "sad," "unfortunate," and "vulnerable" to convey the gravity of the situation. I'll also mention the community's efforts to raise awareness and support, showing their resilience despite the challenges.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with Julie's background, moving to her murder, the context of violence, community responses, and the broader implications. I'll end by noting the need for continued vigilance and support, reinforcing the moral imperative to address these issues.

**SUMMARY:**  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, after being assaulted. Two years earlier, she had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event about transphobia and the murder of a friend, only for the same fate to befall her. Her friend, Davina Hader, noted the heartbreaking irony of her death, as Julie had warned her community about such violence. Toronto police arrested Colin Harnack, a non-LGBTQ community member, for her murder. Julie, a long-time advocate, had urged vigilance in the face of transphobic violence. A 2015 study revealed that 20% of Ontario’s trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, with 34% experiencing verbal harassment. Many victims did not report these crimes, and 24% reported being harassed by police. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasized that violence against trans people, particularly trans women, is alarmingly common. Since 2017, Toronto’s trans community has experienced three violent deaths, highlighting the ongoing risks faced by its members. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and education, many trans individuals remain vulnerable. Julie’s death serves as a tragic reminder of the systemic violence and inequality trans people face, and her legacy calls for continued vigilance and support for the community. END OF SUMMARY.
