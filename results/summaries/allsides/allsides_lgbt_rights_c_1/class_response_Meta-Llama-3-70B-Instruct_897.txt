SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was brutally murdered on December 22, 2019, in a heartbreaking incident that highlights the alarming rates of violence against the trans community. Berman had spoken out against transphobia at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017, where she shared the story of a trans friend who was murdered. Her own murder is a tragic reminder of the struggles and dangers faced by trans individuals. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. Many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% have reported being harassed by police. Berman's murder is the third violent death in Toronto's trans community in recent years, underscoring the need for greater support and protection for vulnerable trans individuals. The incident is a sobering reminder of the importance of activism and community support to combat transphobia and violence.
