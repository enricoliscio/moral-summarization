Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about Julie Berman, a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered. The article also talks about the broader issues of violence against the trans community and the efforts to support them.

The user mentioned that the summary should include as many morally framed words as possible. They provided a list of those words, so I need to make sure to incorporate them where appropriate. The summary needs to be concise, no more than 200 words, and should end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I'll start by identifying the key points: Julie's murder, her activism, the emotional impact on her community, the statistics about violence against trans people, and the support efforts. I should use words like "murdered," "transphobia," "violence," "vulnerable," and "support" to maintain the moral tone.

I also need to mention the study about the high rates of assault and harassment, as well as the efforts by organizations to provide support. It's important to highlight that despite these efforts, the community remains vulnerable, which ties back to the moral framing.

I'll structure the summary to first state Julie's death, then her activism, the emotional response, the statistics, and finally the ongoing support efforts and the reminder of the community's vulnerability. I should keep each sentence focused and avoid unnecessary details to stay within the word limit.

Let me make sure I'm using the right words and that the summary flows logically. I'll start with her murder, move to her role as an activist, the community's reaction, the study's findings, the support programs, and end with the reminder of the community's continued vulnerability.

I think that covers all the necessary points while preserving the moral framing. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include the key morally charged words and keep it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, in an incident that reflects the ongoing violence and transphobia faced by the trans community. Two years prior, at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, Berman had spoken about the murder of a trans friend, only for the same fate to befall her. Her friend, Davina Hader, described the situation as "heartbreaking," noting that Berman had warned her community to remain vigilant. Toronto police charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder, though he is not a known member of the LGBTQ community. Berman, a long-time activist and hairdresser, had dedicated nearly three decades to community events at The 519, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. Her death follows a pattern of violence in Toronto’s trans community, with three fatalities in recent years. A 2015 study highlighted that 20% of Ontario’s trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted due to their identity, and 34% had been verbally threatened or harassed. Despite support programs and awareness events, many trans individuals remain vulnerable, with Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasizing that violence is a tragic reality for many. Berman’s murder serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by the trans community, even in a city striving to be welcoming. END OF SUMMARY.
