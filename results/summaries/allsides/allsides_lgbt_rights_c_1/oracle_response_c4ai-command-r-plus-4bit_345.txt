SUMMARY: On December 22, 2019, Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was assaulted and murdered. Two years prior, at a trans day of remembrance event, Ms. Berman gave a speech about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. In a heartbreaking turn of events, Ms. Berman herself became a victim of the violence she had spoken out against. Ms. Berman's friend, Davina Hader, recalled her activism and commitment to her community, stating that she had asked her community members to be more vigilant in the face of transphobia and violence. The Toronto Police Service found Ms. Berman suffering from head injuries and transported her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A 29-year-old man, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder. According to a study by the Trans PULSE project, trans people in Ontario are targets of violence, with 20% having been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans. The study also noted that many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% have experienced harassment by police. The executive director of Pride Toronto, Olivia Nuamah, stated that the high rates of violence within the trans community are alarming and that trans women often do not feel safe. She also highlighted the efforts of Toronto Pride and other organizations to provide support and education to the trans community through events, workshops, and programs. Ms. Berman's death is a tragic reminder of the ongoing struggle for safety and inclusion faced by the trans community.
