Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman's murder, preserving the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

Julie Berman was a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered in December 2019. Two years earlier, at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, she gave a speech about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Her friend Davina Hader mentions how ironic it is that she was killed in the same way she was advocating against. The police found her with head injuries and charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. He's not part of the LGBTQ community, which adds to the sense of injustice.

The article also talks about the study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario, with 20% physically assaulted and 34% verbally harassed. Many don't report these incidents, and some even report harassment by police. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto points out that violence is a common issue for trans people, especially in Toronto where three such deaths occurred recently.

The community is trying to address this through events and support programs, but there's still a lack of resources, leaving many vulnerable. The article ends by highlighting Julie's dedication and the impact of her death as a wake-up call about the ongoing issues in the trans community.

I need to make sure the summary captures these points, emphasizing the moral issues like systemic violence, lack of safety, and the community's efforts to address it. Also, the emotional impact and the irony of her death after advocating against transphobia should be included.

Let me structure this: start with Julie's murder, her activism, the context of her speech, the statistics on violence, the community's response, and the call to action. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral framing is clear.

I should also mention the study's findings to back up the high rates of violence and the community's efforts to support each other despite the challenges. Ending with the importance of awareness and vigilance ties it all together.

Alright, time to put it all into a coherent summary that flows well and hits all the key points without being too lengthy.

SUMMARY:  
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019, two years after delivering a powerful speech at a Trans Day of Remembrance event about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Her friend, Davina Hader, described the tragedy as deeply ironic, as Berman had dedicated her activism to addressing such violence. Berman, a long-time community member and advocate, was found with head injuries and pronounced dead. Colin Harnack, a non-LGBTQ community member, was charged with her murder.  

The article highlights the systemic violence faced by trans individuals, with a 2015 study showing 20% of Ontario’s trans people experiencing physical or sexual assault and 34% facing verbal harassment. Many incidents go unreported, and some trans individuals even face harassment from police. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasized that violence is a frequent reality for trans people, particularly in Toronto, where three trans individuals were killed in recent years.  

Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and education, resources remain insufficient, leaving many trans individuals vulnerable. Julie Berman’s death serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by the trans community, underscoring the need for vigilance, awareness, and systemic change. END OF SUMMARY.
