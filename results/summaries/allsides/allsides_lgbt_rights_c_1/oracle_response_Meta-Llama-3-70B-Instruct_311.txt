SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, a heartbreaking incident that highlights the alarming rates of violence against the trans community. Berman was a vocal advocate against transphobia, having spoken about the murder of a trans friend at a 2017 Trans Day of Remembrance event. Her own murder is a devastating example of the very issue she was fighting against. Police have charged Colin Harnack, 29, with second-degree murder. Berman's activism was driven by her commitment to her community, which faces high rates of violence, with 20% of trans people in Ontario having been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% verbally threatened or harassed. The incident is a stark reminder of the need for greater support and awareness for the trans community, which continues to struggle with vulnerability and marginalization. END OF SUMMARY.
