SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was tragically murdered on December 22, 2019. Just two years prior, she had spoken out against transphobia at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, sharing the story of a trans friend who was murdered. Her own murder is a heartbreaking example of the very violence she was trying to raise awareness about. According to a 2015 study, trans people in Ontario are disproportionately targeted by violence, with 20% experiencing physical or sexual assault and 34% facing verbal threats or harassment. Many trans people do not report these incidents to the police, and a staggering 24% have been harassed by police themselves. The trans community is left vulnerable, and Berman's murder serves as a painful reminder of the high rates of violence they face. Her death is a devastating loss for the community, and her activism will be deeply missed.
