SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and found with head injuries in a Toronto residence. This tragic event is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence faced by the trans community, which Berman had been vocal about through her activism. In a poignant irony, Berman had spoken about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017. Her death is a heartbreaking example of the very issue she was fighting against. The trans community is disproportionately targeted by violence, with studies showing that 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. Berman's murder is the third violent death in Toronto's trans community in recent years, highlighting the urgent need for greater support and action to address the systemic violence faced by trans individuals.
