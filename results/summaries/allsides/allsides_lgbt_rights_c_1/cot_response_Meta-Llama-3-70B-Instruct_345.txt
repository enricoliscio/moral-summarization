SUMMARY:
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was tragically murdered on December 22, 2019. Just two years prior, she had spoken out against transphobia at a Trans Day of Remembrance event, where she shared the story of a trans friend who had been murdered. Her own murder is a heartbreaking reminder of the alarming rates of violence faced by the trans community. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and 34% had been verbally threatened or harassed. Many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and 24% reported having been harassed by police. Berman's murder is a sad and unfortunate reminder that, for many in the trans community, violence is a part of life. Her activism and legacy will be well missed. END OF SUMMARY.
