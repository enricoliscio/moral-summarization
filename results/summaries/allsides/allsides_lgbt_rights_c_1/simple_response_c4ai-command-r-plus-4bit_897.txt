SUMMARY: On December 22, 2019, Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered, suffering head injuries in a residence in Toronto. Her death is a tragic reminder of the persistent violence and dangers faced by the trans community. Berman had been vocal about transphobia and the murder of her trans friend in a 2017 speech, and her own death reflects the very issues she sought to address. The Trans PULSE project study in Ontario revealed alarming rates of violence and assault against trans individuals, with 20% of respondents reporting physical or sexual assault and 34% reporting verbal threats or harassment. Despite efforts by organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide support and raise awareness, trans individuals continue to face high rates of violence and vulnerability. Berman's death underscores the urgent need for greater vigilance and action to address the pervasive issues of transphobia and violence. Her advocacy and commitment to political issues facing the trans community will be sorely missed. END OF SUMMARY.
