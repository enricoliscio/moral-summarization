SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and suffering head injuries. This heartbreaking incident is a stark reminder of the transphobia and violence that the trans community faces. Berman was a vocal advocate for her community, having spoken about the murder of a trans friend at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017. Her own murder is a tragic irony, highlighting the need for increased vigilance and support for the trans community. According to a 2015 study, trans people are targets of specifically directed violence, with 20% having been physically or sexually assaulted and 34% verbally threatened or harassed. The study also noted that many trans people do not report these assaults to the police, and that 24% have been harassed by police. Berman's death is the third violent death in Toronto's trans community in recent years, underscoring the need for greater awareness and support. END OF SUMMARY.
