SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was brutally murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and left with head injuries. This tragic event is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence faced by the trans community, a reality that Berman herself had spoken out against at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017. Her murder is a heartbreaking irony, as she had been vocal about the need for vigilance and action against transphobia. The incident is part of a disturbing trend, with three violent deaths in Toronto's trans community in recent years. Despite efforts by organizations like Pride Toronto and The 519 to provide education, support, and advocacy, many trans individuals remain vulnerable to violence and harassment. Berman's murder is a call to action, highlighting the need for greater awareness, inclusivity, and protection for the trans community.
