Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman's murder while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, Julie was a trans rights activist in Toronto who was murdered in 2019. Two years earlier, she spoke at a Trans Day of Remembrance event about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Now, the same fate happened to her. Her friend Davina Hader mentions how heartbreaking it is that the violence she spoke against befell her. The police found her with head injuries and charged Colin Harnack with murder. He's not part of the LGBTQ community.

Julie was involved in community events for almost 30 years, working as a hairdresser. The article mentions a study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario, with many not reporting assaults. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto says violence is a part of life for many trans individuals. There have been three violent deaths in Toronto's trans community recently, including Alloura Wells, whose case was mishandled by authorities. Organizations are trying to support the community but resources are insufficient. The trans march in Toronto is one of the largest globally, highlighting community strength and awareness.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral aspects. Focus on Julie's activism, her murder, the study's stats, community's vulnerability, and the ongoing efforts despite challenges.

Let me structure it: Start with Julie's murder and her activism. Mention the study's findings on violence against trans people. Highlight the community's struggle and the need for support. End with the significance of events like the trans march.

I should make sure to include the emotional impact, the systemic issues, and the community's resilience. Keep it concise but cover all main points.

SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, just over two years after she spoke at a Trans Day of Remembrance event about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Her friend, Davina Hader, described the tragedy as heartbreaking, noting that the violence Julie had fought against had now claimed her life. Julie, a long-time community activist, had asked her friend not to release footage of her 2017 speech, which highlighted the vulnerability of trans individuals. Toronto police charged Colin Harnack with her murder, and while he is not part of the LGBTQ community, the incident underscores the ongoing violence faced by trans people. A 2015 study revealed that 20% of Ontario’s trans population had experienced physical or sexual assault, with 34% facing verbal harassment. Olivia Nuamah, executive director of Pride Toronto, emphasized that violence is a grim reality for many in the trans community, particularly vulnerable individuals like Julie. Despite efforts by organizations like The 519 and Toronto Pride to provide support and education, resources remain insufficient. Julie’s murder serves as a stark reminder of the challenges trans individuals face, even in a city known for its LGBTQ2+ inclusivity. Her legacy as a committed activist will be deeply missed. END OF SUMMARY.
