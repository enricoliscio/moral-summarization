SUMMARY:
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Berman was a passionate advocate for her community and had spoken out against transphobia and violence. In a heartbreaking turn of events, she suffered the same fate as a trans friend she had mourned in a 2017 speech. Berman was assaulted and sustained head injuries that led to her death. The suspect, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder. Berman's friends and members of The 519, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, are grieving her loss. They describe her as a lovely and committed individual who actively participated in community events and political issues. Berman's death highlights the alarming rates of violence experienced by the trans community, with studies indicating that trans individuals are often targets of assault and harassment. It also underscores the need for more support and protection for vulnerable members of the community, as current programs are insufficient to address the pervasive issues of violence and discrimination. The trans march during Toronto Pride celebrations in June stands as a testament to the community's strength and resilience in the face of these challenges. Berman's death serves as a tragic reminder of the ongoing struggle for safety and equality faced by trans individuals. END OF SUMMARY.
