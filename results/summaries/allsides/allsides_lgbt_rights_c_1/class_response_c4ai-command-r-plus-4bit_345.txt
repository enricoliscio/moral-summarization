SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019, suffering head injuries in a brutal assault. Berman had been vocal about transphobia and violence against the trans community, and her death is a heartbreaking incident that highlights the ongoing struggles of trans people in Toronto. Berman had previously spoken about the murder of a trans friend and advocated for more vigilance within her community. Unfortunately, she became a victim of the very violence she was trying to prevent. This tragic event underscores the vulnerability of trans individuals and the high rates of violence they experience. According to a study by the Trans PULSE project, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, with an additional 34% verbally threatened or harassed. The trans community in Toronto continues to face significant challenges, with three violent deaths in recent years, including Berman's murder. Activists and organizations like Pride Toronto and The 519 are working tirelessly to provide education, support, and awareness, but their efforts are not enough to prevent these tragic fatalities. Berman's death is a somber reminder of the urgent need for better protection and support for trans individuals, who deserve to feel safe and welcomed in our society.
