SUMMARY: Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019. Two years prior, at a trans day of remembrance event, Ms. Berman gave a speech about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. In a tragic twist, she herself became a victim of the violence she had spoken out against. Ms. Berman was found with head injuries and pronounced dead at the hospital. Police have charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. Ms. Berman's death highlights the ongoing issue of violence against trans individuals, with studies indicating high rates of assault and harassment within the trans community. Toronto has seen several violent deaths within its trans community in recent years, including that of Alloura Wells in 2017. Despite efforts by organizations like Pride Toronto and The 519 to provide support and raise awareness, trans individuals continue to face significant risks of violence and harassment. Ms. Berman's death serves as a tragic reminder of the ongoing struggle for trans rights and the need for greater protection and support for the trans community. END OF SUMMARY.
