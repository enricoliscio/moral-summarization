SUMMARY:
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered in December 2019, just over two years after she gave a speech about transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. Ms. Berman's death is a tragic example of the very issues she advocated against. The trans community is facing high rates of violence and harassment, with trans people being specifically targeted for assaults and verbal threats. This is evidenced by a 2015 study which found that 20% of Ontario's trans people had been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and 34% had been verbally threatened or harassed. Furthermore, 24% reported being harassed by police. The article also mentions other violent deaths within Toronto's trans community, including that of Alloura Wells, whose case was mishandled by the police and The 519 community centre. Despite efforts by organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide education, support, and awareness, many within the trans community still feel vulnerable and at risk. The murder of Ms. Berman is a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle for safety and equality faced by the trans community. Her friends and colleagues remember her as a lovely and committed activist who will be sorely missed.
