SUMMARY:

Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was murdered on December 22, 2019, in a heartbreaking incident that highlights the alarming rates of violence faced by the trans community. Berman had spoken out against transphobia at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017, where she shared the story of a trans friend who had been murdered. Two years later, she suffered head injuries in an assault and was pronounced dead at the hospital. A 29-year-old man has been charged with second-degree murder. Berman's activism had focused on raising awareness about the struggles and vulnerabilities faced by the trans community, who are often targets of specifically directed violence. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. The incident is a sad reminder of the need for greater support and inclusivity for the LGBTQ2+ community. END OF SUMMARY.
