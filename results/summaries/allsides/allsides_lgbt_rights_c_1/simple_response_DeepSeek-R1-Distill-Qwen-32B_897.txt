Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman's murder while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article carefully.

The article starts by mentioning Julie Berman, a trans rights activist in Toronto, who was murdered in 2019. She had given a speech at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017, talking about transphobia and a friend who was murdered. The fact that she was killed two years later is ironic and tragic, which is a key point to highlight.

Davina Hader, a friend, mentions the emotional impact of Julie's murder, especially since Julie had asked her not to release a video from the 2017 event. The police found her with head injuries and charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. It's important to note that Harnack isn't part of the LGBTQ community, which adds to the sense of targeted violence.

Julie's activism and her involvement with The 519, an LGBTQ advocacy group, are crucial. She had been a hairdresser and involved in community events for decades. Her struggle to survive underscores the challenges faced by many in the trans community.

The article also references a 2015 study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario. This data supports the moral argument about the systemic issues and lack of safety for trans individuals. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto comments on the prevalence of violence and the community's efforts to raise awareness through events and programs, but notes that these are insufficient.

The mention of Alloura Wells' death in 2017 and the criticism of police and community centers handling her case adds context about past failures and the need for better support systems. The trans march during Toronto Pride is highlighted as a significant event, emphasizing community strength and awareness.

Overall, the summary should convey the tragedy of Julie's death, the context of transphobia and violence, the community's response, and the ongoing challenges faced by trans individuals. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and maintain the moral tone about the community's vulnerability and the need for support and justice.
