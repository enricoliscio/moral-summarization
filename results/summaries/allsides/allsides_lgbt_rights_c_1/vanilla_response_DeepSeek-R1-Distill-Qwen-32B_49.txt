Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Julie Berman's murder. Let me read through the article first to get the main points. 

Okay, Julie Berman was a Toronto trans rights activist who was murdered on Dec. 22, 2019. She had spoken at a Trans Day of Remembrance event in 2017 about transphobia and the murder of a friend. Now, two years later, she herself was killed. Her friend Davina Hader mentions how heartbreaking it is that the same issue she spoke about happened to her. 

The police found her with head injuries in her residence and charged Colin Harnack with second-degree murder. Harnack isn't known in the LGBTQ community. Julie was involved with The 519 for almost 30 years, working as a hairdresser and advocating for vigilance in her community. 

The article also mentions a study showing high rates of violence against trans people in Ontario. Olivia Nuamah from Pride Toronto points out that violence is a common issue for trans individuals, especially women. There have been three violent deaths in Toronto's trans community recently, including Alloura Wells, whose case was mishandled by authorities. 

Since then, organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 have been running support programs, but they're still not enough. The trans march during Toronto Pride is one of the largest globally, aiming to raise awareness and show community strength. Nuamah considers Julie's murder an alarming incident highlighting the ongoing violence against trans people. Julie was committed to her community and will be missed.

So, the summary should include Julie's background, her murder, the context of her activism, the study's statistics, the impact on the community, and the efforts to support them. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key points without too much detail.
