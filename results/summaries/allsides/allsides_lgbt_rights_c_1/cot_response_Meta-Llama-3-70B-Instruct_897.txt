SUMMARY:
Julie Berman, a Toronto trans rights activist, was tragically murdered on December 22, 2019. Her death is a heartbreaking reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Just two years prior, Berman delivered a speech at a trans day of remembrance event, vocal about the transphobia in Toronto and the murder of a close friend. Her friend, Davina Hader, described Berman as a lovely person who was committed to the political issues facing her community. Through her activism, Berman was asking her community members to be more vigilant and aware of the dangers they face. Unfortunately, her life was cut short in a brutal and alarming incident. The trans community is left vulnerable, and this senseless murder is a sad reminder of the violence and harassment they face daily. END OF SUMMARY.
