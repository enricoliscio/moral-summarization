SUMMARY: Trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered in Toronto on December 22, 2019, in a heartbreaking incident that underscores the persistent violence and vulnerability faced by the trans community. Two years prior, Ms. Berman had spoken out against transphobia and the murder of a trans friend. In a tragic twist of fate, she herself became a victim of the very violence she had tried to bring awareness to. Ms. Berman was assaulted and suffered head injuries, and was pronounced dead at the hospital. The suspect, Colin Harnack, has been charged with second-degree murder.

Ms. Berman's death is not an isolated case. According to a 2015 study, 20% of trans people in Ontario have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, with an additional 34% verbally threatened or harassed. The trans community experiences high rates of violence, and despite efforts by organizations like Toronto Pride and The 519 to provide education, support, and awareness, many within the community are still left vulnerable. The murder of Ms. Berman serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles and dangers faced by trans individuals, and the need for continued activism and support. Her commitment to political issues facing her community will be greatly missed.
END OF SUMMARY.
