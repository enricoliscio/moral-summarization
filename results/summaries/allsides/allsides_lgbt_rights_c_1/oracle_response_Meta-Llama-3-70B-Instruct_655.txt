SUMMARY:

Toronto trans rights activist Julie Berman was murdered on December 22, 2019, after being assaulted and suffering from head injuries. This heartbreaking incident is a stark reminder of the high rates of violence the trans community experiences. Berman had spoken out against transphobia in Toronto, highlighting the struggles of her community, including the murder of a close friend. Her activism was a call to action, urging her community to be more vigilant. Sadly, she became a target of specifically directed violence, a fate that many trans people face. According to a 2015 study, 20% of Ontario's trans people have been physically or sexually assaulted for being trans, and 34% have been verbally threatened or harassed. The trans community is left vulnerable, with many not feeling safe. Berman's death is an alarming incident that should raise awareness about the violence faced by the trans community. Her legacy will be remembered through her activism and commitment to her community.
