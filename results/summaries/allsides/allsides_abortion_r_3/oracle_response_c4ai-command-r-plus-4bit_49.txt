SUMMARY: Democrats are taking significant steps to protect abortion access and reproductive rights in response to recent state-level laws that restrict abortion. Senator Cory Booker has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and plans to take executive action to advance reproductive rights. He also aims to pursue legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and fund abortions overseas. Senator Kristen Gillibrand argues that restricting abortion access is "against Christian faith" and the Constitution, emphasizing the separation of church and state. Other candidates, including Joe Biden, support enshrining abortion rights into federal law. Democratic lawmakers are also reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to safeguard abortion and Roe v. Wade, highlighting the urgency to protect women's reproductive rights. These efforts demonstrate Democrats' commitment to doubling down on access to abortion and taking action against any erosion of Americans' control over their bodies.
