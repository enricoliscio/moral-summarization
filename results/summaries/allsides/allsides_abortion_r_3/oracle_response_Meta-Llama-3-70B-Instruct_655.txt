SUMMARY:

Democrats are doubling down on their efforts to protect and expand abortion access, amidst a coordinated attack from states like Georgia and Alabama that have recently passed laws to restrict and erode Americans' rights to control their own bodies. Presidential hopefuls like Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand, and Joe Biden are taking steps to prove they're the most pro-choice candidate. Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and pursue legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law, ensuring that women's reproductive rights are protected and enshrined. Gillibrand argues that laws restricting access to abortion are against Christian faith and the Constitution, and would eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal dollars to pay for abortions. Democratic lawmakers are also taking urgent steps to protect abortion access, sounding the alarm on the danger to women's reproductive rights and commanding immediate action to respond to the five-alarm fire threatening their lives.
