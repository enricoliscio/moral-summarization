SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential candidates are intensifying their efforts to protect abortion access in response to recent state laws restricting it. Sen. Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive and legislative actions to protect abortion, including codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and vows to enshrine abortion access into federal law and eliminate the Hyde Amendment. Frontrunner Joe Biden's campaign also supports enshrining abortion rights into federal law if necessary. Democratic lawmakers are pushing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion access and Roe v. Wade. Sen. Richard Blumenthal warns of a "five-alarm fire" threatening women's reproductive rights. The candidates aim to prove themselves as the most pro-choice candidate in the 2020 presidential election.
