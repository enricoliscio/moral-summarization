SUMMARY: Democrats are taking strong action to protect abortion access in response to recent state laws that restrict it. Senator Cory Booker has proposed creating an office dedicated to reproductive freedom and plans to take executive action to safeguard abortion rights. Senator Kristen Gillibrand argues that restricting abortion access is against the Christian faith and the Constitution. She and other candidates want to enshrine abortion access into federal law. Joe Biden also supports this effort. Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act to protect Roe v. Wade, the law that legalized abortion. They believe that reproductive rights are under attack and urgent action is needed to protect women's lives and control over their bodies.

END OF SUMMARY.
