SUMMARY:
Democrats are making strong efforts to protect abortion access in the face of recent state-level restrictions. Presidential hopefuls are vying to be the most pro-choice candidate, with Sen. Cory Booker proposing a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and a comprehensive plan to protect abortion rights through executive action and legislation codifying Roe v. Wade. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that abortion restrictions are "against Christian faith," citing free will and the separation of church and state. Candidates are pushing to enshrine abortion access into federal law, with frontrunner Joe Biden also supporting this move. Democratic lawmakers are also taking immediate steps to safeguard abortion rights across America, reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act to protect Roe v. Wade, the law that legalized abortion. The urgency of their efforts underscores the perceived danger to women's reproductive rights and the need to protect Americans' rights to control their own bodies.
