SUMMARY: In response to recent state-level laws restricting abortion access, several Democratic presidential candidates are taking steps to showcase their commitment to reproductive rights and position themselves as the most pro-choice candidate. Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey, has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and released a comprehensive plan to protect abortion rights through executive and congressional actions. Senator Kristen Gillibrand of New York argued that laws restricting abortion access are contrary to both the Constitution and Christian faith. She and other candidates want to enshrine abortion access into federal law. Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner, also expressed support for codifying abortion rights into law if necessary. Additionally, Democratic lawmakers are pushing for the "Women's Health Protection Act," a measure that has been introduced annually since 2013 to safeguard abortion and Roe v. Wade. Senator Richard Blumenthal emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that women's reproductive rights are under significant threat.
