Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access in the spotlight. The article mentions several candidates and their plans. Let me break it down.

First, the context: States like Georgia and Alabama have passed restrictive abortion laws, so Democrats are focusing on this issue. The article mentions several candidates taking steps to show they're pro-choice.

Cory Booker is one of them. He's proposing a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and a plan to protect abortion rights through executive and congressional actions. He wants to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and fund abortions internationally.

Kristen Gillibrand is another candidate. She argues that restrictive laws are against Christian faith and the Constitution. She wants to enshrine abortion access into federal law and eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which stops federal funds from covering abortions.

Joe Biden's campaign says he supports making abortion rights federal law if needed. Also, Democrats are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act," which has been before Congress since 2013 to protect abortion rights.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should mention the key points: the states passing laws, Democrats' response, Booker's office and plan, Gillibrand's stance on faith and the Hyde Amendment, Biden's support, and the reintroduced bill.

I should make sure the summary is clear and concise, hitting all these points without getting too detailed. Also, I need to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." without using markdown.

Let me piece it together. Start with the states passing laws, then the Democrats' efforts, each candidate's main point, and the legislative action. Keep it under 200 words.

Wait, I should check the word count. Let me write a draft:

"Democrats are intensifying efforts to keep abortion access prominent after states like Georgia and Alabama passed restrictive laws. Candidates like Cory Booker plan to create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom and codify Roe v. Wade. Kristen Gillibrand argues against restrictive laws, linking them to Christian faith and the Constitution, and aims to eliminate the Hyde Amendment. Joe Biden supports federalizing abortion rights. Lawmakers are reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act to safeguard Roe v. Wade."

That's concise. Maybe add a bit more detail about the measures each candidate is taking without exceeding the word limit.

Finalizing the summary, making sure it's under 200 words and covers all key points.
