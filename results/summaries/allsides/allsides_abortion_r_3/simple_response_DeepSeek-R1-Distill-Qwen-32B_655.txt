Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. It's about Democrats responding to state laws restricting abortion by pushing for federal protections. 

The key points are that several candidates, like Cory Booker and Kristen Gillibrand, are taking strong pro-choice stances. Booker wants to create an office to handle reproductive rights and codify Roe v. Wade. Gillibrand argues against state restrictions, linking it to Christian faith and separation of church and state. Biden supports enshrining abortion rights federally. They're also reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act.

I need to make sure the summary highlights the moral aspects, like the right to control one's body and the constitutional issues. Also, the sense of urgency from the Democrats is important. I should keep it under 200 words and make sure it's clear and concise, capturing the main actions and arguments without getting too detailed.

Let me structure it: start with the overall response, then mention each candidate's specific actions, their moral arguments, and the legislative efforts. Make sure to include the moral framing each candidate uses, like Booker's coordinated response and Gillibrand's religious angle.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language natural. Also, remember to end with the specified tokens. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. 

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure each point is covered succinctly while maintaining the moral perspective presented in the article.

SUMMARY:  
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to safeguard abortion access amid state-level restrictions, with several 2020 presidential candidates emphasizing their pro-choice stances. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has proposed a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and vowed to protect abortion rights through executive and legislative actions, including codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) argued that restricting abortion violates both the Constitution and Christian faith, emphasizing the separation of church and state. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's campaign supports enshrining abortion rights federally if needed. Democrats are also reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to defend Roe v. Wade, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) warning of an urgent threat to women's reproductive rights. These efforts reflect a moral commitment to protecting bodily autonomy and countering state-level challenges to abortion access. END OF SUMMARY.
