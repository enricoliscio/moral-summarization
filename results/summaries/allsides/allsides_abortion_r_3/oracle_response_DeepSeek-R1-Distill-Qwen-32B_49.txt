Okay, so I need to help this user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the morally framed words as possible, and it should be concise, under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about Democrats responding to state-level restrictions on abortion by taking various steps to protect and promote abortion access. Key figures include Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand, and Joe Biden, each proposing different measures like creating a new office, challenging the Hyde Amendment, and supporting federal legislation.

I need to identify the morally charged words used by the author. These include "doubling down," "access," "restrict," "create," "reproductive," "protect," "action," "erode," "control," "pursue," "legislation," "fund," "restricting," "against," "faith," "imposing," "enshrine," "challenged," "eliminate," "bars," "steps," "legalized," "danger," "command," "risk."

I should structure the summary to highlight the Democrats' proactive measures against state restrictions. I'll mention each candidate's specific actions, using the moral terms where appropriate. For example, Cory Booker's plan to create an office and take executive actions to protect abortion access. Gillibrand's argument against laws being against Christian faith and the Hyde Amendment. Biden's support for federal legislation. The Democrats introducing the Women's Health Protection Act, emphasizing the danger to women's rights.

I need to ensure the summary flows well, covers all key points without being too verbose, and retains the moral language to reflect the author's framing. I'll also make sure to keep it under 200 words and end with the specified tokens.

SUMMARY: Democrats are intensifying efforts to safeguard abortion access amid state-level restrictions, with candidates like Cory Booker proposing a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" to protect abortion rights.

Joe Biden supports enshrining abortion rights federally. Lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect Roe v. Wade, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal warning of a "five-alarm fire" threatening women's rights. Democrats emphasize the urgency to prevent erosion of reproductive freedom and control over bodily autonomy.
