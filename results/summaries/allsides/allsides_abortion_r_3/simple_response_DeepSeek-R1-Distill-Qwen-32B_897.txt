Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Democrats focusing on abortion access. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to get the main points.

First, the article mentions that Democrats are making abortion a key issue because states like Georgia and Alabama have passed restrictive laws. Several presidential candidates are taking strong pro-choice stances. Cory Booker is proposing a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom and wants to protect abortion rights through executive and legislative actions, including codifying Roe v. Wade. He also plans to fund abortions internationally.

Then, Kristen Gillibrand is arguing that anti-abortion laws are against Christian faith, emphasizing free will and separation of church and state. She wants to enshrine abortion access into federal law and eliminate the Hyde Amendment. Joe Biden's campaign is also supporting this idea if needed.

Additionally, Democrats are reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act to protect abortion rights, with a sense of urgency as reproductive rights are under threat.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral arguments, like the Christian faith angle and the urgency of protecting rights. It should also mention the specific actions each candidate is taking. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.
