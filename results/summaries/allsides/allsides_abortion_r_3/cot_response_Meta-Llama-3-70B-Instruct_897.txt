SUMMARY:
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to protect abortion access, framing it as a matter of "reproductive freedom" and "rights" to control one's own body. Presidential hopefuls like Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand, and Joe Biden are taking steps to prove their pro-choice stance. Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to respond to "relentless efforts to erode Americans' rights." Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and go against the principles of "democracy" and "separation of church and state." Democratic lawmakers are also pushing for the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade. They sound the alarm, warning of a "five-alarm fire" and "danger to women's reproductive rights." END OF SUMMARY.
