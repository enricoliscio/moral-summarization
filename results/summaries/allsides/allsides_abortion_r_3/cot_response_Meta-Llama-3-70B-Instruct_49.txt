SUMMARY:
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to protect abortion access, framing the issue as a matter of "reproductive freedom" and "rights" to control one's own body. In response to "relentless efforts" by states like Georgia and Alabama to "erode" Americans' rights, presidential hopefuls like Cory Booker and Kristen Gillibrand are taking a strong stance. Booker vows to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and pursue legislative action to "codify Roe v. Wade into federal law." Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and the Constitution, emphasizing the importance of "free will" and "separation of church and state." Democratic lawmakers are also sounding the "alarm" about the "danger" to women's reproductive rights, urging immediate action to protect abortion access. END OF SUMMARY.
