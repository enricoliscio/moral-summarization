SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential hopefuls are intensifying their efforts to protect abortion access in response to recent state laws restricting abortion. Sen. Cory Booker has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and vowed to take executive action on his first day in office to protect abortion rights. He also plans to pursue legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand claimed that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and promised to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions. Frontrunner Joe Biden's campaign announced support for enshrining abortion rights into federal law if necessary. Democratic lawmakers are also taking action, reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade. The measure has been proposed annually since 2013.
