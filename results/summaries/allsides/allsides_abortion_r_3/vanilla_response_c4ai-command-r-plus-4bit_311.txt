SUMMARY: In response to recent state-level laws restricting abortion access, several Democratic presidential candidates are emphasizing their commitment to protecting reproductive rights. Cory Booker has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and plans to take executive and legislative action to safeguard abortion rights. Kristen Gillibrand argues that abortion restrictions are contrary to Christian values and the Constitution. Both candidates, along with Joe Biden, support codifying abortion rights into federal law. Additionally, Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion access nationwide. These efforts reflect the Democrats' strategy to keep abortion access a key issue in the political agenda.
