Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access prominent. Let me read through the article first.

The article mentions that several states like Georgia and Alabama have passed restrictive abortion laws. In response, Democratic presidential candidates are stepping up their pro-choice stance. 

Cory Booker is proposing a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom." His plan includes executive actions to protect abortion rights and wants to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. He also plans to fund abortions overseas.

Kristen Gillibrand is arguing that restrictive laws are against Christian faith and the Constitution. She wants to enshrine abortion access into federal law and eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions.

Joe Biden's campaign supports making abortion rights federal law if necessary. Democrats are also reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect Roe v. Wade, which has been in Congress since 2013.

I should make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures all key points: the states passing restrictive laws, the candidates' responses (Booker, Gillibrand, Biden), their specific proposals, and the reintroduction of the bill.

I need to structure it clearly, maybe starting with the states' actions, then each candidate's stance, and the legislative efforts. Keep it factual and to the point.
