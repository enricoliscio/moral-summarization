SUMMARY: 
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to safeguard abortion access in response to recent laws passed in states like Georgia and Alabama that restrict abortion. Several Democratic presidential candidates are vying to be the most pro-choice contender, with Cory Booker pledging to establish a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and unveiling a comprehensive plan to protect abortion rights through executive and congressional action. Kristen Gillibrand, another 2020 candidate, argues that restricting abortion access is "against Christian faith," emphasizing free will and the separation of church and state. 

Democrats seek to enshrine abortion access into federal law to counter state-level challenges. Gillibrand also promises to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions. Joe Biden's campaign similarly supports codifying abortion rights into law if necessary. Democratic lawmakers are taking immediate steps to protect abortion access nationwide, reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act to safeguard abortion and Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized it. They emphasize the urgency of the situation, warning that women's reproductive rights are in grave danger.
