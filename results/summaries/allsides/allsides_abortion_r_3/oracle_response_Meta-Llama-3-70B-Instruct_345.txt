SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential hopefuls are doubling down on their efforts to protect abortion access, creating a coordinated response to the restrictive laws passed in states like Georgia and Alabama. Sen. Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to prevent the erosion of Americans' rights to control their own bodies. He will also pursue legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and fund abortions overseas. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand claims that laws restricting access to abortion are "against Christian faith" and will work to enshrine abortion access into US federal law, eliminating the Hyde Amendment that bars federal funding for abortions. Democratic lawmakers are taking steps to protect abortion access, introducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to sound the alarm on the danger to women's reproductive rights. They are commanding urgency and immediacy, as all lives are at risk.
