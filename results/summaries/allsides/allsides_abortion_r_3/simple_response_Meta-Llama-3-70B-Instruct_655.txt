SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential hopefuls are taking a strong stance in support of abortion rights, condemning recent state laws that restrict access to abortion as an attack on Americans' rights to control their own bodies. Sen. Cory Booker proposes creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and taking executive and legislative actions to protect abortion, including codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and violate the separation of church and state. Both candidates, along with frontrunner Joe Biden, aim to enshrine abortion access into US federal law. Democratic lawmakers are also taking action, reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade. The moral imperative is clear: protecting women's reproductive rights is essential to preserving democracy and upholding Christian values of free will. The urgency is palpable, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal warning of a "five-alarm fire" threatening women's lives.
