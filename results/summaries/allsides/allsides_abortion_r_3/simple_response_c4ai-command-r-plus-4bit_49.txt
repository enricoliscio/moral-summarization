SUMMARY: Democrats are taking a stand against recent laws passed in states like Georgia and Alabama that restrict abortion access, with several 2020 presidential candidates proposing measures to protect and expand reproductive rights. Sen. Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to safeguard abortion rights, while Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that restricting abortion access is "against Christian faith." Candidates are also calling for abortion rights to be enshrined in federal law, and for the elimination of the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funding for abortions. Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion. These efforts reflect a coordinated response to what is seen as a coordinated attack on reproductive freedom, with urgent action needed to safeguard the rights and health of women across America.

END OF SUMMARY.
