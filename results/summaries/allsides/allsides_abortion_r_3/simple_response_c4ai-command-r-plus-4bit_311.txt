SUMMARY: In the face of increasing state-level restrictions on abortion, Democratic presidential hopefuls are taking a stand to protect reproductive rights and freedom of choice. Sen. Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to safeguard abortion access, while Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that restricting abortion is "against Christian faith" and the Constitution. Both candidates, along with Democrat frontrunner Joe Biden, support codifying abortion rights into federal law. Democratic lawmakers are also reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to safeguard abortion and Roe v. Wade, emphasizing the urgency of preserving reproductive rights for all Americans.
