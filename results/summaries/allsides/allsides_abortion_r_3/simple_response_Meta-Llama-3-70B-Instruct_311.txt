SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential hopefuls are taking a strong stance on protecting abortion access in response to recent state-level restrictions. Sen. Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to protect abortion rights on his first day in office. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and violate the separation of church and state. Both senators, along with frontrunner Joe Biden, support enshrining abortion rights into federal law. Democratic lawmakers are also pushing for the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade. The moral framing of this issue is clear: restricting abortion access is a threat to women's reproductive rights and autonomy, and goes against the principles of democracy and Christian faith. It is imperative that lawmakers take urgent action to protect these rights.
