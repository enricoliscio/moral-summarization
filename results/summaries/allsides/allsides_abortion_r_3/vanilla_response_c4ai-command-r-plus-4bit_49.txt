SUMMARY: Democratic presidential candidates are emphasizing their support for abortion rights following recent state-level efforts to restrict abortion access. Cory Booker has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and plans to take executive action to protect abortion rights. Kristen Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion are "against Christian faith" and has pledged to eliminate the Hyde Amendment. Joe Biden also supports codifying abortion rights into federal law if necessary. Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade at the federal level. These efforts reflect a coordinated response by Democrats to push back against state-level abortion restrictions and ensure abortion access across America.
END OF SUMMARY.
