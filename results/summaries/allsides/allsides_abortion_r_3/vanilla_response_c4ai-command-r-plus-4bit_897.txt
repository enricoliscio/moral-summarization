SUMMARY: Democrats are taking steps to highlight their commitment to abortion access after recent laws passed in Georgia and Alabama restricting abortion. Senator Cory Booker has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and released a plan to protect abortion rights through executive and congressional actions. Senator Kristen Gillibrand has argued that abortion restrictions are "against Christian faith," and she, along with other candidates, wants to enshrine abortion access into federal law. Joe Biden has also expressed support for abortion rights. Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade. Senator Richard Blumenthal emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that women's reproductive rights are under significant threat. These efforts reflect Democrats' focus on maintaining and expanding abortion access.
