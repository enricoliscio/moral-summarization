Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article is about Democrats responding to state-level restrictions on abortion by taking various steps to protect access. 

First, I need to identify the key points. The main actions include creating a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom, legislative efforts to codify Roe v. Wade, funding abortions overseas, and opposing the Hyde Amendment. Also, there's the argument against state laws from a Christian faith perspective and the introduction of the Women's Health Protection Act.

I should make sure to include the morally charged words the author used, like "doubling down," "restrict," "protect," "erode," "control," "enshrine," "challenge," "fund," "danger," "risk." I need to weave these into the summary naturally without losing the essence of each candidate's stance.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll start by mentioning the overall effort, then detail each candidate's specific actions, and conclude with the urgency they're emphasizing.

Let me structure it: start with the Democrats' efforts, mention Booker's office and his plan, then Gillibrand's religious angle, Biden's support, and the legislative steps like the Women's Health Protection Act. Highlight the danger and risk to show the urgency.

I should make sure each sentence flows logically, using the moral terms to convey the intensity of their stance. Avoid jargon but keep the language strong and focused on the moral implications.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and that all key points are covered with the appropriate moral framing.

SUMMARY:  
Democrats are intensifying efforts to keep abortion access a priority, responding to state laws like those in Georgia and Alabama that restrict it. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" to protect abortion rights, including executive actions and legislation to codify Roe v. Wade federally. He also plans to fund abortions overseas. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that restricting abortion is "against Christian faith" and the Constitution, advocating for federal enshrinement of abortion access and eliminating the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions. Meanwhile, Joe Biden supports codifying abortion rights if necessary. Democrats are also advancing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to safeguard Roe v. Wade, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal warning of an urgent "danger" to women's rights. The party is taking decisive steps to counter state-level challenges, emphasizing the moral imperative to protect reproductive freedom and control over one's body. END OF SUMMARY.
