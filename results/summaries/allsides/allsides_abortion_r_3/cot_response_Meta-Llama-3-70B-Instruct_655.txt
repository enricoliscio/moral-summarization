SUMMARY:
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to safeguard abortion access in response to restrictive laws passed in states like Georgia and Alabama. Presidential hopefuls Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand, and Joe Biden are vying to prove themselves as the most pro-choice candidate. Booker plans to establish a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to "advance reproductive rights" on his first day in office. Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and violate the principles of "free will" and "democracy." Democratic lawmakers are pushing to enshrine abortion rights into federal law, warning of a "five-alarm fire" that threatens women's reproductive rights. They aim to "sound the alarm" and convey the "urgency and immediacy" of protecting these rights. END OF SUMMARY.
