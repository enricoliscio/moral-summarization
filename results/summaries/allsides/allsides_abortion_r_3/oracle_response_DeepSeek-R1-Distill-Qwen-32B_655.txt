SUMMARY:  
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to maintain abortion access amid state-level restrictions, with several 2020 candidates showcasing their commitment to reproductive rights. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has proposed creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and plans to take immediate executive and legislative action to protect abortion rights, including codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. He also aims to fund abortions overseas. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) argues that restricting abortion is "against Christian faith" and the Constitution, advocating for federal legislation to enshrine abortion access. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's campaign supports enshrining abortion rights into law if necessary. Democratic lawmakers are also advancing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to safeguard Roe v. Wade, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) warning of an urgent "danger" to women's reproductive rights. The party is taking coordinated steps to counter state-level challenges, emphasizing the need to protect access and control over bodily autonomy. END OF SUMMARY.
