Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and pursue legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law, ensuring Americans' rights to control their own bodies. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand claims that laws restricting access to abortion are "against Christian faith" and would eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions.
