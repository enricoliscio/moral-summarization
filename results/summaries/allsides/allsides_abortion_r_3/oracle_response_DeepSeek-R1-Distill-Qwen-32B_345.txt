Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the query carefully. The user provided a news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access prominent, with several candidates taking specific steps. They also listed morally framed words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll need to understand the key points of the article. It mentions that Democrats are doubling down on their efforts after states like Georgia and Alabama passed restrictive laws. Candidates like Cory Booker are proposing new offices and plans to protect abortion rights, including executive actions and legislative steps. Others, like Gillibrand, are linking the issue to faith and the constitution. The article also talks about legislative efforts like the Women's Health Protection Act.

Now, the user wants a summary that includes as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. I need to make sure to incorporate words like "doubling," "access," "restrict," "create," "protect," "action," "erode," "control," etc. I should structure the summary to highlight the proactive measures by Democrats, emphasizing their commitment to reproductive rights and their response to state-level restrictions.

I should also note the specific actions each candidate is taking, such as Booker's office and legislative plans, Gillibrand's stance on faith, and the reintroduction of the Women's Health Protection Act. It's important to convey the urgency and the moral imperative they're emphasizing.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but comprehensive. I'll start by stating that Democrats are intensifying their efforts, then mention each candidate's actions, and conclude with the legislative push. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to frame the summary appropriately.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I include all the key points and the required words. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Once done, I'll present it as the user requested, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY:  
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to maintain abortion access as a central issue, responding to state-level restrictions in Georgia, Alabama, and others. Candidates like Cory Booker are proposing a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and legislative measures to protect abortion rights, including codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. Booker emphasized taking decisive executive and congressional actions to counter efforts to erode reproductive rights. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argued that restricting abortion violates both the Constitution and Christian faith, advocating for federal enshrinement of abortion access and eliminating the Hyde Amendment. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's campaign supports codifying abortion rights federally. Lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to safeguard Roe v. Wade, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal warning of an urgent "five-alarm fire" threatening women's rights. The Democratic focus on protecting reproductive freedom highlights their commitment to controlling bodily autonomy and countering state-level challenges. END OF SUMMARY.
