SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential hopefuls are intensifying their efforts to protect abortion access in response to recent state laws restricting abortion. Sen. Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive actions to protect abortion on his first day in office. He also proposes codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand claims that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and vows to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions. Frontrunner Joe Biden's campaign announced support for enshrining abortion rights into federal law if necessary. Democratic lawmakers are also pushing for the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade. The measure has been introduced in Congress every year since 2013. The Democrats are sounding the alarm on the urgency of protecting women's reproductive rights, which they believe are under threat.
