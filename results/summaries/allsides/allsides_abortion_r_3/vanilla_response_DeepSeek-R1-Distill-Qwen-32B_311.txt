Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access as a major issue. The article mentions several candidates and their plans. Let me start by identifying the key points.

First, it's about Democrats responding to state laws restricting abortion, like in Georgia and Alabama. They're making abortion access a central issue. Several candidates are taking steps to show they're pro-choice.

Cory Booker is mentioned as a candidate who plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom." His plan includes executive and congressional actions to protect abortion rights. He wants to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and fund abortions overseas.

Then there's Kristen Gillibrand, who argues that restricting abortion goes against Christian faith and the Constitution. She wants to enshrine abortion access into federal law and eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortions.

Joe Biden's campaign supports making abortion rights federal law if necessary. Democrats are also reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act," which has been proposed since 2013 to protect abortion rights.

I should make sure to include all these points concisely, keeping it under 200 words. I'll structure the summary to mention the candidates and their specific actions, the legislative efforts, and the overall strategy to counter state restrictions.
