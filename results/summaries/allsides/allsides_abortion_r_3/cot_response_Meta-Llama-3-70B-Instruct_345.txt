SUMMARY:
Democratic presidential hopefuls are taking a strong stance on protecting abortion access, condemning recent state laws as a "coordinated attack" on Americans' "rights to control their own bodies." Sen. Cory Booker vows to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to "advance reproductive rights" on day one of his presidency. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and violate the principle of "free will." Democratic lawmakers are sounding the "alarm" on the "danger to women's reproductive rights," pushing for the "Women's Health Protection Act" to enshrine abortion rights into federal law. The candidates are united in their urgency to protect abortion access, warning of a "five-alarm fire" threatening women's lives. END OF SUMMARY.
