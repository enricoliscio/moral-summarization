Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Democrats focusing on abortion access. Let me read through the article first.

The article talks about how Democrats are making abortion a key issue because states like Georgia and Alabama have passed restrictive laws. Several presidential candidates are taking steps to show they're pro-choice. Cory Booker wants to create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom and has a plan to protect abortion rights. He mentions taking executive actions on day one and possibly codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. He also wants to fund abortions internationally.

Then there's Kristen Gillibrand, who argues that restricting abortion goes against Christian faith and the Constitution. She wants to enshrine abortion access in federal law and eliminate the Hyde Amendment. Joe Biden's campaign says he supports making abortion rights federal law if needed. The article also mentions that Democrats are reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act, which has been before Congress since 2013, to protect Roe v. Wade. Blumenthal calls it a critical situation for women's rights.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: Democrats' efforts, Booker's plan, Gillibrand's stance, Biden's support, and the reintroduced bill. I'll make sure to mention the state-level restrictions and the candidates' responses. Also, note the mention of the Hyde Amendment and the urgency from Blumenthal.

Let me structure it: Start with Democrats responding to state laws, mention Booker's office and plan, Gillibrand's religious argument, Biden's support, and the reintroduced bill. Keep it concise and within the word limit.
