SUMMARY:
Democrats are intensifying their efforts to protect abortion access, which they frame as a fundamental "right" to control one's own body. In response to "relentless" efforts to restrict abortion, several presidential hopefuls are taking steps to prove their commitment to reproductive freedom. Sen. Cory Booker proposes a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and vows to take immediate executive action to "advance reproductive rights" and codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and violate the principle of "free will." Democratic lawmakers are also sounding the "alarm" about the "danger" to women's reproductive rights, urging immediate action to protect abortion access. END OF SUMMARY.
