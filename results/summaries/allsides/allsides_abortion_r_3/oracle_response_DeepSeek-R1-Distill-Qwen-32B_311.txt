Okay, I need to summarize this news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access prominent. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing from the original text. They provided a list of morally charged words that I should include as much as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. Democrats are responding to state laws restricting abortion by taking various steps. Candidates like Cory Booker are proposing new offices and legislation, while others like Gillibrand are linking the issue to faith and constitutional principles. The article also mentions legislative efforts like the Women's Health Protection Act.

I need to make sure to include words like "doubling down," "access," "restrict," "create," "reproductive," "protect," "action," "erode," "control," "pursue," "legislation," "fund," "against," "faith," "imposing," "enshrine," "challenged," "eliminate," "bars," "steps," "legalized," "danger," "command," "risk."

I should structure the summary to cover the main actions taken by the candidates, their proposed measures, and the legislative efforts. I'll start by stating that Democrats are intensifying their efforts, then mention each candidate's initiatives, and conclude with the legislative actions and the sense of urgency.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure each sentence includes as many of the morally framed words as possible without making it sound forced. For example, when talking about Booker, I can mention creating an office and pursuing legislation. For Gillibrand, linking the issue to faith and imposing beliefs. Finally, mention the legislative acts and the danger to rights.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and focused on the moral aspects highlighted in the original article. Let me draft the summary now, ensuring it flows well and includes all necessary points with the specified words.

SUMMARY: Democrats are intensifying their efforts to keep abortion access front-and-center, responding to state laws like Georgia and Alabama's restrictions. Candidates such as Cory Booker are proposing a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and legislative measures to protect abortion rights, including codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. Booker emphasized the need for a coordinated response to "erode" Americans' rights to control their bodies. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand argued that restricting abortion is "against Christian faith" and the Constitution, advocating for federal enshrinement of abortion access and eliminating the Hyde Amendment. Meanwhile, Joe Biden supports Congress enshrining abortion rights into law. Democrats are also advancing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to safeguard Roe v. Wade, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal warning of a "five-alarm fire" in the "danger" to women's reproductive rights, urging urgent action to "command" the risk. END OF SUMMARY.
