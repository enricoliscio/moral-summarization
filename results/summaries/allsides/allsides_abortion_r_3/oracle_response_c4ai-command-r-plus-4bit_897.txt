SUMMARY: Democrats are taking bold action to protect abortion access in the face of increasing restrictions passed by numerous states. Cory Booker, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has pledged to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to advance reproductive rights. He also plans to pursue legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. Another candidate, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, argues that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" as they impose religious beliefs on others and erode the separation of church and state. She and other candidates want to enshrine abortion access into federal law, eliminating barriers such as the Hyde Amendment. Joe Biden's campaign has also expressed support for such legislation. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to safeguard abortion rights and Roe v. Wade, which legalized it. They emphasize the urgency of taking steps to protect abortion access, as they believe it is under threat and women's reproductive rights are at risk.
