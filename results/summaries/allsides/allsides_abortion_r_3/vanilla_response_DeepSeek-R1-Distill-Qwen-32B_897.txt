Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access prominent. Let me read through the article first.

The article mentions that several states like Georgia and Alabama have passed restrictive abortion laws, prompting Democrats to focus more on this issue. They're doing this by having their presidential candidates take strong pro-choice stances. 

Cory Booker, a senator from New Jersey, is planning to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" if elected. His plan includes executive actions to protect abortion rights, funding for international abortions, and legislative efforts to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. That makes sense because he's taking a proactive approach.

Then there's Kristen Gillibrand, another candidate, who argues that restrictive abortion laws go against Christian faith and the separation of church and state. She also wants to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which currently restricts federal funds for abortions. That's a significant move as it would change how abortion is funded.

Joe Biden, the frontrunner, supports enshrining abortion rights into federal law if necessary. Plus, Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" again, which aims to protect Roe v. Wade. Sen. Blumenthal is emphasizing the urgency, calling it a critical issue for women's rights.

Putting it all together, the summary should highlight the main points: the states passing restrictive laws, the candidates' responses with specific plans, the legislative efforts, and the urgency they're emphasizing. I need to keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly, ensuring each key point is covered without going into too much detail.

I should start by mentioning the states passing restrictive laws, then each candidate's approach, the legislative measures, and the sense of urgency. I'll make sure to include the key elements like the White House office, codifying Roe v. Wade, eliminating the Hyde Amendment, and the reintroduction of the Women's Health Protection Act. That should cover the main aspects succinctly.
