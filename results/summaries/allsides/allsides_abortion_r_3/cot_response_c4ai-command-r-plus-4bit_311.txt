SUMMARY: 
Efforts to restrict abortion access have been met with a strong moral response from Democrats, who are committed to protecting reproductive freedom and women's rights. Several Democratic presidential candidates, including Cory Booker and Kristen Gillibrand, have proposed comprehensive plans to advance reproductive rights and freedom of choice. Booker has promised to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and take executive action to protect abortion rights, while Gillibrand has framed abortion access as a moral issue of free will and the separation of church and state, claiming that restricting access goes against Christian faith and democracy. Both candidates support enshrining abortion rights into federal law to safeguard against state-level challenges. Democratic lawmakers are also taking steps to protect abortion access across America by reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act, underscoring the urgency and immediacy of the threat to women's reproductive rights. These efforts reflect a coordinated moral response to recent state-level attacks on abortion rights, with Democrats working to ensure that women's lives and freedoms are protected.
