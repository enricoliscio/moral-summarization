SUMMARY:

Democrats are doubling down on their efforts to protect abortion access after numerous states passed laws to restrict it. Presidential hopefuls are taking steps to prove they're the most pro-choice candidate. Sen. Cory Booker plans to create a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" to advance reproductive rights and protect abortion. He vows to take immediate executive action to respond to efforts to erode Americans' rights to control their own bodies. Booker will also pursue legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law and fund abortions overseas. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand claims laws restricting access to abortion are "against Christian faith" and vows to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions. Democratic lawmakers are taking steps to protect abortion access across America, introducing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to sound the alarm on the danger to women's reproductive rights. They aim to enshrine abortion rights into federal law and command urgency to address the risk to women's lives.
