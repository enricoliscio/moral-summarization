Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access in the spotlight. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article talks about several Democratic presidential candidates taking strong stances on abortion rights. Cory Booker is proposing a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom and wants to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. He also mentions funding abortions overseas. Sen. Gillibrand is arguing that anti-abortion laws are against Christian faith and wants to eliminate the Hyde Amendment. Joe Biden supports enshrining abortion rights into federal law. Democrats are also reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act.

I need to make sure the summary captures the moral arguments each candidate is making. For example, Booker is framing it as a response to state-level restrictions, emphasizing the importance of protecting reproductive rights. Gillibrand brings in the moral aspect of Christian faith and the separation of church and state. The summary should highlight these moral perspectives without adding my own opinions.

I should structure the summary to first mention the overall effort by Democrats, then detail each candidate's stance and the moral arguments they're using. Keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it ends with the specified tokens.
