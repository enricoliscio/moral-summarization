SUMMARY:

Democratic presidential hopefuls are intensifying their efforts to protect abortion access in response to recent state laws restricting abortion. Sen. Cory Booker proposes creating a "White House Office of Reproductive Freedom" and taking executive and legislative actions to protect abortion, including codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand claims that laws restricting abortion access are "against Christian faith" and wants to enshrine abortion access into federal law, eliminating the Hyde Amendment. Joe Biden's campaign also supports enshrining abortion rights into federal law if necessary. Democratic lawmakers are pushing the "Women's Health Protection Act" to protect abortion and Roe v. Wade. The measure has been introduced in Congress every year since 2013. Democrats are sounding the alarm on the urgency of protecting women's reproductive rights, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal likening the situation to a "five-alarm fire".
