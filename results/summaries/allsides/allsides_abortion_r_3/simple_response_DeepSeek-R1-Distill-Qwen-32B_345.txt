Alright, I need to summarize this news article about Democrats' efforts to keep abortion access prominent. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about several Democratic candidates taking strong pro-choice stances. Cory Booker is creating a White House Office for Reproductive Freedom and plans to protect abortion rights through executive and legislative actions, including funding abortions overseas. Kristen Gillibrand is linking abortion restrictions to Christian faith, arguing it's against both the Constitution and Christian values. Joe Biden supports enshrining abortion rights into federal law. They're also reintroducing the Women's Health Protection Act.

I need to capture the moral arguments they're making. Booker emphasizes protecting rights and taking decisive action. Gillibrand brings in religious and constitutional principles. The article highlights the urgency and threat to women's rights, using strong language like "five-alarm fire."

I should structure the summary to include these elements, making sure it's concise and under 200 words. I'll start by stating the Democrats' focus on abortion access, then mention each candidate's specific actions and moral arguments, and conclude with the legislative efforts and the sense of urgency.

Let me draft this, ensuring it flows well and stays within the word limit. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing each candidate uses, like protecting rights, constitutional principles, and religious values. Also, I'll note the legislative steps they're taking to solidify their stance.
