SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition in the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness from Democrats. They claimed Democrats were "bypassing constitutional norms and basic standards of due process" and "broken" the rules of fairness by shutting them out of the process. Republicans argued that the president's lawyers were "denied" the chance to see evidence or call witnesses, and they were "restricted" from participating in the inquiry. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions, but Republicans felt they had a "right" to see what was going on. The protest turned into an hours-long sit-in, with Democrats accusing Republicans of creating a potential security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area. The incident highlights the intense partisan divide in the impeachment inquiry, with both sides accusing each other of unfairness and "outrage".
