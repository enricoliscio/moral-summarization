SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a scheduled deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats in the impeachment probe against President Trump. They claimed Democrats were "bypassing constitutional norms" and "broken" the rules of fairness by shutting them out of the process. Republicans argued that the president's lawyers were "denied" the chance to see evidence or call witnesses, and they were "restricted" from participating in the inquiry. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees had "access" to information and could ask questions. The protest, which involved lawmakers bringing electronic devices into a secure area, sparked outrage among Democrats, who threatened ethics charges. The incident highlights the deepening partisan divide in the impeachment inquiry, with both sides accusing each other of unfairness. The probe continues, with new demands for documents and testimony emerging.
