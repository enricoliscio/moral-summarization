Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully.

The article is about House Republicans storming a secure room during the impeachment probe. They disrupted a deposition, which upset Democrats. The key points are the Republicans' protest, the security concerns, the accusations of ethics violations, and the claims about fairness and due process.

I should note the Republicans' argument that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats are bypassing constitutional norms. Also, the Democrats' counterarguments about Republicans having access through committee members.

The article mentions the testimony of Laura Cooper and William Taylor, and how Republicans are challenging the process. There's also the legal aspect with FOIA requests and a court order for documents.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral arguments from both sides. I'll structure it to show the conflict, the security breach, the accusations, and the ongoing legal actions.

Let me make sure to include that Republicans brought electronics, which Democrats saw as a security risk. Also, the Democrats' response with ethics charges and the Republicans' dismissal of those claims.

Finally, I'll mention the ongoing legal processes, like the FOIA requests and the court order, to show the broader implications.

I think that covers the essential points while maintaining the moral framing from both parties. I'll write the summary now, keeping it concise and within the word limit.

SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room during the impeachment probe, disrupting a deposition and raising concerns about security and fairness. Democrats accused Republicans of bringing unauthorized electronics into a sensitive area, potentially compromising security, and demanded ethics charges. Republicans countered that the hearing was not classified and criticized Democrats for excluding them from the process, arguing it bypassed constitutional norms and due process. GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Mark Walker and Rep. Debbie Lesko, condemned the Democrats' handling of the impeachment inquiry, which they claimed lacked transparency and fairness. Democrats, led by Rep. Val Demmings, maintained that Republicans on the impeachment committees had access to participate and question witnesses. The protest delayed Laura Cooper's testimony, which ultimately occurred after several hours. Meanwhile, William Taylor's testimony about Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and Hunter Biden was challenged by Republicans, who cited contradictory witness accounts. Democrats continued to seek documents related to Ukraine, including communications between Giuliani and Pompeo, while a federal judge ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. END OF SUMMARY.
