SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, disrupting a scheduled deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats. They claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and due process in the impeachment inquiry. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions, and that the protest was a security breach since electronics were brought into the secure area. The deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper was delayed for five hours due to the protest. This comes as the impeachment inquiry continues, with a former diplomat testifying that Trump made military aid to Ukraine contingent on probing Joe Biden and his son. Republicans disputed the testimony, and new demands for documents and information have been issued. A federal judge has also ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related documents within 30 days.

END OF SUMMARY.
