SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, arguing for fairness and transparency in the process. They claimed that Democrats have broken the rules of fairness by denying Trump's lawyers access to evidence and subpoena power. The protest, led by Rep. Mark Walker and Rep. Debbie Lesko, highlighted the departure of the impeachment inquiry from established norms and due process. The Republicans argued that the investigation was being conducted unfairly and demanded their right to participate. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees were allowed to participate and had access to transcripts and information. The protest caused a disruption and led to accusations of potential security lapses due to the presence of electronic devices in the secure area. The sit-in lasted for hours, delaying the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper. Republicans also questioned the credibility of previous testimony by a former U.S. diplomat, William Taylor, claiming it was contradicted by other witnesses. The impeachment committees issued new demands for State Department documents, while Democratic senators filed a FOIA request for Ukraine-related documents. A federal judge also ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. The Republicans' protest highlighted the concerns over the fairness and transparency of the impeachment process.
END OF SUMMARY.
