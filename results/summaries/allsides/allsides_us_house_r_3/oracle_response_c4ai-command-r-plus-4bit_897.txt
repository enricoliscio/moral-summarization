SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump is being held, demanding fairness and protesting the Democrats' denial of their subpoena power and restrictions on the impeachment committees. Republicans argued that the impeachment inquiry is not following precedents, and their lawyers have been denied the chance to see evidence or call witnesses. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions, but Republicans brushed off these claims. The protest, which included lawmakers not on the impeachment committees, disrupted the deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper and resulted in a sit-in that lasted several hours. Republicans also questioned the testimony of former diplomat William Taylor, who alleged an "irregular" backchannel managed by Trump's personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani to push Ukraine into investigating Trump's political opponents. In response to the protest, Democrats threatened ethics charges against the Republican protesters and demanded an investigation into the potential security lapse caused by the presence of electronic devices in the secure room. The impeachment committees have issued new demands for State Department documents, while a federal judge has ordered the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days.
END OF SUMMARY.
