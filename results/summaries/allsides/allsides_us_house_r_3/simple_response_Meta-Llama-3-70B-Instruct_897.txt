SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition in the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness from Democrats. They claimed Democrats broke rules of fairness by shutting them out of the process. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions, and that's good enough. The protest led to a sit-in, with Republicans bringing electronics into the secure area, creating a potential security lapse. Democrats threatened ethics charges and an investigation into the breach. The impeachment inquiry is criticized for not following precedents, with Trump's lawyers denied access to evidence and Republicans denied subpoena power. The probe centers on Trump's communications with Ukraine over Joe Biden, with some witnesses testifying to an "irregular" backchannel pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

END OF SUMMARY.
