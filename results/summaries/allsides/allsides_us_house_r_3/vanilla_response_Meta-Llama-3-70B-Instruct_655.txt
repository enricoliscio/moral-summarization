SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room where impeachment probe depositions were being held, disrupting a scheduled testimony by Defense Department official Laura Cooper. They demanded fairness from Democrats, claiming they were shut out of the process. Democrats were enraged, accusing Republicans of bringing electronics into the secure area, potentially compromising security. Republicans argued that the hearing was not classified and that Democrats had broken rules of fairness. The protest was sparked by Democrats' handling of the impeachment inquiry, which Republicans claim is not following precedents. They argue that Trump's lawyers have been denied access to evidence and witnesses, and Republicans have been denied subpoena power. The incident has escalated tensions between the parties, with Democrats threatening ethics charges and Republicans accusing Democrats of bypassing constitutional norms.

END OF SUMMARY.
