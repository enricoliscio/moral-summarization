Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral terms involved.

The article describes a confrontation between House Republicans and Democrats during the impeachment probe. Republicans stormed a secure room, which Democrats saw as a security lapse. The Republicans were upset about being shut out of the process, accusing Democrats of bypassing constitutional norms and fairness. They used terms like "outrage," "broken," and "denied" to express their frustration. Democrats, on the other hand, accused Republicans of bringing electronics into a secure area, which they called a potential security breach. They also mentioned that Republicans were restricted from participating fully in the impeachment process, highlighting their "right" to access information.

I need to make sure the summary includes these moral words: broken, bypassing, outrage, following, denied, restricted, right, permitted, access, brought, push, press. I'll structure the summary to show both sides' perspectives, using these terms to convey the moral stances each party took. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the specified tokens.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each moral term is included where appropriate. I'll start by mentioning the Republicans storming the room, their accusations against Democrats, and the Democrats' counterarguments. I'll also include the specifics about the secure room, electronics, and the denied access to evidence and witnesses. Finally, I'll touch on the ongoing developments in the impeachment inquiry, like the subpoenas and the court order for documents.

I need to make sure the summary flows logically and covers all the key points without exceeding the word limit. Let me check the word count as I go to ensure it's within the limit. Once I'm satisfied with the content and the inclusion of the moral terms, I'll finalize the summary.

SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room during the impeachment probe, accusing Democrats of bypassing constitutional norms and fairness. They argued that Democrats had denied them access to evidence, witnesses, and subpoena power, claiming the process was restricted and unfair. Republicans brought electronic devices into the secure area, which Democrats called a potential security lapse, demanding ethics charges. GOP lawmakers countered that the hearing was not classified and that Democrats had broken the rules of fairness by excluding them. They called the Democrats' actions an outrage, asserting their right to participate. Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, accused Republicans of violating security protocols and threatened ethics charges. The protest disrupted a deposition with Laura Cooper, who eventually testified after a five-hour delay. Meanwhile, Democrats pushed for more documents related to Ukraine, including communications between Giuliani and Pompeo, as the impeachment inquiry continued. END OF SUMMARY.
