SUMMARY:
In an outrageous breach of security, House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, enraging Democrats who demanded ethics charges against the protesters. The Republicans, led by Rep. Mark Walker and Rep. Debbie Lesko, brushed aside Democrat complaints of unfairness and demanded fairness and due process in the impeachment inquiry. They argued that Mr. Trump's lawyers and Republicans have been unjustly denied access to evidence, witnesses, and subpoena power. In a sit-in protest, the Republicans disrupted the deposition of Defense official Laura Cooper, bringing in unauthorized electronic devices and potentially compromising security. Democrats were enraged by this breach of protocol and demanded charges against the protesters. The protest delayed Ms. Cooper's testimony by five hours, with members on both sides remaining mum on the details. The impeachment probe continues, with committees demanding State Department documents and text messages related to Ukraine. A federal judge also ordered the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. 
END OF SUMMARY.
