Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

So, House Republicans stormed into a secure room during the impeachment probe, causing a disruption. They were upset because they felt Democrats were being unfair. Democrats were angry because Republicans brought electronics into a secure area, which could be a security risk. They want ethics charges against the Republicans. The Republicans argued that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats were bypassing due process. They mentioned that the president isn't above or below justice, implying fairness.

The article also talks about the Democrats' impeachment process not following precedents, with Trump's lawyers and Republicans being denied access to evidence and subpoena power. Some Republicans protested, saying they should have the right to see what's happening, while Democrats countered that those on the committees could participate.

There was a sit-in protest, and the questioning was shut down, but the witness testified later. The testimony involved William Taylor, who said Trump tied military aid to Ukraine's investigation into Biden. Republicans claimed other witnesses contradicted this, calling it "second- and third-hand information."

Additionally, Democrats are seeking more documents, and a judge ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related documents, including Giuliani's communications.

Now, I need to summarize this, using as many of the author's moral words as possible: broken, bypassing, outrage, following, denied, restricted, right, permitted, access, brought, push, press.

I should structure the summary to highlight the conflict between Republicans and Democrats, the security breach, the fairness issue, and the implications of the testimony. I'll make sure to include the key events and the moral framing words where appropriate.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure it's concise and under 200 words. I'll mention the storming of the room, the security lapse, the ethics charges, the argument about fairness, the denied access, restricted work, the right to see, permitted participation, the brought electronics, the press for documents, etc.

I should also mention the key points about the testimony and the subsequent document requests. I'll keep each sentence focused and include the necessary moral terms without overcomplicating.

Alright, I think I have a good structure. Time to put it all together concisely.

SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room during the impeachment probe, sparking outrage as they accused Democrats of bypassing fairness. Democrats alleged a security lapse due to Republicans bringing electronics into the restricted area and demanded ethics charges. Republicans argued the hearing wasn't classified and claimed Democrats denied them access to evidence and subpoena power, restricting their involvement. They asserted the right to participate, while Democrats permitted committee members to ask questions. The protest disrupted the deposition of Laura Cooper, who eventually testified after hours of delay. William Taylor's testimony revealed Trump tied military aid to Ukraine's investigation into Biden, but Republicans dismissed it as second-hand information. Democrats pressed for more documents, including Giuliani's communications, while a judge ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related files. END OF SUMMARY.
