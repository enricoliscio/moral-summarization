SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition in the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness and transparency from Democrats. Republicans claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and due process, denying Trump's lawyers access to evidence and witnesses. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions, and that access to transcripts and information was available. The protest, which involved around 30 Republicans, was met with outrage from Democrats, who accused them of creating a potential security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area. Democrats threatened ethics charges against the protesters, while Republicans brushed off the complaints, saying the hearing was not classified. The incident highlights the deepening partisan divide in the impeachment inquiry.

END OF SUMMARY.
