SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, disrupting a scheduled deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats. The protest was over the Democrats' handling of the impeachment inquiry, which has denied Republicans certain privileges such as subpoena power and access to evidence. Republicans argued that the process was unfair and broke norms of due process. The protest caused a delay in the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper, who ultimately testified five hours late. Democrats responded by threatening ethics charges against the Republican protesters and calling for an investigation into the potential security lapse caused by electronics brought into the secure area. Meanwhile, the impeachment probe continued with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days.
END OF SUMMARY.
