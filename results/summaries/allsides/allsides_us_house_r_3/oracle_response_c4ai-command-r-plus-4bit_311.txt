SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, demanding fairness and accusing Democrats of bypassing constitutional norms and denying them their right to participate in the process. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees were permitted to participate and had access to information, while also accusing the protesters of creating a security lapse by bringing in electronics. The protest turned into a sit-in, delaying the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper. Republicans questioned the credibility of the impeachment inquiry, citing a lack of due process and contradiction in witness testimonies. Meanwhile, the impeachment committees demanded State Department documents and three Democratic senators filed a Freedom of Information Act request related to Ukraine. A federal judge also ordered the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. The actions of the Republicans and Democrats highlight the contentious nature of the impeachment process, with both sides pushing for their interpretation of fairness and justice.
END OF SUMMARY.
