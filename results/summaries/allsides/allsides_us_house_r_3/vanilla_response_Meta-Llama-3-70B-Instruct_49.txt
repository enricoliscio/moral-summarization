SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room where lawmakers were conducting an impeachment probe against President Trump, disrupting a scheduled deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats. The move enraged Democrats, who accused the Republicans of creating a potential security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area. Republicans argued that the hearing was not classified and that Democrats have broken the rules of fairness by shutting them out of the impeachment process. The protest was led by lawmakers who aren't on the impeachment committees but claim they have a right to see what's going on. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions, and that is good enough.

The incident occurred as the impeachment inquiry into Trump's communications with Ukraine continues, with Democrats accusing Trump of making military aid to Ukraine contingent on the country probing Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Republicans argue that the testimony of a former U.S. diplomat to Ukraine was contradicted by other witnesses.
