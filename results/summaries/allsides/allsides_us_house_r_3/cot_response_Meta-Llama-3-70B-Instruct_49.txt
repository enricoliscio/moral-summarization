SUMMARY:
House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a scheduled deposition in the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness and due process. They claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and shutting them out of the process. Democrats countered that Republicans had access to information and could participate in the inquiry. The protest was deemed an outrage by Democrats, who also accused Republicans of creating a potential security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area. The impeachment inquiry is centered around Trump's communications with Ukraine, which some Republicans argue is not following precedents for impeachment proceedings. The investigation has been marked by accusations of unfairness and restricted access to information. END OF SUMMARY.
