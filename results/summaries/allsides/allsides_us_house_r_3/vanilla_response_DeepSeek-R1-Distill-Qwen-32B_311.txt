Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about House Republicans storming a secure room during the impeachment probe against Trump. They were upset about fairness in the process. Democrats were angry because Republicans brought electronics into a secure area, which could be a security risk. They want ethics charges against the Republicans.

The Republicans argue that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats aren't following proper procedures. They feel shut out of the impeachment process. The Democrats, on the other hand, say that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions, so it's fair.

There's some tension over how the impeachment inquiry is being conducted. Trump's lawyers haven't been able to see evidence or call witnesses, and Republicans have been denied subpoena power. The protest led to a delay in the deposition of Laura Cooper, who eventually testified after five hours.

The article also mentions William Taylor's testimony about Trump linking military aid to Ukraine with investigations into Biden. Republicans are contesting this, saying his information was second-hand. Additionally, Democrats are pushing for more documents, including those related to Giuliani and Pompeo.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events: the protest, the security breach, the arguments about fairness, the impact on the deposition, and the broader context of the impeachment inquiry and document requests.

I should make sure to include key points like the Republicans' actions, Democrats' reactions, the specifics of the protest, the testimony delays, and the ongoing efforts to obtain more documents. Also, mention the judge's ruling on releasing documents.

Let me structure this step by step, ensuring I cover all critical elements without going over the word limit.
