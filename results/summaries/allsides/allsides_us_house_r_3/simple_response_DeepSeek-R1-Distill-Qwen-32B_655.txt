Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. The main event is House Republicans storming a secure room during the impeachment probe, which caused a disruption. They were upset about not being involved fairly in the process. Democrats were angered by this and the potential security breach with electronics. The Republicans argued that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats were ignoring fairness. 

I should highlight the conflict between the two parties, emphasizing the moral arguments each side made. The Democrats accused Republicans of ethics violations, while Republicans criticized the Democrats for bypassing constitutional norms. I also need to mention the impact on the deposition of Laura Cooper and the subsequent testimonies, especially William Taylor's, which added to the impeachment inquiry.

SUMMARY: House Republicans disrupted an impeachment deposition by storming a secure room, citing fairness concerns, while Democrats accused them of creating a security risk by bringing electronics. Republicans argued that the process lacked transparency and due process, with Rep. Mark Walker criticizing Democrats for bypassing constitutional norms. Democrats countered that Republicans on the impeachment committees could participate and access information, and they demanded ethics charges for the protesters. The disruption delayed the testimony of Laura Cooper, a Defense Department official, who eventually testified hours later. The incident followed former diplomat William Taylor's testimony, which detailed President Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, a claim Republicans disputed. Democrats continued their probe, issuing new document demands, while a federal judge ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. The ongoing conflict highlights deep partisan divisions over the impeachment process. END OF SUMMARY.
