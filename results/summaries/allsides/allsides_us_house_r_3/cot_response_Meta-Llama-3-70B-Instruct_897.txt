SUMMARY:
House Republicans stormed a secure room to protest the Democrats' handling of the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness and due process. They claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and shutting them out of the process. The protest, which Democrats called an outrage, disrupted a deposition and created a potential security lapse. Republicans argued that the hearing was not classified and that Democrats had broken the rules of fairness. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions, and that was good enough. The protest turned into an hours-long sit-in, with Democrats threatening ethics charges against the Republican protesters. The impeachment inquiry continues, with new demands for documents and testimony. END OF SUMMARY.
