SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room where lawmakers were conducting the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness and protesting the Democrats' breach of constitutional norms and due process. The Republicans argued that Mr. Trump's lawyers and Republicans have been denied access to evidence, witness testimony, and subpoena power. They asserted their right to participate in the impeachment process, while Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees were allowed to participate and access information. The protest created a potential security lapse due to the use of electronic devices in the secure area. Republicans dismissed these concerns, stating that the hearing was unclassified. This incident highlights the intense partisan divide surrounding the impeachment inquiry, with Republicans accusing Democrats of an "impeachment obsession" and Democrats pursuing an investigation into Mr. Trump's communications with Ukraine. The inquiry continues to unfold, with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days.
END OF SUMMARY.
