SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, demanding fairness and protesting the Democrats' handling of the process. The protest disrupted the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper and created a potential security lapse due to the presence of electronic devices. Democrats threatened ethics charges and demanded an investigation into the breach. Republicans countered that the hearing was unclassified and that they have been denied due process and subpoena power throughout the impeachment inquiry. The protest highlighted the stark partisan divide surrounding the impeachment process, with Republicans claiming their rights were being violated and Democrats defending the integrity of their investigation. The impeachment probe intensified with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents. The inquiry is focused on President Trump's communications with Ukraine and his alleged request for an investigation into political opponent Joseph Biden. END OF SUMMARY.
