SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, demanding fairness and protesting the exclusion of Republican lawmakers from the process. The Republicans argued that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry was bypassing constitutional norms and denying Mr. Trump's lawyers the right to see evidence or call witnesses. They accused the Democrats of breaking the rules of fairness and due process. In response, the Democrats claimed that Republicans on the committees were allowed to participate, ask questions, and access transcripts and information. The protest created a security lapse as Republican lawmakers carried electronics into the secure area. This prompted demands for ethics charges against the Republican protesters and an investigation into the breach. The Republicans dismissed these complaints, stating that the hearing was unclassified. The work of the impeachment committees has been restricted, even from some Republican members. The protest involved lawmakers who are not on the impeachment committees but who argued they had a right to oversee the process. The situation escalated with threats of ethics charges and an investigation into the security breach. Ms. Cooper's testimony was delayed due to the protest and details of her statements were not disclosed. This event occurred amid ongoing efforts to gather evidence related to Ukraine and Mr. Trump's communications.
END OF SUMMARY.
