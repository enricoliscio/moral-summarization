SUMMARY:
House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats in the impeachment probe against President Trump. They claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and due process, shutting them out of the process. Republicans argued that the president is not above justice, but neither is he below it. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees had access to transcripts and information. The protest turned into an hours-long sit-in, with Democrats accusing Republicans of bringing unauthorized electronic devices into the secure space, potentially creating a security lapse. The impeachment inquiry continues, with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents. END OF SUMMARY.
