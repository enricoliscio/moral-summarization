SUMMARY: On Wednesday, House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, demanding fairness and protesting the Democrats' handling of the process. The protest disrupted the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper and resulted in an hours-long sit-in. Democrats accused the Republicans of creating a security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area and demanded ethics charges be filed. Republicans countered that the hearing was unclassified and that they have been denied due process and subpoena power in the impeachment inquiry. The protest involved lawmakers who are not on the impeachment committees but who argued they have a right to see the proceedings. The impeachment probe continues to unfold, with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days.
END OF SUMMARY.
