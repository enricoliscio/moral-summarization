SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room where lawmakers were conducting an impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness from Democrats. They claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and due process, denying Trump's lawyers access to evidence and witnesses. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions, and that access to transcripts and information was available. The protest, which involved lawmakers bringing electronics into a secure area, sparked outrage among Democrats, who threatened ethics charges and a security breach investigation. The incident highlights the deepening partisan divide in the impeachment inquiry, with Republicans accusing Democrats of unfairness and Democrats accusing Republicans of disrupting the process. The probe continues, with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents.
