SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump is being conducted, protesting against the Democrats' bypassing of constitutional norms and denial of due process rights. Republicans demanded fairness and participation in the process, arguing that they have been restricted from subpoena power and access to evidence. They accused Democrats of breaking the rules of fairness and creating a potential security lapse by carrying electronics into the secure area. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees can participate and question witnesses, and that the investigation is being conducted following standard procedures. In the wake of the protest, ethics charges and a security breach probe were threatened against the Republican protesters. Meanwhile, the impeachment probe continues, with new demands for documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related communications within 30 days. The investigation has uncovered an "irregular" backchannel managed by Trump's personal attorney to push Ukraine into investigating political opponents. Republicans deny any wrongdoing, claiming that witness testimony is contradicted and based on second-hand information.
END OF SUMMARY.
