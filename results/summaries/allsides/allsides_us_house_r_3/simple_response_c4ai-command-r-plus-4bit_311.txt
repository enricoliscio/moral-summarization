SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, demanding fairness and protesting the exclusion of Republican lawmakers from the process. The Republicans argued that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry was bypassing constitutional norms and denying Mr. Trump's lawyers the chance to see evidence or call witnesses. They also highlighted the lack of subpoena power for Republicans and the restricted access to information for some members of the impeachment committees. In response, Democrats accused the Republicans of creating a security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area and called for ethics charges. The protest disrupted the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper, who ultimately testified five hours late. Meanwhile, the impeachment probe continued with demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. The Republicans dismissed William Taylor's testimony as second-hand information, contradicting other witnesses' accounts.
END OF SUMMARY.
