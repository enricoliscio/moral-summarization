SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump is being conducted, demanding fairness and accusing Democrats of bypassing constitutional norms and denying them their right to participate in the process. Democrats countered that Republicans have access to the impeachment proceedings through their membership on the relevant committees and have been permitted to ask questions and view transcripts. The protest caused a disruption in the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper, with Republicans arguing that the hearing was unclassified and their protest was justified. This incident has led to accusations of potential security lapses due to the use of electronics in the secure area and calls for ethics charges against the Republican protesters. Meanwhile, the impeachment probe continues with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. Republicans have questioned the credibility of witness testimony, claiming it is contradicted by other witnesses and based on second- and third-hand information.
END OF SUMMARY.
