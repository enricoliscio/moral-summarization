SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats, who they claim are "bypassing constitutional norms and basic standards of due process" in the impeachment probe against President Trump. Republicans argue they have been "denied" subpoena power and access to evidence, and that the process is not "following" traditional impeachment precedents. Democrats counter that Republicans on the committees have "access" to transcripts and information, and can participate in depositions. The protest, which involved lawmakers bringing electronic devices into a secure area, sparked outrage among Democrats, who threatened ethics charges and a probe into the breach. The incident has highlighted the intense partisan divisions surrounding the impeachment inquiry, with both sides accusing each other of "pushing" their own agendas.

END OF SUMMARY.
