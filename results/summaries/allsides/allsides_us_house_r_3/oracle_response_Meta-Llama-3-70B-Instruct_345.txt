SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a scheduled deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats, who they claim are "bypassing constitutional norms" and "broken" rules of fairness in the impeachment probe against President Trump. Republicans argue that Democrats have "denied" them subpoena power and "restricted" their access to evidence and witnesses. Democrats counter that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions, but Republicans claim they have a "right" to see what's going on. The protest turned into an hours-long sit-in, with Democrats accusing Republicans of bringing unauthorized electronic devices into the secure room, potentially "push[ing] in the Russian and Chinese" with them. The incident has sparked outrage, with Democrats threatening ethics charges against the Republican protesters. The impeachment inquiry continues, with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents.

END OF SUMMARY.
