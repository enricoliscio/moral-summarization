Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing words the author used. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main events and the moral language used.

The article talks about House Republicans storming a secure room during the impeachment probe against Trump. They were upset about fairness, and Democrats accused them of a security lapse by bringing electronics. Republicans argued that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats were bypassing due process. The impeachment process is being conducted without allowing Trump's lawyers to see evidence or call witnesses, and Republicans were denied subpoena power. Some GOP members protested, saying they have the right to access the proceedings, while Democrats said they could participate through the committees. Schiff threatened ethics charges, and Swalwell mentioned security concerns. The testimony of Laura Cooper was delayed, and William Taylor's testimony about Trump's actions was mentioned, with Republicans contradicting it. The committees are demanding more documents, and Democrats are using FOIA requests for Ukraine-related info.

Now, I need to include the morally framed words: broken, bypassing, outrage, following, denied, restricted, right, permitted, access, brought, push, press. I'll make sure these words are in the summary.

I'll structure the summary by highlighting the Republicans' protest, the security breach, the accusations of bypassing due process, the denied access, restricted process, their right to access, and the push for documents. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and end with the required tokens.

SUMMARY: House Republicans protested the impeachment probe against President Trump, storming a secure room and bringing electronics, which Democrats called a security lapse. They accused Democrats of bypassing constitutional norms and denied Republicans fairness, access to evidence, and subpoena power. GOP lawmakers argued they had a right to participate but were restricted. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could ask questions and access transcripts. Schiff threatened ethics charges, while Swalwell criticized the electronics breach. The protest disrupted Laura Cooper's testimony, which eventually occurred hours later. William Taylor's testimony about Trump's Ukraine actions was contradicted by Republicans. The committees pressed for more documents, and Democrats used FOIA requests to push for Ukraine-related information. END OF SUMMARY.
