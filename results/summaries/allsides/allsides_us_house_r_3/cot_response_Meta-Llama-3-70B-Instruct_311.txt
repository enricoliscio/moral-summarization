SUMMARY:
House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition in the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness and due process from Democrats. They claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and shutting them out of the process. The protest, deemed an outrage by some, was sparked by concerns that Republicans were being denied access to evidence and witnesses. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees had a right to participate and ask questions. The incident raised concerns about security, with some accusing Republicans of bringing unauthorized electronic devices into the secure room. The impeachment inquiry continues, with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents. END OF SUMMARY.
