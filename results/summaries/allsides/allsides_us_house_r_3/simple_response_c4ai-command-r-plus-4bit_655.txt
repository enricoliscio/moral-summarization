SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room where lawmakers were conducting an impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness and transparency in the process. The protest, led by Rep. Mark Walker and Rep. Debbie Lesko, argued that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry was bypassing constitutional norms and denying Trump's lawyers and Republicans the right to participate fully. They accused Democrats of breaking the rules of fairness by shutting them out of the process and restricting access to information. In response, Democrats defended their process, stating that Republicans on the committees could participate, ask questions, and access transcripts. The protest created a security lapse as Republicans brought electronics into the secure area, leading to calls for ethics charges against the protesters. The protest disrupted the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper, who ultimately testified five hours late. The impeachment probe continues with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents. The summary highlights the moral framing of the news article, focusing on the Republicans' demand for fairness and transparency in the impeachment process, and the Democrats' defense of their procedures.
END OF SUMMARY.
