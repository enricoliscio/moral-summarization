SUMMARY: Republican lawmakers staged an angry protest against the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump, storming the secure room where the investigation was taking place and causing a potential security breach. The Republicans' protest was met with outrage by the Democrats, who demanded ethics charges be brought against the protesters for their invasion of the secure facility. The Republicans, led by Rep. Mark Walker and Rep. Debbie Lesko, countered that they were fighting for fairness and due process, accusing the Democrats of bypassing constitutional norms and denying them subpoena power and access to witnesses. The protest disrupted the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper, who eventually testified five hours late. Republicans dismissed the testimony of former diplomat William Taylor, claiming it was "contradicted" by other witnesses. Meanwhile, the impeachment committees demanded State Department documents, and a federal judge ordered the release of Ukraine-related communications within 30 days. The entire episode reflects the highly charged and morally fraught nature of the impeachment inquiry, with both sides accusing the other of inappropriate behavior and unjustified obstruction.
END OF SUMMARY.
