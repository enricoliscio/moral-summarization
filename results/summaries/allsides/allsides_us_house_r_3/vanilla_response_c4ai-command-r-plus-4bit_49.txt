SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, demanding fairness and protesting the exclusion of Republicans from the process. The protest disrupted the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper and created a potential security lapse due to the presence of electronic devices. Democrats threatened ethics charges against the Republican protesters, while Republicans argued that the hearing was unclassified and that they had a right to participate. The protest turned into a sit-in, delaying Ms. Cooper's testimony by several hours. The protest came after a former U.S. diplomat testified that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Biden and his son. Republicans countered that this testimony was contradicted by other witnesses. The impeachment committees issued a new demand for State Department documents, while a federal judge ordered the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days.
END OF SUMMARY.
