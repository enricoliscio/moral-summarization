SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition in the impeachment probe against President Trump, demanding fairness from Democrats. Republicans claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and due process, denying them subpoena power and access to evidence. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions, and that the protest was a security breach, as electronics were brought into the secure area. The incident sparked outrage, with Democrats threatening ethics charges and a probe into the breach. The impeachment inquiry is being criticized for not following precedents, with Trump's lawyers denied access to evidence and witnesses. The controversy surrounds Trump's communications with Ukraine, which Democrats claim is an abuse of power, while Republicans argue it's a political witch-hunt.

END OF SUMMARY.
