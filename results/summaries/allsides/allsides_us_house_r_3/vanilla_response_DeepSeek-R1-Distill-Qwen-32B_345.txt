Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about House Republicans storming a secure room during the impeachment probe against Trump. They were upset about being excluded and brought electronics, which caused a security issue. Democrats are angry and want ethics charges. Republicans argue the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats are unfair. They mentioned Trump's lawyers can't see evidence, and the process isn't following precedents. The protest caused a delay in Laura Cooper's testimony. She ended up testifying after five hours, but details weren't shared. William Taylor's testimony about Trump linking military aid to Biden's investigation was a day before. Republicans say his info was second-hand. Committees are now demanding more State Department documents. Democrats filed FOIA requests, and a judge ordered documents to be released, including Giuliani's communications.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I should include the main points: the Republican protest, the security breach, the conflict over process fairness, Cooper's testimony delay, Taylor's testimony and its implications, and the subsequent document requests. I'll make sure to mention both sides' arguments and the legal actions taken afterward.

SUMMARY: House Republicans disrupted an impeachment probe session by storming a secure room, accusing Democrats of unfairness. They brought electronics, raising security concerns, and demanded ethics charges. Republicans argued the hearing wasn't classified and criticized Democrats for excluding them. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate. The protest delayed Laura Cooper's testimony, which eventually occurred after five hours. Cooper's details were not disclosed, but her testimony followed former diplomat William Taylor's claims that Trump linked military aid to Ukraine to investigating Biden. Republicans dismissed Taylor's testimony as second-hand. Committees sought more State Department documents, while Democrats filed FOIA requests and a judge ordered document releases, including Giuliani-Pompeo communications. END OF SUMMARY.
