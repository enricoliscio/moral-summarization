SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room where lawmakers were conducting an impeachment probe against President Trump, disrupting a scheduled deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats. The move enraged Democrats, who accused Republicans of carrying electronics into the secure area, creating a potential security lapse. Republicans claimed the hearing was not classified and that Democrats have broken rules of fairness by shutting them out of the impeachment process. The protest was led by lawmakers who aren't on the impeachment committees but say they have a right to see what's going on. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions. The incident led to threats of ethics charges against the Republican protesters. The deposition ultimately resumed, with Defense Department official Laura Cooper testifying five hours after she was scheduled to begin.

END OF SUMMARY.
