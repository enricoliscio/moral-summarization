Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points.

The article is about House Republicans storming into a secure room during the impeachment probe. They disrupted a deposition, which upset Democrats. The Republicans were upset because they felt the process was unfair. They brought electronics into a secure area, which Democrats saw as a security lapse and demanded ethics charges. Republicans argued that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats were bypassing due process.

I need to identify the morally framed words: broken, bypassing, outrage, following, denied, restricted, right, permitted, access, brought, push, press. I should use these words in the summary to maintain the original moral perspective.

The summary should be concise, under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event: Republicans stormed the room. Then mention the Democrats' reaction about security and ethics charges. Next, outline the Republicans' arguments about fairness and due process. Include details about the disrupted deposition, the Democrats' counterarguments, and the ongoing investigation.

I should make sure to include all the key elements without getting bogged down in too much detail. Also, ensure that the morally framed words are integrated naturally into the summary.

Let me structure it step by step: event, reactions from both sides, arguments about fairness, security concerns, and the ongoing process. That should cover the essential points while preserving the moral framing.

SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room during the impeachment probe, disrupting a deposition and demanding fairness, which Democrats accused of creating a security lapse by bringing electronics. Republicans argued that the Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and denied them access to the process. GOP lawmakers claimed the hearing was not classified and accused Democrats of breaking rules of fairness. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and had access to information. Republicans protested, calling the process an outrage and claiming it was not following precedents. The impeachment inquiry into Trump's Ukraine communications has restricted Republican subpoena power and denied Trump's lawyers access to evidence. Democrats defended the process, stating it was conducted fairly. The protest led to ethics charges being threatened, and the deposition was delayed. Testimony from Laura Cooper and William Taylor highlighted the irregular backchannel managed by Giuliani to press Ukraine into investigating the Bidens. Republicans argued Taylor's testimony was contradicted by other witnesses. The committees demanded more State Department documents, and a federal judge ordered the release of Ukraine-related documents, including Giuliani's communications. END OF SUMMARY.
