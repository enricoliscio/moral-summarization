Alright, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article talks about House Republicans storming a secure room during the impeachment probe against Trump. They were protesting the process, claiming it's unfair. Democrats were upset because Republicans brought electronics into a secure area, which could be a security risk. They want ethics charges against the Republicans.

The Republicans argue that the hearing they disrupted wasn't classified and that Democrats have been unfair by excluding them. They mention that Trump's lawyers haven't had access to evidence, and Republicans have been shut out of the process. The Democrats counter that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions.

There's mention of Laura Cooper's testimony being delayed because of the protest. Her testimony comes after William Taylor's, who said Trump tied military aid to Ukraine to investigations into Biden. Republicans are dismissing this, saying other witnesses contradict it.

The committees are now asking for more State Department documents, including texts and memos about pressuring Ukraine. Plus, some senators filed FOIA requests, and a judge ordered the State Department to release documents within 30 days.

So, the summary should cover the protest, security concerns, Republican claims, the impact on the testimony, and the subsequent document requests. I need to keep it under 200 words and make sure it's concise.
