SUMMARY:
House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition and demanding fairness in the impeachment probe against President Trump. Democrats were enraged, citing a potential security lapse and calling for ethics charges against the 30 or so Republican protesters. Republicans claimed the hearing was not classified and that Democrats had broken the rules of fairness by shutting them out of the impeachment process. The impeachment inquiry, which Republicans call an "obsession," has been criticized for not following precedents and for restricting access to evidence and witnesses. The protest was sparked by concerns over the "irregular" backchannel managed by Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to push Ukraine into investigating the Bidens. Democrats counter that Republicans have access to transcripts and information, but Republicans argue that they have been denied subpoena power and the chance to call their own witnesses.
