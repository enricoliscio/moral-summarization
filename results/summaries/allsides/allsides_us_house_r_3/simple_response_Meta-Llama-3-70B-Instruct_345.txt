SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room where impeachment probe depositions were being conducted, demanding fairness from Democrats. They claimed Democrats were bypassing constitutional norms and due process in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's communications with Ukraine. Republicans argued they were denied subpoena power, access to evidence, and the ability to call witnesses, while Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions. The protest, which involved around 30 Republican lawmakers, was met with outrage from Democrats, who claimed the Republicans brought electronic devices into the secure area, potentially compromising security. The incident has sparked a heated debate over the impeachment process, with both sides accusing each other of unfairness and lack of transparency.
