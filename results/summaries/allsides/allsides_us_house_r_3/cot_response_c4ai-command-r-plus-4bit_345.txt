SUMMARY: 
In a protest against the Democrats' handling of the impeachment inquiry, a group of House Republicans stormed a secure room where the investigation was taking place, enraging their political opponents. The Democrats demanded ethics charges against the Republican protesters, accusing them of a potential security violation by bringing electronics into the room. The GOP lawmakers brushed off these complaints, arguing that the hearing was unclassified and that they have been unfairly shut out of the impeachment process, obscuring the facts. This protest turned into a sit-in, delaying the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper by several hours. Republicans have criticized the impeachment inquiry as an injustice, denying Mr. Trump's lawyers the chance to see evidence or call witnesses, and accusing Democrats of unfairly incriminating the President. They claim that the Democrats' inquiry has been conducted unfairly and is an attempt to incriminate the President unlawfully. Republicans also questioned the credibility of previous witness testimony, stating that it was contradicted and based on second- and third-hand information. The impeachment committees have issued further demands for incriminating documents and witness communications. Meanwhile, a federal judge has ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related documents, including those involving Mr. Giuliani and Secretary Pompeo.
