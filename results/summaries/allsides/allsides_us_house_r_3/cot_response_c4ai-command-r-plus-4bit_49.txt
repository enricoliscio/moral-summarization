SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed a secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, enraging Democrats who accused them of a security breach and demanded ethics charges. The GOP lawmakers brushed off the complaints, complaining of unfairness and protested that Democrats have denied them the chance to participate fully in the impeachment process. They disrupted a hearing with Defense official Laura Cooper, which turned into a sit-in. Democrats accused the Republicans of an outrage and demanded they face ethics charges for breaching the secure room with electronic devices. The GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Mark Walker and Rep. Debbie Lesko, countered that Democrats are bypassing constitutional norms and are obsessed with impeachment without regard for justice or precedent. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff threatened ethics charges and Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson probed the breach. The protest highlighted the partisan divide and the moral framing of the impeachment inquiry, with Republicans accusing Democrats of unfairness and abuse of power. END OF SUMMARY.
