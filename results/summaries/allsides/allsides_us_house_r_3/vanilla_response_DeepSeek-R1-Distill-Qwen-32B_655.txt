Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the House Republicans storming the secure room during the impeachment probe. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article says that House Republicans entered the secure room where the impeachment probe against Trump was happening. They disrupted a deposition, which was supposed to take place. The Democrats were upset because the Republicans brought electronics into a secure area, which could be a security risk. The Democrats wanted ethics charges against the Republicans, but the Republicans argued that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats weren't being fair by excluding them from the process.

The Republicans feel that the Democrats are bypassing constitutional norms and due process. They mentioned that Trump isn't above justice but shouldn't be treated unfairly either. The Democrats, on the other hand, say that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions. They also pointed out that bringing in electronics was a security lapse.

The protest led to the questioning of Laura Cooper being shut down, and it turned into a sit-in that lasted hours. Eventually, Cooper testified five hours late. The article also mentions that a former diplomat, William Taylor, testified that Trump linked military aid to Ukraine with investigations into Biden, which the Republicans are contesting. They say his testimony was contradicted by others.

Additionally, the committees requested more State Department documents, and some senators filed FOIA requests. A judge ordered the State Department to release Ukraine-related documents, including Giuliani's communications with Pompeo.

So, the key points are: Republicans stormed the secure room, causing a disruption; Democrats accused them of security lapses; Republicans argued against unfair treatment; Cooper's testimony was delayed; Taylor's testimony about Trump's actions; Republicans contesting the findings; and ongoing document requests and legal actions.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, focusing on the main events and the conflict between the parties. I'll structure it to include the disruption, the reasons from both sides, the impact on the deposition, the context of the impeachment probe, and the subsequent actions like document requests and legal orders.
