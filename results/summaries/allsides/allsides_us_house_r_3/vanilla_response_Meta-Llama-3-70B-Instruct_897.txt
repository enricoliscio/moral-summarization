SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump was being conducted, disrupting a scheduled deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats. The move enraged Democrats, who accused Republicans of bringing electronics into the secure area, potentially compromising security. Republicans claimed the hearing was not classified and that Democrats have broken rules of fairness by shutting them out of the impeachment process. The protest was led by lawmakers who aren't on the impeachment committees but claimed they have a right to see what's going on. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees can participate and ask questions. The incident led to threats of ethics charges against the Republican protesters. Meanwhile, a former U.S. diplomat to Ukraine testified that Trump made military aid to Ukraine contingent on probing Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

END OF SUMMARY.
