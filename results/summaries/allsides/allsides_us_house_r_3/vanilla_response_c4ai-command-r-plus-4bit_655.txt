SUMMARY: House Republicans stormed the secure room where the impeachment probe against President Trump is being conducted, demanding fairness and protesting the exclusion of their party from the process. They argued that the impeachment inquiry is bypassing constitutional norms and denying Republicans subpoena power and due process. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees can participate, ask questions, and access transcripts and information. The protest resulted in an hours-long sit-in and disrupted the scheduled deposition of Defense Department official Laura Cooper. Republicans also dismissed concerns about potential security lapses due to the presence of electronic devices in the secure area. Meanwhile, the impeachment probe continues with new demands for State Department documents and a federal judge ordering the release of Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. Republicans claimed that the testimony of a former U.S. diplomat, William Taylor, was contradicted by other witnesses, alleging that it relied on second- and third-hand information.
END OF SUMMARY.
