Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. They provided the full text, so I'll start by reading through it carefully to understand the key points. The article is about House Republicans storming a secure room during the impeachment probe against President Trump. 

First, I notice that the Republicans entered a secure area, which Democrats saw as a security lapse. They brought electronics, which are usually banned. This action caused the deposition of Laura Cooper to be disrupted. The Republicans argue that the hearing wasn't classified and that Democrats are not following due process.

Next, the article mentions that the impeachment inquiry isn't following precedents, with Trump's lawyers and Republicans being excluded from key parts of the process. The Republicans involved in the protest aren't on the impeachment committees but claim they have a right to participate. Democrats counter that Republicans on the committees can already participate.

There are threats of ethics charges from Democrats and a security probe initiated by the sergeant at arms. The testimony of Laura Cooper was delayed, and her content wasn't disclosed. The article also touches on William Taylor's testimony about Trump's dealings with Ukraine, and the subsequent document requests from the committees and FOIA requests from Democrats.

I need to condense all this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main events: the Republican protest, the security breach, the disruption of Cooper's testimony, the arguments about fairness, the Democrats' response, and the implications for the impeachment process. I'll also mention Taylor's testimony and the resulting document requests.

I should ensure the summary is clear and concise, capturing the conflict between the parties, the procedural issues, and the ongoing developments in the impeachment inquiry. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the protest, moving to the consequences, and ending with the broader context of the investigation.

Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all the key points without getting too detailed. I'll avoid jargon and keep the language straightforward to ensure it's easily understandable.

Republicans argued the hearing was not classified and criticized Democrats for excluding them from the impeachment process. The protest led to ethics charges being threatened and a security probe. The deposition of Laura Cooper, a Defense Department official, was delayed but eventually held.
