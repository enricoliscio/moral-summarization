SUMMARY:

House Republicans stormed a secure room, disrupting a deposition and demanding fairness from Democrats in the impeachment probe against President Trump. They claimed Democrats were "bypassing constitutional norms" and "breaking the rules of fairness" by shutting them out of the process. Republicans argued that the president's lawyers were "denied" the chance to see evidence or call witnesses, and they were "restricted" from participating in the inquiry. Democrats countered that Republicans on the committees could participate and ask questions, but Republicans felt they had a "right" to see what was going on. The protest turned into an hours-long sit-in, with Democrats accusing Republicans of creating a potential security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area. The incident was deemed an "outrage" by some Democrats, who threatened to bring ethics charges against the protesters. The impeachment inquiry continues, with new demands for documents and testimony emerging.
