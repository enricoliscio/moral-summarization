Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user provided the article and an example of a summary. Let me read through the article first to understand its main points.

The article compares Hillary Clinton's political tactics to those of Richard Nixon, labeling her as a "ruthless politician." It mentions scandals from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks releases, suggesting Clinton's disregard for U.S. intelligence laws and the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play schemes. The article draws parallels between the 2016 Clinton campaign and Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, noting similarities in fundraising tactics, unethical behavior, and the use of questionable strategies. It also discusses Clinton's team, including Podesta, Mills, and Abedin, and their questionable actions, comparing them to Nixon's aides. The article suggests that while Nixon faced downfall due to investigative journalism, Clinton might not face the same fate because the media is less critical now. It ends by questioning whether Clinton would meet a Nixon-like fate if elected.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should focus on the key comparisons, the scandals mentioned, the unethical tactics, and the media's role. I'll structure it to highlight the parallels, the specific examples of Clinton's actions, and the implications of media support.

I should make sure to include that Clinton's campaign tactics resemble Nixon's, the use of WikiLeaks and Weiner's laptop as sources of scandals, the pay-for-play schemes, and the comparison of her team to Nixon's aides. Also, mention the media's role in possibly preventing a Nixonian downfall for Clinton.

Let me start drafting the summary, making sure it's concise and covers all these points without exceeding 200 words.
