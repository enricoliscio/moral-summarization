SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton's campaign has been marred by scandals, including revelations of a sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law and evidence of the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play profiteering. Clinton's tactics echo those of Richard Nixon, known as "Tricky Dick" for his anything-goes campaign style and flexibility on issues. Clinton's campaign, under the ruthless leadership of John Podesta, has been exposed as Nixonian to the core, with WikiLeaks revealing a lack of moral compass among her consultants. They lampooned and wrote off certain demographics, bartered for cash donations, and engaged in questionable activities such as tipping off debate questions and staging break-ins. Clinton's for-hire thugs even bragged about provoking violence and illegal voting practices. Emails also reveal Clinton's shifting positions on various issues, serving her political self-interest. Aides such as Podesta, Cheryl Mills, and Huma Abedin have been implicated in aiding and abetting Clinton's knavery and profiteering. Clinton has lied and stonewalled about her email server, the Foundation's schemes, and the Benghazi killings, resembling Nixon's attacks on messengers and claims of ignorance. The media's lack of investigative journalism raises concerns about Clinton's hubris going unpunished until after the election. END OF SUMMARY.
