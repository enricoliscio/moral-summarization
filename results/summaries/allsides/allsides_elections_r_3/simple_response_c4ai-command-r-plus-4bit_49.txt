SUMMARY: Another day, another scandal for Hillary Clinton, this time with striking similarities to Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal. The latest revelations from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks show Clinton's disregard for US intelligence laws and the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play schemes. Clinton's campaign, led by the ruthless John Podesta, has outspent her opponent, Donald Trump, and resembles Nixon's re-election committee, CREEP, in their cynical and immoral approach to politics. Clinton's team has no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics, while her aides bartered for her face time with plutocrats. The WikiLeaks email dumps and FBI investigations reveal Clinton's dishonesty about her email server, the Clinton Foundation's schemes, and the Benghazi killings. Clinton's tactics include provoking violence at Trump rallies, busing in illegal voters, and disrupting his events with protestors. Emails show Clinton's positions on key issues are driven by political self-interest. Her aides, such as Podesta, Mills, and Abedin, are complicit in her knavery and profiteering. Like Nixon, Clinton attacks the messenger and stonewalls, claiming memory lapses. Abedin's emails reveal Clinton's willingness to accept questionable speaking fees, and a Clinton family advisor described their shakedown efforts as "Bill Clinton Inc." Despite the shocking parallels, Clinton may escape Nixon's fate due to the lack of independent journalism and media bias in her favor.
END OF SUMMARY.
