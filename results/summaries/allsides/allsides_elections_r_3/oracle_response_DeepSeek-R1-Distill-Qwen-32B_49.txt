Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's comparing Hillary Clinton's actions to Nixon's, highlighting scandals, unethical behavior, and campaign tactics. The key elements are the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play, WikiLeaks disclosures, Podesta's ruthlessness, and Clinton's similarities to Nixon in campaign tactics.

I should start by stating the comparison between Clinton and Nixon, using words like "ruthless" and "playbook." Then mention the scandals from Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks, using terms like "scandal," "profiteering," and "pay-for-play." 

Next, I'll connect this to Nixon's campaign, using "Nixonian" and "CREEP." Highlight Podesta's role as the new Haldeman, showing ruthlessness. Include examples from WikiLeaks, like lampooning Latinos, bartering for face time, and Donna Brazile tipping off questions. 

Then, mention the ambush tapes and tactics like provoking violence and illegal voting. Compare Clinton's stonewalling and lying to Nixon's, noting the FBI investigation and Clinton's repeated claims of not remembering. 

Finally, address the media's role, using "backing" instead of investigating, and the question of whether Clinton will face a similar downfall as Nixon. Use "comeuppance" here.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points and ensure the moral words are included without overcrowding. I'll structure it to flow from the scandals to the comparison with Nixon, tactics, media's role, and the potential outcome.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring each paragraph covers these points succinctly while using the moral terms provided.

SUMMARY: The article compares Hillary Clinton's political tactics to Richard Nixon's, framing her as a ruthless politician who has "trumped" Nixon's "skullduggery" with her own scandals. Clinton's campaign, led by chairman John Podesta, is described as "Nixonian," leveraging the Clinton Foundation for "pay-for-play profiteering" and bartering with plutocrats for donations. WikiLeaks disclosures reveal her consultants' lack of a "moral compass," including lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and aides using cash donations to secure Clinton's face time. Clinton's campaign has been accused of "provoking violence" at Trump rallies and "bringing in voters by bus" to cast illegal ballots, tactics reminiscent of Nixon's "plumbers" who staged break-ins to leak information. Like Nixon, Clinton has "stonewalled" and "lied" about her actions, including the Benghazi killings and her email server scandal. Her aides, such as Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, have been implicated in "knavery" and "profiteering," raising questions about their political futures. The article suggests that Clinton's "hubris" may not face a Nixonian "comeuppance" due to media "backing" rather than investigative reporting. END OF SUMMARY.
