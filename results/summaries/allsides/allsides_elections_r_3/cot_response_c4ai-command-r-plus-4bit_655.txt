SUMMARY: The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless and immoral political tactics, drawing parallels between her and former president Richard Nixon. Clinton's campaign is described as "Nixonian to the core," with her consultants lacking a moral compass, lampooning Latinos as "needy," and bartering with plutocrats for favors. Emails reveal Clinton's flexible positions on issues such as fracking and trade deals, serving her political self-interest. The article highlights the disgraced former aides who have aided and abetted Clinton's knavery and profiteering, with some even facing jail time. Clinton has been caught in lies and stonewalling, similar to Nixon, and her campaign has been implicated in shady activities and provoking violence at Trump rallies. The media's lack of investigative journalism raises questions about the exposure of Clinton's hubris and potential comeuppance. END OF SUMMARY.
