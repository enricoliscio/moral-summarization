SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton's campaign has been exposed as a ruthless and cynical operation, leveraging the Clinton State Department for pay-for-play profiteering. The WikiLeaks emails reveal a morally bankrupt campaign team, with no qualms about lampooning Latinos as "needy" and Catholics as stuck in "medieval times". Clinton's aides bartered with plutocrats for face time, and the campaign has been accused of staging break-ins and disrupting rallies. The former secretary of state has been caught lying about her email server and the Clinton Foundation's shady activities. With a Nixonian playbook, Clinton's campaign has resorted to stonewalling and attacking the messenger. Will an elected President Hillary Clinton eventually meet the same fate as Nixon, or will the death of independent journalism ensure her hubris goes unpunished? END OF SUMMARY.
