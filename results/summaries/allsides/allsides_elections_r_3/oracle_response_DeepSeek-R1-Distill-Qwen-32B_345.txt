Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It compares Hillary Clinton to Nixon, highlighting scandals, pay-for-play schemes, and unethical campaign tactics. The author uses strong moral terms, so I need to reflect that tone.

I'll start by identifying the key scandals: Anthony Weiner's laptop, WikiLeaks emails, and Project Veritas ambush tapes. These are important for showing Clinton's unethical behavior. 

Next, I should mention the comparison to Nixon, focusing on their similar tactics like fundraising, break-ins, and cover-ups. The article also talks about Clinton's campaign strategies, such as using operatives to provoke violence and disrupt rallies, which are morally framed actions.

I need to include terms like "pay-for-play profiteering," "scandals," "trumped," and "nixonian." Also, the part about Clinton's team having no moral compass and the specific examples like lampooning Latinos and Catholics should be included.

I should also touch on the media's role, noting that they're backing Clinton instead of investigating, which ties into the "death of independent journalism" and whether Clinton will face a "comeuppance."

I'll structure the summary to first introduce the comparison, then list the scandals and unethical actions, mention the campaign tactics, and conclude with the media's role and potential consequences.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll make sure each point is brief but covers the necessary moral terms. Let me draft this step by step, ensuring I include as many of the provided words as possible without overcrowding the summary.

SUMMARY: The article compares Hillary Clinton to Richard Nixon, suggesting her unethical behavior and scandals surpass Nixon's "skullduggery." Clinton is accused of "pay-for-play profiteering" through the Clinton Foundation and leveraging the State Department for personal gain, as revealed by WikiLeaks disclosures. Her campaign tactics, including "provoking violence" at Trump rallies and "casting illegal ballots," mirror Nixon's "anything-goes" approach. Clinton's team, led by John Podesta, is described as "Nixonian," with aides bartering for her face time and lampooning Latinos and Catholics. The article highlights Clinton's "hacked" emails showing her positions hinged on self-interest, and her associates' "knavery" in "shakedown" efforts for Bill Clinton's "Bill Clinton Inc." The piece also notes Clinton's "stonewalling" and "cover-up" tactics, similar to Nixon's, and questions whether she will face a "comeuppance" given media's failure to investigate her wrongdoing. END OF SUMMARY.
