SUMMARY:

The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless and corrupt political tactics, similar to those of Richard Nixon. The latest scandals, including the WikiLeaks revelations and the FBI investigation, show Clinton's disregard for U.S. intelligence law and her foundation's pay-for-play profiteering. The article draws parallels between Clinton's campaign and Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, highlighting the similarities in their cynical and corrupt tactics. Both campaigns used quid pro quo and pay-for-play strategies, and both had a ruthless attitude towards opponents. The article also notes that Clinton's aides have no moral compass, and that her positions on key issues are based on political self-interest. The author questions whether Clinton's hubris will be held accountable, given the lack of investigative reporting and the media's support for her campaign.
