SUMMARY:

The article compares Hillary Clinton's campaign to Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, citing similarities in their ruthless and cynical tactics. Both campaigns were accused of using pay-for-play schemes, with Clinton's campaign leveraging the State Department for donations and Nixon's campaign squeezing corporations and wealthy individuals. The article also highlights the similarities between Clinton's aides and Nixon's team, including their lack of moral compass and willingness to engage in dirty tricks. The article suggests that Clinton's campaign has trumped Nixon's in terms of skullduggery, but without the offset of Nixon's foreign-policy accomplishments. The article concludes by questioning whether Clinton's hubris will eventually lead to a Nixonian downfall, but notes that the lack of independent journalism may prevent this from happening.
