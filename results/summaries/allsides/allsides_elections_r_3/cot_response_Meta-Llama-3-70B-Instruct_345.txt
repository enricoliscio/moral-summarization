SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton's campaign has been exposed as ruthless and sloppy, with a playbook similar to Richard Nixon's. The latest scandal involves disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop, suggesting Clinton's careless attitude towards U.S. intelligence law. WikiLeaks has revealed evidence of the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play profiteering, with Clinton's aides having no moral compass. The campaign has been likened to Nixon's, with a ruthless attitude towards opponents and a willingness to engage in dirty tricks. Clinton's consultants have been caught lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and aides have bartered with plutocrats for face time with the Secretary of State. The campaign's tactics have been dubbed "Nixonian to the core," with Clinton's positions on key issues hinging on political self-interest. END OF SUMMARY.
