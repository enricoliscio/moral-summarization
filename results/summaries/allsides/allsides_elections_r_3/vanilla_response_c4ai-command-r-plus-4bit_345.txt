SUMMARY: The latest revelations from the WikiLeaks email leaks and the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server suggest that she has been engaging in similar unethical and illegal activities as former President Richard Nixon. Clinton's campaign has been compared to Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972, with both campaigns marked by scandal, dirty tricks, and a disregard for the law. Emails reveal that Clinton's consultants have no moral compass, and that her positions on issues such as fracking, trade deals, and foreign policy are driven by political self-interest. Like Nixon, Clinton has attacked the messenger and resorted to stonewalling, claiming she could not remember key details about the email scandal. Aides have engaged in shady activities, such as disrupting Trump rallies and accepting donations in exchange for favors. The media's lack of investigative journalism and support for Clinton may prevent her from facing the same consequences as Nixon, who resigned in disgrace.
END OF SUMMARY.
