SUMMARY: Another day, another Hillary Clinton bombshell disclosure. The disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop reveals Clinton’s carelessness with U.S. intelligence law. WikiLeaks exposes evidence of the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play profiteering. Clinton has outdone former president Richard Nixon’s skullduggery without his foreign-policy accomplishments. Clinton’s campaign mirrors Nixon’s playbook: squeezing donations, cynicism, and a quid pro quo mentality. The WikiLeaks/Podesta emails show a lack of moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics. Clinton’s thugs provoked violence at Trump rallies and brought illegal voters. Hacked emails reveal Clinton’s flexible positions to serve self-interest. Clinton lied about her email server, the Clinton Foundation’s pay-for-play schemes, and the Benghazi killings. She attacked the FBI director, James Comey, and resorted to stonewalling. Abedin's emails reveal Clinton's request to accept $12 million for a speech, indicative of “Bill Clinton Inc.” Nixon covered up misdeeds, but eventually resigned amid impeachment. Will Clinton meet a similar fate? The media's backing of Clinton may prevent independent journalism from exposing her hubris before the election.
END OF SUMMARY.
