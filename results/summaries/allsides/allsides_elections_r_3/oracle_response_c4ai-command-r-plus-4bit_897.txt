SUMMARY: Another day, another bombshell disclosure about Hillary Clinton's scandalous behavior. WikiLeaks reveals the Clinton Foundation's leveraging of the State Department for pay-for-play profiteering, while Anthony Weiner's laptop exposes Clinton's carelessness with U.S. intelligence law. Clinton's campaign tactics mirror those of Richard Nixon, from squeezing corporations for donations to staging disruptions at opponent rallies. Clinton's aides have no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics in emails, while Clinton herself accepts speaking fees and donations in exchange for favors. Clinton's lies and cover-ups about her email server and the Benghazi killings echo Nixon's deceptions and stonewalling. The media's failure to investigate and their backing of Clinton may prevent her from facing a Nixonian comeuppance. Will an elected President Clinton eventually meet the same fate as Nixon, or will her hubris go unpunished?
END OF SUMMARY.
