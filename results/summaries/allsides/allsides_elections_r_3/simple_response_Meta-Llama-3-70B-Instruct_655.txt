SUMMARY:

The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless political tactics, likening her to Richard Nixon's playbook. Clinton's campaign has been plagued by scandals, including the use of her State Department for pay-for-play profiteering and a sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law. WikiLeaks has revealed a trail of evidence, including emails that show Clinton's consultants have no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and bartering with plutocrats for face time. The article draws parallels between Clinton's campaign and Nixon's, including the use of dirty tricks, stonewalling, and attacking the messenger. Clinton's aides have been caught trying to disrupt Trump rallies and engaging in illegal activities. The article questions whether Clinton's hubris will be held accountable, given the lack of investigative reporting and media bias.
