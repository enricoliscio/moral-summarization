SUMMARY:

The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless politics, likening her to Richard Nixon's playbook. Clinton's campaign has been marred by scandals, including pay-for-play profiteering, sloppy handling of U.S. intelligence law, and a "flexibility" on issues. The WikiLeaks/Podesta email trove reveals a lack of moral compass among Clinton's consultants, who have lampooned Latinos and Catholics, and bartered with plutocrats for face time with Secretary of State Clinton. The article draws parallels between Clinton's tactics and Nixon's, including the use of "plumbers" to disrupt rallies and the stonewalling of investigations. Clinton's aides, including John Podesta, Cheryl Mills, and Huma Abedin, are accused of aiding and abetting Clinton's knavery and profiteering. The article questions whether Clinton's hubris will ever be held accountable, given the lack of investigative reporting and the media's backing of her campaign.
