SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton's campaign has been embroiled in scandals, with recent disclosures revealing a ruthless politician. The latest scandal involves Anthony Weiner's laptop, suggesting Clinton's careless attitude towards U.S. intelligence law. WikiLeaks also revealed evidence of the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play schemes while Clinton was Secretary of State. Clinton's campaign tactics bear resemblance to Richard Nixon's reelection playbook, with both campaigns relying on large donations and employing questionable strategies. Emails reveal Clinton's flexible morals and self-serving political interests. Clinton's aides have been implicated in the WikiLeaks scandal and it is unlikely they will have a political future. Clinton has consistently lied about her email server and the Benghazi incident, similar to Nixon's cover-ups. Clinton's campaign has also been linked to voter fraud and disruptions at Trump rallies. A Clinton family advisor described their shakedown efforts as "Bill Clinton Inc." Despite the similarities, Clinton may not face the same consequences as Nixon due to a lack of investigative journalism and media bias in her favor.
END OF SUMMARY.
