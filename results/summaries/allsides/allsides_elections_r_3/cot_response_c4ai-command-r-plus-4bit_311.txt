SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton's campaign has been marred by scandals and moral transgressions, drawing comparisons to Richard Nixon's infamous presidency. Clinton's team, led by the ruthless John Podesta, has been exposed for their amoral and cynical tactics, including lampooning Latinos and Catholics, engaging in quid pro quo and pay-for-play schemes, and provoking violence at Trump rallies. Clinton's flexible positions on key issues and her involvement in the email scandal and Benghazi debacle further highlight her dishonesty and lack of a moral compass. Even her aides, such as Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, are complicit in her knavery and profiteering. Clinton's attempts to discredit the FBI director, James Comey, and her stonewalling during the investigation echo Nixon's tactics of attacking the messenger and covering up misdeeds. The media's failure to independently investigate Clinton's transgressions raises concerns about the truth ever coming to light. END OF SUMMARY.
