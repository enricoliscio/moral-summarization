SUMMARY: Another day, another Hillary Clinton bombshell disclosure. WikiLeaks reveals more evidence of Clinton Foundation profiteering and pay-for-play schemes, while Anthony Weiner's laptop exposes Clinton's carelessness with U.S. intelligence law. Clinton's campaign mirrors Nixon's playbook, with both campaigns squeezing corporations and individuals for donations and employing ruthless tactics. Clinton's consultants have no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics. WikiLeaks exposes how Clinton's aides bartered with plutocrats for access to Clinton in exchange for cash donations. Clinton's for-hire thugs have been caught on tape provoking violence at Trump rallies and organizing illegal voting. Hacked emails reveal Clinton's flexible positions on various issues, hinging on her political self-interest. Clinton has lied and stonewalled about her email server, the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play schemes, and the Benghazi killings. She has attacked the messenger, just like Nixon, and resorted to the same defense for her subordinates' shady activities. Clinton and her aides have also been implicated in potential shakedowns and accepting questionable speaking fees. The question remains: will Clinton face a Nixonian comeuppance for her hubris, or will the death of independent journalism allow her to escape scrutiny?
END OF SUMMARY.
