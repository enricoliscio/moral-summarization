SUMMARY: Another day, another bombshell disclosure about Hillary Clinton's scandalous behavior. WikiLeaks reveals Clinton's consultants have no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and engaging in pay-for-play profiteering. Clinton's campaign, under the ruthless John Podesta, follows a Nixonian playbook, with tactics including staged disruptions at Trump rallies and provoking violence. Hacked emails show Clinton's positions are flexible, hinging on her political self-interest. Clinton has lied and stonewalled about her email server and the Benghazi killings, resembling Nixon's cover-ups. Aides have engaged in shady activities, such as accepting $12 million for a speech at the request of Clinton, and "Bill Clinton Inc." has reaped millions through questionable means. The media's lack of investigative journalism may allow Clinton's hubris to go unpunished, at least until after the election.

END OF SUMMARY.
