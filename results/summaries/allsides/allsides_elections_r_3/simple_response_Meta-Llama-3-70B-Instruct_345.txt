SUMMARY:

The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless political tactics, similar to those of Richard Nixon. Clinton's campaign has been plagued by scandals, including the use of Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks revelations of pay-for-play profiteering through the Clinton Foundation. The article draws parallels between Clinton's campaign and Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, including the use of corporate donations and quid pro quo arrangements. Clinton's aides have been shown to have no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and bartering for face time with Secretary of State Clinton in exchange for cash donations. The article suggests that Clinton's actions are even more egregious than Nixon's, with no offsetting foreign-policy accomplishments. The author questions whether Clinton's aides will face consequences for their actions and whether the lack of investigative reporting will allow Clinton's hubris to go unchecked.
