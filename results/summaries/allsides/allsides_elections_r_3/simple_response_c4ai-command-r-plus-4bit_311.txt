SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton's campaign has been marred by scandals and unethical behavior, resembling former President Richard Nixon's playbook. Emails leaked by WikiLeaks reveal a pay-for-play scheme within the Clinton Foundation and a lack of moral compass among her consultants. Clinton's team has disrupted Trump rallies and used violent tactics, echoing Nixon's "plumbers" who staged break-ins. Clinton's positions shift according to her political interests, and her aides have enabled her profiteering. Like Nixon, Clinton attacks messengers and resorts to stonewalling when faced with scrutiny. Despite evidence of wrongdoing, Clinton continues to deny any wrongdoing and the media seems less inclined to investigate her actions. One wonders if Clinton will face a similar fate as Nixon, who resigned in disgrace, and if independent journalism is dead.
END OF SUMMARY.
