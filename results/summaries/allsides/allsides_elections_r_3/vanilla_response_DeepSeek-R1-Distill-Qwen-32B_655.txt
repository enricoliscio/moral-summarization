Okay, so I need to summarize this article about Hillary Clinton and compare her to Nixon. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY.".

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It talks about Clinton being exposed as ruthless, similar to Nixon, using tactics like pay-for-play and quid pro quo. There are references to Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks emails. The article compares her campaign to Nixon's 1972 re-election, mentioning Podesta as the new Haldeman. It also discusses Clinton's dishonesty regarding her email server and the Benghazi incident, and her stonewalling tactics.

I need to condense these points into a summary. I'll mention the comparison to Nixon, the scandals involving Weiner and WikiLeaks, the campaign tactics, Podesta's role, the unethical behavior like bartering for face time, and the media's role in not investigating as much as before. I should also note the potential consequences for Clinton's team and the contrast with Nixon's downfall.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key comparisons and scandals without getting too detailed. I'll structure it to highlight the similarities in tactics, the unethical behavior, and the media's role in not exposing Clinton as much as they did Nixon. I'll make sure to include that Clinton hasn't faced the same downfall yet, possibly due to media support.

Let me put it all together, making sure it flows well and covers all main points succinctly.

SUMMARY: The article compares Hillary Clinton's political tactics to those of Richard Nixon, suggesting she has surpassed Nixon's unethical behavior. Clinton's campaign, under chairman John Podesta, has been accused of pay-for-play schemes, similar to Nixon's "CREEP" operation. WikiLeaks emails reveal Clinton's consultants engaged in unethical practices, including bartering for face time and targeting specific groups. Clinton's dishonesty regarding her email server and the Benghazi incident mirrors Nixon's cover-ups. Like Nixon, Clinton has stonewalled investigators, with Podesta, Cheryl Mills, and Huma Abedin facing potential disgrace. The article questions whether Clinton will face a Nixonian downfall, noting that modern media lacks the investigative rigor of the 1970s, potentially shielding her from accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
