Okay, I need to summarize this news article. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY." 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's comparing Hillary Clinton's political tactics to Richard Nixon's, using information from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks. The key points include Clinton's involvement in pay-for-play schemes, her campaign's resemblance to Nixon's, the use of tactics like provoking violence at rallies, and the comparison of their scandals.

I should highlight the similarities between Clinton and Nixon, such as their campaigns' ruthlessness, the use of donations for influence, and the cover-ups. Also, note the mention of WikiLeaks emails and the comparison of their political strategies.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main comparisons and scandals without getting too detailed. Make sure to include that the article questions whether Clinton will face the same fate as Nixon, considering the media's support for her.

Finally, structure the summary to flow logically, starting with the comparison, detailing the tactics, and ending with the question about her political future.
