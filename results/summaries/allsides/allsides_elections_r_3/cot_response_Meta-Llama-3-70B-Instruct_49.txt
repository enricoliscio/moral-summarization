SUMMARY:
The article exposes Hillary Clinton as a ruthless politician, similar to Richard Nixon, with a playbook of scandals and pay-for-play profiteering. The latest disclosures from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks reveal Clinton's sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law and her campaign's cynical and conniving tactics. The Clinton Foundation is accused of leveraging the State Department for personal gain, and her aides are shown to be morally bankrupt, lampooning Latinos and Catholics. The article draws parallels between Clinton's campaign and Nixon's, with both using dirty tricks and stonewalling to cover up their misdeeds. With the media largely backing Clinton, the article questions whether she will ever face accountability for her actions. END OF SUMMARY.
