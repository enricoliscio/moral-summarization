Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. The user has provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too long. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's comparing Hillary Clinton's actions to Nixon's, highlighting scandals, pay-for-play schemes, and unethical campaign tactics. The author uses strong terms like "ruthless," "scandal," and "profiteering."

I should start by mentioning the comparison between Clinton and Nixon, using terms like "ruthless" and "playbook." Then, I'll note the scandals from Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks, emphasizing "profiteering" and "pay-for-play." 

Next, I'll compare the 2016 campaign to Nixon's 1972 tactics, using words like "nixonian" and "cash machine." Highlight Podesta's ruthlessness and the unethical behavior from the emails, such as lampooning groups and bartering for donations.

I should also mention the comparison of Clinton's campaign tactics to Nixon's, including the ambush tapes and the use of thugs. Include the part about Clinton's positions hinging on self-interest and her stonewalling during the FBI investigation.

Finally, touch on the media's role and whether Clinton will face the same fate as Nixon, using terms like "comeuppance." I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the key moral points and ensure the language reflects the author's framing.

SUMMARY: The article draws a moral comparison between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon, accusing Clinton of engaging in "ruthless" and "nixonian" tactics reminiscent of Nixon's "skullduggery." Clinton is accused of "profiteering" through the Clinton Foundation, leveraging the State Department for "pay-for-play" schemes, and hiding behind "scandals" exposed by WikiLeaks and Anthony Weiner’s laptop. The article highlights Clinton’s campaign as a "cash machine," outspending her opponents, and her team’s unethical behavior, including "lampooning" Latinos, "written off" Catholics, and bartering for donations. Clinton’s aides are accused of having "no moral compass," with Podesta’s ruthlessness and Clinton’s "hinged" positions on key issues for political gain. The article also ties Clinton to "ambush" tactics, provoking violence at Trump rallies, and stonewalling during the FBI investigation, mirroring Nixon’s "cover-up" and "stonewalling." Clinton’s team, including Podesta, Mills, and Abedin, is accused of "aiding and abetting" her "knavery," with no clear political future. The article questions whether Clinton will face a "comeuppance" akin to Nixon’s, given media "backing" and the lack of investigative journalism. END OF SUMMARY.
