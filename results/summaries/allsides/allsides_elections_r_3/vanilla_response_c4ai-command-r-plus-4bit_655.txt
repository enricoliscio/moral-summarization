SUMMARY: The article draws parallels between the political scandals of Hillary Clinton and former President Richard Nixon, suggesting that Clinton's actions mirror Nixon's infamous tactics. Both Clinton and Nixon have been exposed for their ruthless and unethical political strategies, with Clinton's campaign appearing to follow a similar playbook to Nixon's. The article highlights similarities in their campaigns, such as the aggressive fundraising tactics and the use of dirty tricks to discredit opponents. It also points to evidence of Clinton's disregard for intelligence law and the revelation of pay-for-play schemes within the Clinton Foundation. Despite the similarities, the article notes a key difference: Nixon was able to cover up his misdeeds long enough to secure re-election, while Clinton's scandals are being exposed before the 2016 election. The article questions whether Clinton will eventually face a similar fate to Nixon, and whether the lack of independent journalism will allow her to escape consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
