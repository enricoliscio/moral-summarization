SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a ruthless politician with a moral compass akin to that of Richard Nixon. Recent scandals, including the WikiLeaks email disclosures and the revelation of her sloppy attitude towards US intelligence law, suggest a pattern of cynical and conniving behavior. The Clinton campaign, led by the disgraced John Podesta, has been accused of quid pro quo and pay-for-play schemes, with aides bartering Secretary Clinton's face time with plutocrats for cash donations. Clinton's tactics mirror Nixon's anything-goes style, with petty thugs provoking violence and staging break-ins. Emails reveal Clinton's self-interest on fracking, trade deals, and foreign policy. Clinton's aides, including Abedin and Podesta, face disgrace and jail for their role in the knavery and profiteering. Clinton has lied and stonewalled about the email scandal, echoing Nixon's cover-up of the Watergate break-in. Clinton's hubris may escape a Nixonian comeuppance due to a lack of investigative journalism. END OF SUMMARY.
