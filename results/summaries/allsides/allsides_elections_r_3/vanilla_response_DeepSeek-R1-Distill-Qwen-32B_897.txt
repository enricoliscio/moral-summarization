Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article. Let me read through the article first to understand what it's about. The article is comparing Hillary Clinton's political tactics to Richard Nixon's, calling her "Tricky Dick" and suggesting she's using similar underhanded methods. It mentions scandals from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks releases, pointing out Clinton's shady deals and campaign tactics.

I need to condense this into a 200-word summary. I should highlight the main points: the comparison to Nixon, the scandals involving intelligence laws and pay-for-play schemes, the use of tactics like stonewalling and discrediting opponents. Also, the mention of WikiLeaks emails and the comparison between Nixon's and Clinton's campaigns, including their campaign finance practices and unethical behavior.

I should make sure to include that both Nixon and Clinton's associates ended up disgraced, and the article questions if Clinton will face the same downfall, noting the media's role in either exposing or supporting her. The summary should flow logically, covering the key similarities and the implications for Clinton's political future.

I need to be concise, using clear language without getting bogged down in too much detail. Also, since the user provided an example response, I can model my summary similarly, ensuring it's within the word limit and properly formatted with the "SUMMARY:" and "END OF SUMMARY." tokens.

SUMMARY: The article compares Hillary Clinton's political tactics to those of Richard Nixon, dubbing her "Tricky Dick" for her alleged underhanded methods. Scandals from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks reveal Clinton's questionable dealings, including potential violations of U.S. intelligence law and pay-for-play schemes involving the Clinton Foundation. The article draws parallels between Clinton's campaign and Nixon's 1972 re-election effort, highlighting similarities in fundraising tactics, unethical behavior, and the use of dirty tricks. WikiLeaks emails suggest Clinton's aides bartered with donors and mocked certain groups, while Clinton herself allegedly approved lucrative deals, such as a $12 million speaking fee tied to a Moroccan mining company. Both Nixon and Clinton have been accused of stonewalling investigations and discrediting opponents, with Nixon's associates facing disgrace and Clinton's team, including Podesta, Mills, and Abedin, facing similar fates. The article questions whether Clinton, like Nixon, will face political downfall, noting that media support for Clinton may prevent a Nixonian reckoning. END OF SUMMARY.
