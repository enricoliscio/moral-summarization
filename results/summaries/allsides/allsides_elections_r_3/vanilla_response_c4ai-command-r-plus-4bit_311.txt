SUMMARY: Recent scandals surrounding Hillary Clinton's campaign have drawn comparisons to Richard Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972, dubbed CREEP. Both Clinton and Nixon have been exposed for their ruthless and unethical political strategies, including soliciting large donations, staging break-ins, and disrupting opponent rallies. Emails revealed by WikiLeaks show Clinton's flexible positions and self-serving nature, similar to Nixon's willingness to compromise his supposed beliefs. Aides to both politicians have been disgraced or jailed for their involvement in unethical activities. Clinton, like Nixon, has lied and stonewalled about her involvement in scandals, such as the email server controversy and the Benghazi attack. Clinton's campaign has also been exposed for staging violent provocations at Trump rallies and engaging in voter fraud. With the media's support, Clinton may escape the fate of Nixon, who resigned in disgrace due to investigative journalism.
