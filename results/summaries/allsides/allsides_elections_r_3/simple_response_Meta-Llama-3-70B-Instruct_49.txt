SUMMARY:

The article draws parallels between Hillary Clinton's campaign and Richard Nixon's, citing similarities in their ruthless and cynical tactics. Clinton's campaign has been plagued by scandals, including pay-for-play profiteering and a sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law. The article suggests that Clinton has surpassed Nixon's level of skullduggery, but without the offset of Nixon's foreign-policy accomplishments. The WikiLeaks/Podesta email trove reveals a lack of moral compass among Clinton's consultants, who have been involved in questionable activities such as lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and bartering with plutocrats for face time with Secretary of State Clinton. The article concludes that Clinton's hubris may never earn a Nixonian comeuppance, due to the lack of investigative reporting and the media's backing of her campaign.
