SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton's political career is marred by scandals and unethical behavior, resembling former President Richard Nixon's playbook. From the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play schemes to her aides' ruthless tactics, Clinton's campaign has been exposed as morally bankrupt and power-hungry. WikiLeaks revelations show her consultants lampooning Latinos and Catholics, bartering for donations, and tipping off debate questions. Clinton's thugs have disrupted Trump rallies and provoked violence, mirroring Nixon's "plumbers" who staged break-ins. Emails reveal Clinton's flexible positions on key issues, serving her political self-interest. Aides like Podesta, Mills, and Abedin have enabled Clinton's knavery and profiteering, risking their own reputations. Clinton's lies and stonewalling about her email server and Benghazi echo Nixon's cover-ups. With the media's support, Clinton's hubris may go unpunished, but her actions resemble Nixon's, who ultimately faced impeachment. Will Clinton face a similar fate?
END OF SUMMARY.
