Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The article compares Hillary Clinton to Nixon, highlighting unethical campaign tactics, pay-for-play schemes, and dishonesty. I should focus on the key points: Clinton's resemblance to Nixon's tactics, the use of WikiLeaks emails showing unethical behavior, comparison of their campaigns, and the media's role in either exposing or covering up these issues. I need to keep the summary under 200 words and make sure it reflects the author's critical tone towards Clinton. I'll start by outlining the main points, then condense them into a concise summary, ensuring all critical elements are included without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: The article draws parallels between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon, suggesting Clinton's campaign tactics and ethics mirror Nixon's infamous strategies. WikiLeaks revelations and Project Veritas recordings reveal Clinton's team engaged in pay-for-play schemes, targeting vulnerable groups and leveraging donations for political gain. Clinton's consultants displayed a lack of moral compass, akin to Nixon's aides, with tactics like disrupting Trump rallies and using deceitful methods. Both Clinton and Nixon faced accusations of dishonesty, with Clinton stonewalling FBI inquiries and attacking critics, much like Nixon. While Nixon's misdeeds eventually led to his downfall, the article questions if Clinton will face similar consequences, noting media bias may shield her from accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
