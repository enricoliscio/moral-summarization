SUMMARY:

The article compares Hillary Clinton's campaign to Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, highlighting similarities in their ruthless and cynical tactics. Both campaigns used pay-for-play schemes, with Clinton's campaign leveraging the Clinton State Department for donations. The article cites WikiLeaks emails and the FBI investigation, revealing Clinton's sloppy attitude towards US intelligence law and her campaign's lack of moral compass. Clinton's consultants have been caught lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and aides have bartered for face time with Secretary of State Clinton in exchange for cash donations. The article suggests that Clinton's campaign has trumped Nixon's skullduggery, but without the offset of Nixon's foreign-policy accomplishments. The author questions whether Clinton's aides will have a political future, given their involvement in her scandals.
