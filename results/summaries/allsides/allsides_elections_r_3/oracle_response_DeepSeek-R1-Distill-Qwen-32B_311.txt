Okay, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article compares Hillary Clinton's actions to Nixon's, using terms like "ruthless," "scandal," and "pay-for-play." I'll start by identifying the main points: Clinton's scandals from Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks, comparison to Nixon's campaign tactics, unethical behavior in fundraising, and media's role. I'll make sure to include the morally charged words like "scandal," "profiteering," "trumped," and "nixonian." I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and structure it to highlight the moral issues without adding my own opinions. Let me piece this together step by step, ensuring each key point is covered and the moral language is preserved.

SUMMARY: The article draws parallels between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon, accusing Clinton of engaging in unethical and illegal activities reminiscent of Nixon's "Tricky Dick" tactics. Clinton has been implicated in scandals involving the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play schemes, leveraging U.S. intelligence law, and questionable fundraising practices. WikiLeaks disclosures reveal that Clinton's campaign, under chairman John Podesta, exhibited Nixonian ruthlessness, with aides bartering for donations and lampooning vulnerable groups. Clinton's campaign tactics, including provoking violence at Trump rallies and using operatives to disrupt his events, mirror Nixon's dirty tricks. The article highlights Clinton's alleged dishonesty, such as stonewalling FBI investigators and failing to disclose truthful information about her email server and the Benghazi attacks. Nixon's associates faced disgrace, and the article questions whether Clinton's aides, like Podesta, Cheryl Mills, and Huma Abedin, will escape similar fates. Clinton's actions, including accepting payments for speeches tied to U.S. government deals, are described as knavery and profiteering. The article suggests that Clinton's hubris may not face a Nixonian comeuppance due to media bias, but her unethical behavior parallels Nixon's misdeeds. END OF SUMMARY.
