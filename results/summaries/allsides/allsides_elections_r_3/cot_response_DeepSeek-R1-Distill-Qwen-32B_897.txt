Alright, I need to tackle this user's query. They want me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. The task has two parts: first, identify morally framed words, and then write a summary preserving those words.

Looking at the article, it's comparing Hillary Clinton to Nixon, using strong moral terms. I should start by reading through the text to spot words that carry moral judgment. Words like "ruthless," "scandal," "sloppy," "profiteering," "trumped," "skullduggery," "corrupt," "deceit," etc., stand out. I'll list each on a new line with an asterisk.

Next, the summary needs to be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of those moral terms as possible. I'll structure it by highlighting the comparison between Clinton and Nixon, the scandals, unethical tactics, and the media's role. I'll make sure to mention WikiLeaks, Podesta, and the Clinton Foundation's actions to emphasize the moral framing.

I should also note the contrast with Nixon's fate and the media's current support for Clinton, suggesting possible consequences. Keeping it tight and focused on the moral aspects is key here. I'll make sure each point flows logically, maintaining the critical tone of the original article.

**SUMMARY:**  

The article compares Hillary Clinton to Richard Nixon, suggesting her political tactics are similarly ruthless and unethical. Clinton has been accused of violating U.S. intelligence laws and engaging in pay-for-play profiteering through the Clinton Foundation, as revealed by WikiLeaks and Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Her campaign, led by chairman John Podesta, has been described as Nixonian, with aides bartering for Clinton’s face time and lampooning Latinos and Catholics. Clinton’s consultants have shown no moral compass, and her campaign has been accused of provoking violence at Trump rallies and using deceptive tactics, such as bringing in voters by bus to cast illegal ballots. Like Nixon, Clinton has stonewalled investigations, repeatedly claiming she could not remember key details about the email scandal. Her associates, including Podesta, Cheryl Mills, and Huma Abedin, have been implicated in shady activities, raising questions about their political futures. While Nixon faced disgrace and resignation, the article suggests Clinton may avoid a similar fate due to media support, questioning whether independent journalism has died. END OF SUMMARY.
