SUMMARY:
Hillary Clinton's campaign has been exposed as ruthless and sloppy, with a playbook similar to Richard Nixon's. WikiLeaks revelations suggest the Clinton Foundation leveraged the State Department for pay-for-play profiteering, and Clinton's campaign has been accused of knavery and profiteering. Clinton's consultants have no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and bartering with plutocrats for face time. The campaign has also been accused of using thugs to provoke violence at Trump rallies and disrupt the democratic process. Clinton's defense of her actions has been likened to Nixon's stonewalling, and her aides have been accused of shady activities. The question remains whether Clinton's hubris will ultimately lead to her downfall. END OF SUMMARY.
