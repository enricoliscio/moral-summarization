SUMMARY:
The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless and cynical political tactics, reminiscent of Richard Nixon's playbook. The latest WikiLeaks revelations and FBI investigations have uncovered a pattern of pay-for-play profiteering, with the Clinton Foundation leveraging the State Department for personal gain. Clinton's campaign has been accused of lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and her aides have been caught engaging in shady activities, including disrupting Trump rallies and accepting large donations in exchange for face time with the Secretary of State. The article argues that Clinton's actions have surpassed Nixon's skullduggery, but without the offset of Nixon's foreign-policy accomplishments. The media's lack of investigative reporting may ensure that Clinton's hubris goes unpunished, at least until after the election. END OF SUMMARY.
