SUMMARY: Another day, another bombshell disclosure about Hillary Clinton's scandals. WikiLeaks reveals more evidence of Clinton Foundation profiteering and pay-for-play schemes leveraging Clinton's position at the State Department. Clinton's campaign tactics have eerie similarities to Richard Nixon's reelection playbook, dubbed CREEP, with ruthless aides like John Podesta, the new Haldeman. Clinton's consultants show no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics. Thugs hired by Clinton bragged about provoking violence at Trump rallies and illegal voting. Emails reveal Clinton's flexible positions on issues like fracking and trade deals, hinging on political self-interest. Clinton has lied and stonewalled about her email server and the Benghazi killings, just as Nixon lied about Watergate. Will an elected President Clinton face a similar fate to Nixon, or will the death of independent journalism ensure she escapes comeuppance?
END OF SUMMARY.
