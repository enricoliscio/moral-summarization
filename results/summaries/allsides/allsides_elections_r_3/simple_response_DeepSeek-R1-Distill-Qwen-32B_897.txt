Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article compares Hillary Clinton to Richard Nixon, suggesting she's using similar unethical tactics in her campaign. It mentions scandals from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks releases, pointing out Clinton's possible violations of U.S. intelligence laws and pay-for-play schemes. The author draws parallels between Clinton's campaign tactics and Nixon's, like the fundraising methods, the use of a cash machine, and the influence of key aides like Podesta.

The article also talks about Clinton's team manipulating information, such as tipping off debate questions and using operatives to disrupt Trump's rallies. There's a mention of Clinton's aides engaging in unethical behavior, like bartering for face time and her team's lack of a moral compass. The comparison goes into how both Clinton and Nixon lied about their involvement in scandals and how their teams ended up disgraced.

The author questions whether Clinton would face the same downfall as Nixon, considering the media's support for her now compared to the investigative journalism during Nixon's time. They suggest that without such scrutiny, Clinton might avoid accountability.

Now, I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words, keeping the moral judgment intact. I'll focus on the comparisons between Clinton and Nixon, the unethical tactics, scandals, and the critique of media support. I should mention the key points like Weiner's laptop, WikiLeaks, pay-for-play, Nixonian tactics, aides' unethical behavior, Clinton's stonewalling, and the media's role.

I'll structure it to first introduce the comparison, then outline the scandals and unethical practices, followed by the critique of media support and the potential consequences. I'll make sure to highlight the moral framing by emphasizing the unethical and Nixonian tactics.

Let me draft it:

SUMMARY: The article compares Hillary Clinton to Richard Nixon, accusing her of employing unethical, Nixonian tactics in her campaign. Scandals from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks reveal possible violations of U.S. intelligence laws and pay-for-play schemes. Clinton's campaign, led by chairman Podesta, is criticized for ruthless fundraising and manipulating information, such as tipping off debate questions and using operatives to disrupt Trump's rallies. Her team's lack of a moral compass is evident in their unethical behavior, including bartering for face time and stonewalling investigations. The article suggests Clinton's aides, like Podesta, may face disgrace, similar to Nixon's team. The media's support for Clinton is critiqued, questioning if she'll face the same downfall as Nixon without investigative journalism. END OF SUMMARY.

Wait, that's a bit long. Let me trim it down, ensuring it's under 200 words and maintains the moral critique.
