Okay, I need to summarize this article. Let me read through it carefully. The article compares Hillary Clinton's political tactics to those of Richard Nixon, calling her "Tricky Dick" style. It mentions scandals from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks, suggesting Clinton broke U.S. intelligence laws and engaged in pay-for-play schemes. 

The article draws parallels between the 2016 Clinton campaign and Nixon's 1972 re-election, noting similarities in fundraising tactics and unethical behavior. Podesta is likened to Nixon's aides, and WikiLeaks emails reveal Clinton's aides bartering for donations and targeting specific groups. Clinton's team is accused of stonewalling, similar to Nixon, and her campaign is said to use tactics like provoking violence at Trump rallies.

The article also points out that while Nixon's aides faced disgrace, Clinton's team might escape similar fate due to media support. It questions if Clinton would face a Nixon-like downfall, given today's media environment. 

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, highlighting the key points: comparison to Nixon, scandals, unethical tactics, media support, and potential outcomes.
