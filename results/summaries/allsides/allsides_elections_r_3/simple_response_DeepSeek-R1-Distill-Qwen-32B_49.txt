Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is quite detailed, comparing Hillary Clinton to Nixon, highlighting scandals, and discussing the media's role. 

First, I need to understand the main points of the article. It's comparing Clinton's campaign tactics and scandals to Nixon's, focusing on unethical behavior, pay-for-play schemes, and media complicity. The moral framing here is that Clinton is being portrayed as corrupt, similar to Nixon, and the media isn't holding her accountable.

Next, I should identify the key elements to include in the summary: Clinton's unethical practices, comparison to Nixon, WikiLeaks revelations, media's role, and the potential consequences. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure the moral judgment is clear.

I should structure the summary to first introduce the comparison, then detail the unethical actions, mention the media's lack of scrutiny, and conclude with the possible outcomes. I need to ensure that the language reflects the critical tone of the original article.

Now, I'll start drafting the summary, making sure each sentence captures a main point without getting too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay within limits and ensure the moral framing is preserved throughout.

Finally, I'll review the summary to make sure it flows well and accurately represents the article's critical perspective on Clinton's actions and the media's complicity.

SUMMARY: The article draws parallels between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon, suggesting that Clinton's campaign tactics and scandals mirror Nixon's unethical behavior. Clinton is accused of violating U.S. intelligence laws, leveraging the Clinton Foundation for pay-for-play profiteering, and using ruthless campaign strategies reminiscent of Nixon's "plumbers" and dirty tricks. WikiLeaks revelations reveal Clinton's aides bartering with plutocrats, mocking Latinos and Catholics, and engaging in underhanded tactics to influence the election. The article highlights Clinton's stonewalling, lies, and refusal to account for her actions, comparing her to Nixon's pattern of deceit. Unlike Nixon, however, Clinton benefits from media support, which the article suggests may prevent her from facing the same fate as Nixon. The summary underscores the moral failure of Clinton's campaign, her aides, and the complicity of the media in enabling her unethical practices. END OF SUMMARY.
