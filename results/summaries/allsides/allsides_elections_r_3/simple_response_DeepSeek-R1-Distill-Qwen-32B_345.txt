Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the main points.

The article is comparing Hillary Clinton to Richard Nixon, suggesting she's using similar ruthless tactics in her campaign. It mentions scandals from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks, talking about Clinton's campaign leveraging the State Department for pay-for-play. It compares her campaign to Nixon's, pointing out similarities in fundraising, unethical behavior, and cover-ups.

The author uses strong language, calling Clinton's actions "ruthless" and "sloppy" regarding intelligence laws. They also mention that Clinton's campaign, under Podesta, has become Nixonian, with consultants having no moral compass. There are examples of aides bartering for face time, leaking questions, and using tactics like bringing in voters by bus, which are similar to Nixon's dirty tricks.

The article also points out that Nixon's aides were disgraced, and questions if Clinton's aides will face the same fate. It criticizes the media for not investigating Clinton as they did Nixon, suggesting that without independent journalism, Clinton might avoid accountability.

So, the moral framing here is that Clinton's campaign is unethical, comparable to Nixon's, and that the media's failure to investigate properly allows her to escape consequences. The summary needs to capture these points succinctly, within 200 words.

I should structure the summary to first state the comparison between Clinton and Nixon, then outline the specific unethical tactics, mention the role of aides and WikiLeaks, and conclude with the media's role in not holding her accountable. I need to keep the tone critical, highlighting the moral issues without adding my own opinions.

Let me make sure I include key elements: Clinton's unethical campaign tactics, comparison to Nixon, specific examples like pay-for-play, media's failure, and the potential lack of accountability. I should avoid going into too much detail on each point to keep it concise.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements within the word limit.
