Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The article compares Hillary Clinton to Nixon, using terms like "ruthless," "scandal," and "pay-for-play." I need to make sure I include as many of those morally charged words as possible in the summary. The user provided a list of words, so I should check which ones are most impactful and relevant.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about Clinton's scandals from Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks, comparing her campaign tactics to Nixon's. There's mention of unethical practices like pay-for-play, lying about the email server, and attempts to disrupt Trump's rallies.

I need to structure the summary to highlight these moral issues. I'll start by stating that Clinton has been exposed as ruthless, similar to Nixon. Then mention the scandals and WikiLeaks evidence. I'll include terms like "pay-for-play profiteering," "scandals," and "nixonian tactics." I should also touch on her campaign's unethical behavior, such as bartering for face time and lying to the FBI.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words. I'll make sure to include key moral words without making it too wordy. Also, I should end with the question about whether she'll face the same fate as Nixon, referencing the media's role.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring I hit all the main points and include the necessary morally framed words. I'll check the word count to stay within limits. Finally, I'll make sure it starts with "SUMMARY:" and ends with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: The article draws parallels between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon, accusing Clinton of employing "Nixonian" tactics in her campaign. It highlights Clinton's involvement in "pay-for-play profiteering" through the Clinton Foundation and her campaign's unethical practices, such as bartering for face time with plutocrats and lying to the FBI about her email server. WikiLeaks disclosures reveal Clinton's aides lampooning Latinos and Catholics, while her campaign allegedly provoked violence at Trump rallies and sought to disrupt his events. The article compares Clinton's "ruthlessness" to Nixon's "skullduggery," noting her campaign's resemblance to Nixon's CREEP, which engaged in "dirty tricks" and "break-ins." Clinton's aides, like Podesta and Abedin, are accused of aiding and abetting her "knavery," with her campaign resorting to stonewalling and discrediting critics, much like Nixon. The article questions whether Clinton will face a "Nixonian comeuppance" or if the media's backing will shield her from accountability. END OF SUMMARY.
