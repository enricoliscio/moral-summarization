SUMMARY:

The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless politician nature, similar to Richard Nixon's, with a playbook of scandals, pay-for-play profiteering, and skullduggery. The latest bombshell disclosure comes from Anthony Weiner's laptop, revealing Clinton's sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law. WikiLeaks continues to produce evidence of the Clinton Foundation's leveraging of the State Department for personal gain. Clinton's campaign has an eerie resemblance to Nixon's, with a multi-million-dollar cash machine and a ruthless team led by John Podesta, who has no moral compass. The article highlights Clinton's consultants' lampooning of Latinos and Catholics, and their willingness to barter with plutocrats for face time. The author notes that Clinton's positions on key issues hinge on her political self-interest, and her aides have aided and abetted her knavery and profiteering. The article concludes that Clinton's hubris may never earn a Nixonian comeuppance, thanks to the death of independent journalism and the media's backing of her campaign.

END OF SUMMARY.
