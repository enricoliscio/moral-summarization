SUMMARY:

The article exposes Hillary Clinton as a ruthless politician, similar to Richard Nixon, with a playbook of scandals and profiteering. The latest disclosure from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks reveals Clinton's sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law and pay-for-play schemes. The Clinton Foundation leveraged the State Department for personal gain, trumping Nixon's skullduggery without the offset of his foreign-policy accomplishments. The article draws parallels between the 2016 election and the 1972 election, highlighting the similarities between Clinton's campaign and Nixon's CREEP. Both campaigns were marked by a quid pro quo and pay-for-play basis, with aides lampooning minorities and bartering with plutocrats for face time. The article concludes that Clinton's consultants have no moral compass, and her campaign has resorted to Nixonian tactics, including disrupting rallies and provoking violence. The author questions whether Clinton's hubris will ever earn a Nixonian comeuppance, given the lack of investigative reporting and media backing.
