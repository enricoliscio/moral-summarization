SUMMARY:

Hillary Clinton's campaign has been exposed as ruthless and scandal-ridden, with a playbook similar to Richard Nixon's. The latest disclosure from Anthony Weiner's laptop and WikiLeaks reveals Clinton's sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law and pay-for-play profiteering through the Clinton Foundation. Clinton has trumped Nixon's skullduggery, but without the offset of Nixon's foreign-policy accomplishments. The Clinton campaign has been accused of lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and aides have bartered with plutocrats for face time with Secretary of State Clinton in exchange for cash donations. The campaign has also been caught staging break-ins, provoking violence, and disrupting rallies. Clinton's positions on key issues have been revealed to hinge on her political self-interest. The author likens Clinton's tactics to Nixon's, including lying, covering up, and attacking the messenger. The question remains whether Clinton will face a Nixonian comeuppance for her misdeeds.
