SUMMARY:

The article exposes Hillary Clinton's ruthless politician playbook, similar to Richard Nixon's, with a trail of scandals and pay-for-play profiteering. The Clinton Foundation leveraged the State Department for personal gain, and her campaign has been accused of sloppy intelligence law practices. WikiLeaks' disclosures reveal a cynical campaign team with no moral compass, lampooning Latinos and Catholics, and bartering with plutocrats for face time. The article draws parallels between Clinton's tactics and Nixon's, including ambushes, break-ins, and disrupting opponent rallies. Clinton's aides have been caught aiding and abetting her knavery, and she has lied about her email server and the Clinton Foundation's schemes. The article questions whether Clinton will face a Nixonian comeuppance, given the lack of investigative reporting and media backing.

END OF SUMMARY.
