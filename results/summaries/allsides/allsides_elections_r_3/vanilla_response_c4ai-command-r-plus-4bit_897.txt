SUMMARY: The recent scandals surrounding Hillary Clinton's campaign and the WikiLeaks revelations draw parallels to the Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972. Both Clinton and Nixon engaged in unethical and potentially illegal activities, including soliciting large donations, using private email servers, and employing dirty tricks to discredit opponents. Clinton's inner circle, particularly John Podesta, is likened to Nixon's aides, H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, in their ruthless pursuit of power. The author suggests that Clinton's actions may even surpass Nixon's in terms of skullduggery, and questions whether she will face a similar downfall if elected. The role of investigative journalism in exposing these scandals is also highlighted, with concerns raised about the lack of independent media scrutiny of Clinton.
