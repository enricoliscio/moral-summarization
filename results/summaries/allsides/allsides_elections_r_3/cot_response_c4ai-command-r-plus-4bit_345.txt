SUMMARY: Hillary Clinton's campaign has been marred by scandals and moral controversies, drawing comparisons to Richard Nixon's presidency. Emails revealed by WikiLeaks suggest a pay-for-play scheme within the Clinton Foundation and a lack of moral compass among her consultants, who lampooned Latinos and Catholics. Clinton's team, led by the ruthless John Podesta, has been accused of ambushing and provoking violence at Trump rallies, as well as illegal ballot schemes. Clinton herself has been caught in lies and cover-ups, resembling Nixon's tactics of discrediting messengers and resorting to shady activities. Aides like Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills have aided Clinton's knavery, with potential consequences of disgrace, jail, or humiliation. The media's lack of investigative journalism raises concerns about Clinton's hubris going unpunished. END OF SUMMARY.
