SUMMARY:

The article draws parallels between Hillary Clinton's campaign and that of Richard Nixon's in 1972, citing similarities in their ruthless and cynical tactics. Both campaigns were accused of pay-for-play profiteering, with Clinton's campaign leveraging the State Department for donations. The article also highlights Clinton's sloppy attitude towards U.S. intelligence law, as revealed by the Anthony Weiner laptop scandal. WikiLeaks has released emails showing Clinton's consultants to be morally bankrupt, with aides bartering for face time with wealthy donors. The article suggests that Clinton's campaign has no moral compass, with aides lampooning Latinos and Catholics. The article concludes that Clinton's campaign has trumped Nixon's skullduggery, but without the offset of Nixon's foreign-policy accomplishments.

END OF SUMMARY.
