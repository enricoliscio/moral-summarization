Alright, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified to keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points.

The article talks about the discovery of mass graves from the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a significant event in U.S. history that's been largely forgotten. The moral terms used include "massacre," "violence," "assault," "resentment," etc. I need to ensure these words are included in the summary.

I'll start by identifying the key events: the use of ground-penetrating radar, the historical context of the massacre, the destruction of Black Wall Street, the death toll, and the subsequent cover-up. The article also mentions how the event was mislabeled and efforts to erase it from history.

Next, I'll structure the summary to cover these points concisely, using the moral terms where appropriate. I should also mention the ongoing efforts to uncover the truth and the educational impact, like the HBO show and educational changes.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but include all necessary details. I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting from the discovery, moving to the historical context, the cover-up, and ending with current efforts to remember the event.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it includes all the morally framed words without making it too verbose. I'll check that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and maintains the intended moral perspective.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a violent event often referred to as "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history." The massacre occurred in the Greenwood District, a thriving African American neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street," after an unproven accusation of an assault on a white woman by a black man sparked white resentment. On May 31, 1921, white mobs looted, burned, and killed, destroying 35 city blocks and leaving thousands homeless. While the official death toll was 36, historians estimate up to 300 deaths. Despite its scale, the massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase it from history, including mislabeling it as a "riot" and omitting it from educational narratives. Recent discoveries and cultural references, such as the HBO series "Watchmen," have brought renewed attention. Scientists are now examining potential mass grave sites, and local leaders aim to complete excavations by the 2021 centennial. The event highlights a systematic effort to minimize and erase the violence, reflecting broader historical erasure of black progress and systemic racism. END OF SUMMARY.
