SUMMARY:
The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely forgotten and buried. The vibrant Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed by white mobs who looted, burned, and killed residents, leaving thousands homeless and an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. The event was mislabeled as a "riot," blaming black Tulsans and absolving the white mob. A systematic effort to erase the event from history was largely successful, with news accounts cut out and the incident omitted from Oklahoma public schools' curriculum until 2000. The massacre contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America, upending the accepted timeline of racial violence. Scientists have recently discovered evidence of mass graves, and further examination is necessary before excavation. END OF SUMMARY.
