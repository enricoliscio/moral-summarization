SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten part of US history. The massacre occurred when a white woman accused a black man of assault, sparking violence that left thousands homeless and an estimated 36-300 deaths. The event was erased from history, with law enforcement and insurance companies declining to act, and a widespread effort to strip the historical record of evidence. The massacre contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America, and its discovery has sparked debate and renewed interest. A feature film and two TV series are in development, and local leaders hope to excavate the mass grave sites by the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021.
