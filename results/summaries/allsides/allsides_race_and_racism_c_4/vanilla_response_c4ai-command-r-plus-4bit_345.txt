SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists recently discovered possible mass graves connected to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. The massacre, considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history, occurred when white mobs looted, burned, and killed in Tulsa's predominantly black Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street. The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. The massacre has been largely forgotten, partly due to a hesitancy to talk about it and efforts to minimize its impact by referring to it as a "riot." Many Americans only became aware of it this year through its depiction in the HBO series "Watchmen." Further examination and possible excavation of the mass grave sites are planned, and media projects about the massacre are in development. The Tulsa massacre has been mislabeled as a riot, erasing the specific targeting of black success and absolving white perpetrators. It contradicts the popular narrative of black progress and passive victimhood, which may be why it has been overlooked in history.
END OF SUMMARY.
