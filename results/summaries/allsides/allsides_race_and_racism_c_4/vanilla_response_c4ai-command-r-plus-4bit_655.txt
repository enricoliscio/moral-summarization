SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists discovered mass graves connected to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a largely forgotten incident of racial violence in US history. The massacre occurred when white mobs looted, burned, and killed in the predominantly black Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as "Black Wall Street." The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. The massacre has been downplayed and misrepresented for decades, often referred to as a "riot" rather than a targeted attack on black success. Many Americans were unaware of the incident until it was featured in the HBO series "Watchmen." The discovery of possible mass grave sites has sparked renewed interest in the event, with plans for further investigation and media projects to shed light on this tragic chapter of American history.
