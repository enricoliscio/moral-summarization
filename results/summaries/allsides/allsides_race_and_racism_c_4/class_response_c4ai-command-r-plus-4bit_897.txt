SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists recently discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, bringing attention to a buried chapter of US history. The massacre, sparked by an accusation of assault, saw white mobs looting, burning, and killing in Tulsa's Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street. Despite the scale of the incident, with hundreds potentially killed, it has been largely forgotten or omitted from history, mislabeled as a riot. This systematic effort to erase the event from memory succeeded for decades, minimizing its true impact. Many Americans first learned about it this year through popular culture, underscoring how the accepted narrative of black progress in America often overlooks such incidents of extreme violence and targeting of black success. Further examination of possible mass grave sites is underway, with local leaders hoping to complete the project by the 100th anniversary of the massacre in 2021.
END OF SUMMARY.
