SUMMARY:

The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely forgotten and buried. The event, in which a white mob attacked and destroyed the thriving black neighborhood of Greenwood, known as "Black Wall Street," resulted in the deaths of up to 300 people and left thousands homeless. The massacre was sparked by an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman, and was followed by a systematic effort to erase the event from history. The incident was mislabeled as a "riot," and the historical record was stripped of evidence, omitting it from the narrative of black progress in America. The discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar has brought new attention to the event, and efforts are underway to excavate the sites and develop feature films and TV series about the massacre. The moral imperative is clear: it is time to confront and acknowledge this dark chapter in American history.
