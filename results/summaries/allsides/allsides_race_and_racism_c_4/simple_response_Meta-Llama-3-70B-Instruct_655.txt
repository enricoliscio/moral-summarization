SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a brutal event that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, which occurred when a white mob attacked the thriving black neighborhood of Greenwood, known as "Black Wall Street," resulted in the deaths of up to 300 people and left thousands homeless. The event was subsequently erased from history through a systematic effort to destroy evidence, including the removal of news articles and the omission of the incident from school curricula. This erasure has contributed to a distorted narrative of black progress in America, downplaying the role of racial violence and white supremacy. The discovery of the mass graves is a crucial step towards acknowledging and rectifying this dark chapter in American history.
