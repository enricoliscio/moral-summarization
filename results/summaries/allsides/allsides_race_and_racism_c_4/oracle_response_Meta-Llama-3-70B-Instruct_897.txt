SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a devastating event that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, which occurred in the thriving Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was sparked by an unproven accusation of assault against a white woman by a black man, leading to a rampage of looting, burning, and killing by white mobs. The violence left thousands homeless and an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. Despite its scale, the event has been mislabeled as a "riot" and largely omitted from historical records, with a widespread effort to erase it from memory. The discovery of the mass graves is a significant step towards acknowledging the truth and confronting the dark legacy of racial violence in America. END OF SUMMARY.
