SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a devastating event that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, sparked by an unproven accusation of assault, saw white mobs flood into the thriving Greenwood District, looting homes, burning businesses, and killing residents. By June 1, 35 city blocks had been burned to the ground, leaving thousands homeless and an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. The official count was minimized, and the event was mislabeled as a "riot," flipping the narrative to blame black Tulsans and absolve the white mob. A systematic effort to erase the event from history was largely successful, with news accounts cut out and the incident omitted from school curricula. The discovery of the mass graves is a crucial step in uncovering the truth about this rampage and its place in American history.
