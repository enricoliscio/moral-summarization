SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre there using ground-penetrating radar. The Tulsa race massacre, also known as the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," saw white mobs looting homes, burning businesses, and killing residents in the predominantly black Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. Despite the official count of 36 deaths, the actual number could be as high as 300. The massacre has been largely forgotten, with many Americans only becoming aware of it through a recent TV show. The event was long mislabeled as a riot, minimizing the targeted nature of the attack and absolving the white mob of blame. A systematic effort to erase the massacre from history included removing news accounts from records and omitting it from school curricula. The incident contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America and showcases the specific targeting of black success. Further examination of possible mass grave sites is needed before excavation, and local leaders hope to complete the project by the 100th anniversary in 2021.
