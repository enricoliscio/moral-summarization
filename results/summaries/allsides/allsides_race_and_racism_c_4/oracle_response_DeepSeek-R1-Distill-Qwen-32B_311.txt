Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article talks about the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, which was a tragic event. The author uses strong moral words like "massacre," "violence," "looting," "burning," and "killing." I should make sure to include these terms in the summary to maintain the tone.

The article explains that the Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, was destroyed. It mentions the false accusation leading to violence, the destruction of 35 blocks, and the high death toll, possibly up to 300. The event was underreported and mislabeled as a riot, which downplays the severity. There's also an effort to erase this history, which is a moral issue.

I should mention the recent discovery of mass graves and the plans for further investigation. The summary should highlight the historical erasure and the impact on the community. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and use the specified moral words to convey the gravity of the situation.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a tragic event often referred to as "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history." The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs, fueled by resentment and a false accusation of assault, looted, burned, and killed residents. Over 35 blocks were burned, leaving thousands homeless, with at least 36 deaths and possibly up to 300. The massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase its history, including mislabeling it as a "riot" to minimize its impact. Recent discoveries and cultural projects aim to shed light on this forgotten chapter, highlighting the systematic targeting of black success and the whitewashing of American history. The potential excavation of mass graves and ongoing efforts to acknowledge the victims underscore the need to confront this dark past. END OF SUMMARY.
