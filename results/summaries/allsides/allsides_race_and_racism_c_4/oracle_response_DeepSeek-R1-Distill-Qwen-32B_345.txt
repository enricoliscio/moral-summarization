Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read the article first. It's about the Tulsa race massacre of 1921, where scientists found mass graves using radar. The article details the violence, the historical erasure, and the ongoing efforts to uncover the truth.

I need to make sure I include as many of the morally charged words as possible. Words like "massacre," "violence," "looting," "killing," "deaths," " Forgotten," " sanitized," etc. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

I should structure it to highlight the discovery, the historical context, the violence, the erasure, and the current efforts. Also, mention the media projects that are bringing attention to it. I need to keep the moral tone by using words that convey the severity and injustice of the event.

Let me draft it: Start with the discovery, mention the historical significance, describe the violence, talk about the erasure and why it's important, and end with the current efforts and media projects. Make sure to include the key morally framed words without making it too long.

I think that covers all the points. Now, let me put it together in a coherent way, keeping it under 200 words.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Okla., have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a devastating event often referred to as "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history." The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs attacked, looting, burning, and killing residents. The official death toll was 36, but historians estimate up to 300 deaths. Despite its scale, the massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase its history through mislabeling it as a "riot" and omitting it from textbooks. The event challenges the narrative of black progress in America, highlighting systematic violence and erasure. Recent discoveries and media projects, including a feature film and TV series, aim to shed light on this forgotten tragedy. The excavation of potential mass graves and DNA testing could provide answers for descendants of victims. The massacre remains a stark reminder of racial violence and the need to confront America's history. END OF SUMMARY.
