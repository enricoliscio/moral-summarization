Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally charged words that the author used, so I should make sure to include as many of those as possible in the summary. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. It's about the discovery of mass graves from the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, which was a horrific event where a black neighborhood was destroyed. The article mentions that the event was largely forgotten and how it's now being remembered.

I need to highlight the moral aspects, like the violence, the targeting, the cover-up, and the historical erasure. Words like "massacre," "violence," "buried," "looting," "burning," "killing," "forgotten," "attack," "effort," "strip," "riot," "minimized," "rampage," "omitted," "mislabeled," "targeting," "flipping," "blamed," "absolved," "bombing," "sanitized," "erase," "tossed," "unmarked," "cut," "upends," "scrambles" are important to include.

I should structure the summary to cover the discovery, the historical context of the massacre, the reasons it was forgotten, and the current efforts to remember it. I'll make sure each of these points uses the morally framed words appropriately.

I also need to keep the summary under 200 words and end it properly with the tokens. Let me draft it, making sure to include the key points and the moral language.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, used ground-penetrating radar to uncover evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a violent event that has been largely buried in history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs looted, burned, and killed residents following an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman. The official death toll was 36, but historians estimate up to 300 deaths. The massacre has been forgotten due to a systematic effort to erase its history, including mislabeling it as a "riot" to minimize its impact. For decades, the event was omitted from textbooks and public discourse, with many Americans only becoming aware of it recently through media like the HBO series "Watchmen." Local leaders aim to excavate and identify remains by the 100th anniversary in 2021, while new media projects seek to bring the massacre to light. The discovery challenges the sanitized narrative of American history, highlighting the targeting of black success and the need to confront the violence and racism that shaped the nation. END OF SUMMARY.
