SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves related to the 1921 race massacre there, bringing attention to a largely forgotten incident of racial violence in American history. The Tulsa race massacre, also known as the Tulsa race riot, saw white mobs looting, burning, and killing in the predominantly black Greenwood District, leaving thousands homeless and resulting in an unknown number of deaths, possibly as high as 300. The massacre, sparked by an unproven accusation of assault, has been downplayed and omitted from history, with efforts made to strip the event of its true impact and erase it from the historical record. Many Americans were unaware of the massacre until it was featured in the HBO series "Watchmen." The discovery of possible mass grave sites has renewed interest in the event, with plans for further investigation and media projects to shed light on this tragic chapter of American history. The Tulsa race massacre highlights the systematic targeting and violence inflicted on black success, contradicting the popular narrative of black progress in America and underscoring the need for a more accurate and inclusive historical account.
