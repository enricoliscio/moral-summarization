SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, bringing to light a buried history of what's been called "the single worst incident of racial violence in America." The Greenwood District of Tulsa, once a thriving black neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street," was devastated on May 31, 1921, by an accusation of assault against a white woman by a black man. White mobs looted, burned, and killed, leaving thousands homeless and a devastating death toll that may have reached 300. The Tulsa massacre has been largely forgotten, with many Americans only learning of it recently through pop culture references. The event was long mislabeled as a riot, minimizing the targeted violence and absolving the perpetrators. Efforts to erase the massacre from history, including stripping references from news accounts, have been largely successful. However, with new evidence emerging and increased awareness, the true impact of this tragic incident is finally being recognized.
