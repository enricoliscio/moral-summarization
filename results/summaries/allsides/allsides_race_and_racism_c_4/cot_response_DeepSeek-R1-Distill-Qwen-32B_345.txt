Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user wants me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. They provided a news article about the Tulsa race massacre and specific instructions on how to summarize it.

First, I need to understand the structure of the query. They mentioned two main steps: identifying morally framed words and then writing a summary that preserves those moral frames. The user also provided an example response, so I can refer to that for guidance.

Looking at the article, I should read through it carefully to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "buried," "vibrant," "success," "assault," "violence," "massacre," "forgotten," "hesitant," "hush-hush," "euphemism," "minimized," "erased," "absolved," "whitewashed," "sanitized," "passive," "dogma," "scrambles," "timeline," and "forget" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, I need to summarize the article while keeping these words intact. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and include the key points: the discovery of mass graves, the historical context of the massacre, the reasons for its obscurity, and ongoing efforts to remember it.

I should ensure that the moral framing is preserved, highlighting the injustice and the systematic erasure of the event. Mentioning the recent efforts like films and the 100th anniversary adds context about current initiatives to address the historical amnesia.

I also need to structure the response with STEP 1 listing each morally framed word and then the SUMMARY section. The user emphasized using the correct tokens, so I'll make sure to start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY."

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure it's within the word limit and effectively conveys the moral implications without losing the essential details of the article.

**SUMMARY:**  
Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 race massacre, a horrific event often referred to as "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history." The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was a thriving black community until white mobs, driven by false accusations, burned it to the ground, killing hundreds and leaving thousands homeless. Despite its scale, the massacre has been buried in history, with efforts to erase its memory through euphemisms, censorship, and omission from educational curricula. The discovery of potential mass graves highlights the need to confront this forgotten chapter of racial violence. Local leaders aim to complete excavations and identifications by the 100th anniversary in 2021, while new media projects, including films and TV series, seek to bring the massacre to light. The event challenges the narrative of black progress in America, revealing a history of systemic oppression and violence that has long been whitewashed. END OF SUMMARY.
