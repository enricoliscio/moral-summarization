Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Tulsa Race Massacre. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. Let me read through the article again to understand the key points and the moral aspects.

The article starts by talking about scientists discovering mass graves using ground-penetrating radar in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This is related to the 1921 race massacre, which is described as one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history. The Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, was thriving before the massacre. The violence was triggered by a false accusation, leading to destruction, deaths, and the event being downplayed or forgotten.

The moral framing here emphasizes the systemic erasure of this event. The article mentions how the massacre was labeled a "riot," which downplays the violence and shifts blame. It also discusses how the event was omitted from history, not taught in schools, and only recently brought to light through media like the HBO show "Watchmen." The discovery of mass graves is a call to remember and confront this history, highlighting the ongoing struggle for justice and recognition.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: the discovery, the historical context, the moral issues of erasure and labeling, and the implications for today. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it captures the moral perspective of the original article.

Let me structure it: start with the discovery, explain the massacre's significance, mention the cover-up and historical erasure, and conclude with the current efforts to remember and address the past. I'll need to use clear and concise language while preserving the moral tone about the need to acknowledge this dark history.

I should also include the numbers, like the death toll and the duration until it was taught in schools, to emphasize the scale and the deliberate forgetting. Highlighting the media's role in bringing it to light is important too, showing how awareness is growing now.

Now, putting it all together in a summary that's within the word limit and maintains the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, a devastating event often called the worst incident of racial violence in U.S. history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was thriving before white mobs destroyed it, killing hundreds and leaving thousands homeless. The official death toll was 36, but historians estimate up to 300 deaths. The massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase it from history, including labeling it a "riot" to minimize its impact. For decades, it was omitted from school curricula and historical records. The discovery of the graves highlights the need to confront this buried past. Plans to excavate and identify remains are underway, with hopes to complete the project by the 100th anniversary in 2021. The massacre challenges the narrative of black progress in America, revealing a history of systemic violence and erasure. END OF SUMMARY.
