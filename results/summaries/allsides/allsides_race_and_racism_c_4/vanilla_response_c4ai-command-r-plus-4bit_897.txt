SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. The massacre, considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history, occurred when white mobs looted, burned, and killed in Tulsa's predominantly black Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street. The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. Despite the scale of violence, the Tulsa massacre has been largely forgotten, with many Americans only becoming aware of it this year through popular culture. The event was long hidden due to a lack of discussion, a lack of official records, and a deliberate effort to erase it from history. It has also been mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing the targeted nature of the attack. The discovery of possible mass grave sites has renewed interest in the massacre, with plans for further investigation and media projects aiming to shed light on this forgotten chapter of American history.

END OF SUMMARY.
