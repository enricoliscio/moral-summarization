SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten event in US history. The massacre occurred when white mobs attacked the Greenwood District, a vibrant black neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street," after an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman. The violence left thousands homeless and an estimated 36-300 deaths. The event was largely unknown due to a lack of documentation, a widespread effort to erase it from history, and a reluctance to discuss it. Historians believe the incident was one of several racial violence events omitted from the historical record. Further examination of the mass grave sites is needed, and local leaders hope to complete the project by the 100th anniversary in 2021. The event is gaining more attention, with a feature film and two TV series in development.
