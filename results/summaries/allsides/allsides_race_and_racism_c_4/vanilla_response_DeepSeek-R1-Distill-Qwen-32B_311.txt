Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Tulsa race massacre. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how scientists found evidence of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar. It mentions the Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street, which was destroyed in 1921. The event is considered one of the worst racial violence incidents in US history.

I should note the key points: the discovery of mass graves, the historical background of the massacre, the death toll estimates, why the event was forgotten, and what's happening now with the investigation and media projects. Also, the perspectives on why it was downplayed as a riot instead of a massacre.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the discovery, then provide context about the massacre, the death count, and why it's been overlooked. Then mention the efforts to uncover the truth and the media projects. Finally, include the perspectives on the event being labeled a riot and its historical erasure.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, covering each main point without getting too detailed. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre using ground-penetrating radar. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs attacked, burning 35 blocks and killing an estimated 300 people, though official records only noted 36 deaths. The event, often referred to as a "riot," has been largely overlooked in U.S. history due to efforts to suppress its details. Local leaders aim to complete investigations by the 100th anniversary in 2021, and media projects, including a film and TV series, are in development. The massacre challenges the narrative of black progress in America, highlighting a period of widespread racial violence often omitted from historical accounts. END OF SUMMARY.
