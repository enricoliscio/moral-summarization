Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Tulsa Race Massacre. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article talks about scientists discovering mass graves in Tulsa using ground-penetrating radar. This is related to the 1921 race massacre, which is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history. The Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, was destroyed. The death toll was officially 36, but estimates go up to 300. The event has been largely forgotten, even being referred to as a riot, which downplays the violence. Efforts to erase it from history were successful, including removing news accounts and not teaching it in schools until 2000. There are plans to excavate the graves and develop media projects about it.

Now, the moral framing here is about historical erasure and systemic racism. The author is highlighting how the massacre was minimized and forgotten, which reflects broader issues of racism and the suppression of black history. I need to make sure the summary captures this moral perspective.

I should start by mentioning the discovery of the mass graves and the historical context of the massacre. Then, discuss how it's been forgotten and the reasons behind thatâ€”like the use of "riot" instead of massacre, the erasure from records, and educational materials. Finally, touch on the efforts to uncover the truth and the implications of this historical amnesia.

I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and ensure it's clear and preserves the moral angle. Let me structure it: discovery, historical context, reasons for obscurity, and current efforts. That should cover the main points and the moral framing.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, a devastating event often overlooked in U.S. history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs attacked, burning over 35 city blocks, killing up to 300 people, and leaving thousands homeless. The massacre, initially labeled a "riot," has been downplayed and erased from historical records, with efforts to minimize its impact and suppress its memory. For decades, the event was excluded from educational curricula and media narratives, reflecting a broader trend of omitting racial violence from the preferred story of black progress in America. The recent discovery of mass graves highlights the need to confront this dark history, with plans for further investigation and excavation. Local leaders aim to honor the victims by completing the project by the 100th anniversary in 2021, while media projects, including a feature film and TV series, seek to bring the massacre to a wider audience. The Tulsa Race Massacre serves as a stark reminder of the systemic erasure of racial violence and the enduring struggle for justice and truth. END OF SUMMARY.
