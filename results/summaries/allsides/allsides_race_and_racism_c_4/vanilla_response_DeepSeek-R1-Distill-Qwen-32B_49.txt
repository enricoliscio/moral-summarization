Okay, I need to summarize this article about the Tulsa Race Massacre. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how scientists found evidence of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar. The massacre happened in 1921, and it's considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in the US. The Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, was destroyed. The death toll was officially 36, but now they think it might be up to 300. 

The article also mentions that this event is not well-known, partly because people in Tulsa didn't talk about it and there's been an effort to erase it from history. It was often referred to as a riot, which downplays the violence. Now, there's a push to excavate the graves and find out more. Also, there are media projects in the works to bring attention to the massacre.

I should make sure the summary includes the key points: the discovery of mass graves, the historical context of the massacre, why it's been forgotten, and what's happening now. I need to keep it under 200 words and make it concise. I'll start by stating the discovery, then the history of the massacre, the reasons for its obscurity, and the current efforts to address it. I'll also mention the media projects as they show the growing awareness. 

Let me structure it: Discovery of graves, background on the massacre, reasons for it being forgotten, and current initiatives. I'll make sure each sentence is clear and to the point without unnecessary details. Also, I'll use the required tokens at the beginning and end.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, a devastating event often overlooked in U.S. history. The massacre, triggered by false accusations, saw white mobs destroy the thriving Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," leaving 35 blocks in ruins and up to 300 dead. Despite its scale, the massacre has been largely forgotten due to efforts to erase its history, including labeling it a "riot" and omitting it from educational curricula. Recent discoveries and media projects, such as an upcoming feature film and TV series, aim to bring attention to this tragic event. Excavation of potential mass graves is planned, with DNA testing to identify victims, in time for the 100th anniversary in 2021. END OF SUMMARY.
