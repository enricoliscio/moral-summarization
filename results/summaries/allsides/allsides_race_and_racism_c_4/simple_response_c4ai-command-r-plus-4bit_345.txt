SUMMARY: Using ground-penending radar, scientists uncovered evidence of mass graves related to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, bringing attention to a long-buried chapter of American history. The massacre, sparked by false accusations of assault, resulted in the destruction of the prosperous Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street. Despite the devastating impact and loss of life, the event has been largely overlooked, attributed to a reluctance to confront the true extent of racial violence and a systematic effort to erase it from historical records. The mislabeling of the massacre as a "riot" minimized the targeted nature of the attack and shifted blame to the black community. The incident challenges the narrative of black progress and reveals a more complex and disturbing reality of racial tensions in America. With ongoing efforts to uncover the truth through excavations and media projects, there is a renewed focus on ensuring this tragic event is remembered and its lessons learned.
