Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified to use as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, where a vibrant black neighborhood was destroyed. Scientists found evidence of mass graves using radar. The event was a significant act of racial violence but has been forgotten and downplayed.

I should highlight the moral aspects: the massacre, violence, targeting, and the suppression of history. I'll need to include terms like "massacre," "violence," "buried," "accusation," "flooded," "looting," "burning," "killing," "deaths," "forgotten," "attack," "effort," "strip," "riot," "minimized," "rampage," "omitted," "mislabeled," "targeting," "flipping," "blamed," "absolved," "bombing," "sanitized," "erase," "tossed," "unmarked," "cut," "happened," "upends," "scrambles."

I'll structure the summary to first explain the discovery, then the historical context of the massacre, the violence, and the subsequent suppression of the event. I'll also mention the recent attention and ongoing efforts to uncover the truth.

I need to keep it under 200 words. Let me make sure to include the key points: the discovery, the scale of violence, the cover-up, the renaming as a riot, the omission from history, and the current efforts to remember and document the event.

I should also mention the impact on the narrative of black progress and how this event contradicts that. Including the media projects in development adds context on how it's being remembered now.

Now, putting it all together concisely while preserving the moral language. I'll ensure each sentence flows logically, covering the discovery, the event, its suppression, and current efforts.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, used ground-penetrating radar to uncover evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a tragic event often referred to as "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history." The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs, fueled by an unproven accusation, looted, burned, and killed, leaving 35 blocks in ruins and thousands homeless. While the official death toll was 36, historians estimate up to 300 deaths. Despite its scale, the massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase its history, including renaming it a "riot" to minimize its impact. For decades, the event was omitted from public records and education, only recently gaining attention through media like the HBO series "Watchmen." Local leaders aim to excavate and identify remains by 2021, the centennial of the massacre. The discovery challenges the sanitized narrative of American progress, highlighting a brutal attack on black success and the systematic erasure of racial violence. END OF SUMMARY.
