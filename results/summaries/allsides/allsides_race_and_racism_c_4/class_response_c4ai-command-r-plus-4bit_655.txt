SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the Tulsa race massacre of 1921, bringing to light a buried history of what's been called "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history." The prosperous Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as "Black Wall Street," was looted and burned to the ground by a white mob, resulting in thousands of black Tulsans being left homeless and hundreds of deaths. Despite the scale of the attack, the incident has been largely forgotten and omitted from history books, with many Americans only becoming aware of it through a recent TV show. The massacre has often been mislabeled as a riot, minimizing the targeted nature of the violence and absolving the perpetrators. A systematic effort to erase the event from history involved hiding evidence and omitting it from educational curricula. As further examination of the possible mass grave sites is conducted, local leaders hope to bring awareness to the true impact of the Tulsa massacre and its place in the narrative of black progress in America.
