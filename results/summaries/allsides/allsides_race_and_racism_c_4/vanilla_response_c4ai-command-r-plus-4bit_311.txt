SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, which was one of the deadliest incidents of racial violence in US history. The massacre took place in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as "Black Wall Street," a successful and vibrant black neighborhood. On May 31, 1921, an accusation of assault by a black man against a white woman sparked a wave of violence as white mobs looted, burned, and killed. The official death toll was 36, but the actual number is believed to be much higher. The massacre has been largely forgotten, in part due to a lack of discussion and a widespread effort to erase it from history. It has often been mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing the targeted nature of the attack. Many Americans only became aware of the incident through its portrayal in the HBO show "Watchmen." Further examination of the mass grave sites is needed before excavation, and local leaders hope to have the project completed by the 100th anniversary in 2021. The Tulsa race massacre reveals a complex and often hidden history of racial violence and progress in America.
