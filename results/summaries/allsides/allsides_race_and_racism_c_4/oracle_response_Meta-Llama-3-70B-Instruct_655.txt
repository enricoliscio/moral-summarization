SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a brutal event that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, which occurred on May 31, 1921, was sparked by an unproven accusation of an assault of a white woman by a black man, leading to a violent rampage by white mobs against the thriving Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street." Homes were looted, businesses burned, and residents killed, leaving thousands homeless and an estimated 36-300 deaths. The official count was minimized, and the event was mislabeled as a "riot," absolving the white mob of responsibility. A systematic effort was made to erase the event from history, with news accounts cut out and the incident omitted from school curricula. The discovery of the mass graves is a crucial step towards acknowledging the truth and bringing justice to the victims of this horrific event. END OF SUMMARY.
