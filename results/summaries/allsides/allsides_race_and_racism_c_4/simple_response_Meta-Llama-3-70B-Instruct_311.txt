SUMMARY:

The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered the single worst incident of racial violence in American history, has been largely forgotten and buried. The event, which saw white mobs loot, burn, and kill in the Greenwood District, a thriving black neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street," resulted in the deaths of up to 300 people and left thousands homeless. The massacre was subsequently erased from history through a systematic effort to destroy evidence, omit it from school curricula, and downplay its significance. This moral amnesia has contributed to a distorted narrative of black progress in America, perpetuating a whitewashed version of history that ignores the brutal reality of racial violence. The recent discovery of mass graves and the development of film and TV projects aim to rectify this historical injustice and bring attention to the atrocities committed. It is imperative that we confront and learn from this painful past to build a more honest and equitable future.
