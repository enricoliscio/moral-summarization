SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered mass graves linked to the 1921 race massacre, bringing to light a buried history of racial violence. The Greenwood District, a thriving black neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street," was attacked by white mobs due to long-standing resentment and an unproven accusation. The massacre resulted in the destruction of 35 city blocks, thousands of homeless people, and an estimated death toll of up to 300 people. Despite the scale of the violence, the Tulsa race massacre has been largely forgotten, with many Americans only becoming aware of it through a recent TV show. This is partly due to a systematic effort to erase the event, mislabeling it as a "riot" and minimizing its impact. The true extent of the massacre challenges the popular narrative of black progress in America, highlighting a history of racial violence and the targeting of black success. Local leaders and scientists are working to excavate and identify the remains, with plans to complete the project by the 100th anniversary of the massacre in 2021.
