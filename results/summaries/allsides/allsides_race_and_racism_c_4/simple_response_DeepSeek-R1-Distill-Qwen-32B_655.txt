Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 and the recent discovery of mass graves. The moral aspects include the historical erasure, systemic racism, and the impact on the community. I should highlight how the event was minimized and forgotten, the systematic efforts to erase it, and the ongoing efforts to uncover and acknowledge the truth. I need to keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure to include the key points: the discovery, the historical context, the reasons for its obscurity, and future plans. Also, I should mention the perspectives that emphasize the moral issues, like the use of "riot" as a euphemism and the whitewashing of history. I need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all these elements without being too detailed.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered potential mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, a violent event that destroyed the thriving Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street." The massacre, triggered by a false accusation, saw white mobs loot, burn, and kill, leaving 35 blocks in ruins and thousands homeless. Official records noted 36 deaths, but historians estimate up to 300 fatalities. Despite its scale, the massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase it from history, including mislabeling it as a "riot" and omitting it from educational curricula. Recent excavations and planned commemorations aim to uncover the truth and honor the victims. The event challenges the narrative of black progress in America, highlighting systemic racism and the whitewashing of history. END OF SUMMARY.
