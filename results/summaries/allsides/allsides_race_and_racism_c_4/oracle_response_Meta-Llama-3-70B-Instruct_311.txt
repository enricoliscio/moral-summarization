SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a dark event in American history that has been largely forgotten. The massacre, sparked by an unproven accusation of assault, saw white mobs loot, burn, and kill in the thriving Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street." The violence left thousands homeless, with estimates suggesting up to 300 deaths. Despite its scale, the incident has been omitted from historical records, with a widespread effort to strip evidence of the event. The term "riot" was used to mislabel the massacre, minimizing its impact and flipping the narrative to blame black Tulsans and absolve the white mob. The discovery of the mass graves is a crucial step in uncovering the truth about this rampage, which contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America. Local leaders hope to complete the project by the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021.
