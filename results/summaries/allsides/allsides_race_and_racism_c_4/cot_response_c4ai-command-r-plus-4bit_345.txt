SUMMARY:
Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre. The massacre, known as the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," left 35 city blocks burned to the ground, thousands homeless, and dozens of victims dead. Despite the deadly nature of the attack, the Tulsa race massacre has been largely forgotten and even erased from history. Many Americans were unaware of the incident until it was featured in the HBO drama "Watchmen." 

The massacre has been mislabeled as a riot, minimizing the true impact of the white mobs' violence and absolving the perpetrators of blame. The event was stripped from the historical record through various means, including tossing the dead into unmarked graves and cutting news accounts from reference volumes. This systematic effort to erase the massacre from history was largely successful, with the incident only recently entering American history textbooks and Oklahoma's public school curriculum. 

The Tulsa race massacre contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America, challenging the accepted timeline of passive black victims and unique white extremist violence. The labeling of the event as a "riot" further perpetuated the minimization of its true impact and the blaming of the black community. 

Local leaders hope to complete the examination and excavation of the mass grave sites by the 100th anniversary of the massacre in 2021. END OF SUMMARY.
