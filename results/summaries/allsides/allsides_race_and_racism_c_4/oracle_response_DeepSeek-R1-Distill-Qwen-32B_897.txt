Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a detailed article about the Tulsa Race Massacre and the recent discovery of mass graves. They also listed specific morally charged words that should be included in the summary.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key elements are the discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar, the historical context of the 1921 massacre, the destruction of the Greenwood District, the underreported death toll, and the efforts to suppress the event's history.

Next, I need to identify the morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "massacre," "violence," "assault," "resentment," "looting," "burning," "killing," "homeless," "deaths," "attack," "effort," "strip," "minimized," "rampage," "omitted," "slavery," "mislabeled," "targeting," "flipping," "blamed," "absolved," "bombing," "whitewashed," "sanitized," "erase," "tossed," "cut," "victims," "churchbombing" are important.

I should ensure that the summary includes these words where appropriate without making it sound forced. The summary should be concise, around 200 words, and structured to highlight the moral aspects of the event and its suppression.

I'll start by introducing the discovery of the mass graves, then provide context about the massacre, its impact, and how the event was minimized or erased from history. I'll also mention ongoing efforts to remember and study the event, including the film projects.

I need to make sure the summary flows well, connecting the historical event with the moral implications of its suppression. I'll avoid technical jargon and keep the language clear and impactful.

Finally, I'll review the summary to ensure all key points are covered and that the morally framed words are appropriately integrated. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, a violent event that has been largely erased from history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs looted, burned, and killed black residents after an unproven assault accusation. The official death toll was 36, but historians estimate up to 300 deaths. The massacre, often mislabeled as a riot, was a targeted attack on black success, leaving thousands homeless. Efforts to minimize its impact included stripping historical records, omitting it from textbooks, and whitewashing American history. The discovery of potential mass graves highlights the need to confront this dark chapter. Local leaders aim to complete investigations by 2021, the 100th anniversary, and new film projects are in development to bring attention to the event. The massacre challenges the narrative of black progress in America, revealing a history of systematic violence and suppression. END OF SUMMARY.
