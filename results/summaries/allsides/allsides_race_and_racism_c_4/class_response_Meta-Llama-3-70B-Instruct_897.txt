SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a devastating event that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, which occurred on May 31, 1921, was sparked by an unproven accusation of an assault of a white woman by a black man, leading to a violent rampage by white mobs who looted homes, burned businesses, and killed residents in the Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street." By June 1, 35 city blocks had been burned to the ground, leaving thousands homeless and an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. The event was subsequently buried, and a widespread effort was made to strip the historical record of evidence, mislabeling it as a "riot" and minimizing its true impact. The discovery of the mass graves is a crucial step towards acknowledging the massacre and upending the sanitized version of American history that has been perpetuated. END OF SUMMARY.
