SUMMARY: Recently, scientists discovered mass graves in Tulsa, Oklahoma, connected to a tragic race massacre in 1921. The massacre, fueled by racial resentment and an unfounded accusation, resulted in the destruction of the thriving Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. Despite the devastating impact, with thousands left homeless and hundreds potentially killed, the Tulsa race massacre has been largely forgotten or omitted from history. The event has been mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing the targeted nature of the attack and absolving the white mob of responsibility. The efforts to erase this incident from history, including altering newspaper records and excluding it from educational curricula, have been largely successful. However, the discovery of mass graves and increased media attention, including upcoming film and television projects, are bringing this important piece of American history to light. This massacre challenges the popular narrative of black progress in America and highlights the specific targeting of black success. It is crucial to acknowledge and remember this tragic event to provide a more complete understanding of our past and the ongoing struggle for racial justice.
