SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists have recently discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the Tulsa race massacre of 1921. The massacre, considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history, has been largely buried and forgotten. The prosperous Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as "Black Wall Street," was attacked by a white mob after an unproven accusation of assault. The violence resulted in looting, burning, and killing, leaving thousands homeless and hundreds dead. Despite the scale of the incident, it has been largely unknown, with many Americans only becoming aware of it through a recent TV show. The debate surrounds the mislabeling of the event as a "riot," the systematic effort to erase it from history, and its contradiction of the popular narrative of black progress in America. Further examination of the possible mass grave sites and DNA testing are planned, with local leaders hoping to complete the project by the 100th anniversary in 2021.

END OF SUMMARY.
