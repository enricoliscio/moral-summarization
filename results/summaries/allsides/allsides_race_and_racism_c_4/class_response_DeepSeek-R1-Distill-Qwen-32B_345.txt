Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing. The user specified that I should use as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me start by reading the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article discusses the discovery of mass graves related to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. It highlights how the event was buried in history, the violence committed, and the systematic erasure of evidence. The user provided a list of morally framed words that I should include in the summary.

I should structure the summary to cover the key events: the discovery, the historical context of the massacre, the violence, the subsequent cover-up, and the ongoing efforts to uncover the truth. I need to ensure that I use words like "massacre," "violence," "buried," "accusation," "looting," "burning," "killing," "forgotten," "attack," "effort," "strip," "riot," "minimized," "rampage," "omitted," "mislabeled," "targeting," "blamed," "absolved," "bombing," "sanitized," "erase," "tossed," "unmarked," "cut," "upends," "scrambles."

I'll start by mentioning the discovery of the mass graves and the historical significance of the massacre. Then, I'll describe the violence and the initial event that triggered it. I'll note the official death count and the higher estimates. Next, I'll discuss how the event was forgotten and the reasons behind thatâ€”cover-ups, mislabeling as a riot, and the erasure of evidence. Finally, I'll mention the current efforts to excavate and the cultural projects bringing attention to the massacre.

I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and ensure it flows well while incorporating the moral language. Let me draft it step by step, making sure each point is covered succinctly.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Okla., used ground-penetrating radar to uncover evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a tragic event often buried in U.S. history. The massacre began after an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman, leading to white mobs flooding Greenwood, a thriving black neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street." The violence included looting, burning, and killing, with at least 36 deaths, though historians estimate up to 300. Despite its scale, the massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to strip historical records of evidence. For decades, it was mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing its impact and flipping the narrative to blame black Tulsans and absolve white perpetrators. The event was omitted from Oklahoma public schools until 2000 and remains underrepresented in American history. Scientists are now examining potential mass graves, while local leaders and cultural projects aim to bring the truth to light before the 100th anniversary in 2021. The massacre challenges the narrative of black progress in America, highlighting a period of widespread racial violence often sanitized or erased from history. END OF SUMMARY.
