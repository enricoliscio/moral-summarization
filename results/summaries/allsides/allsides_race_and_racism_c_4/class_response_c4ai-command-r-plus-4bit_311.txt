SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre there using ground-penetrating radar. The Tulsa race massacre, also known as the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely buried and forgotten until recently. On May 31, 1921, an accusation of assault by a black man against a white woman sparked a rampage of white resentment that had been bubbling for years. White mobs looted homes, burned businesses, and killed residents in the Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street." Despite the official death toll of 36, historians believe the actual number could be as high as 300. The event was long mislabeled as a riot, minimizing the targeted nature of the attack and absolving the white mob of blame. The massacre was omitted from history books and stripped from the historical record through a systematic effort to erase it from memory. It was not taught in Oklahoma schools until 2000 and has only recently gained wider attention through popular culture. Further examination of the possible mass grave sites is needed before excavation can take place, with local leaders hoping to complete the project by the 100th anniversary in 2021.
END OF SUMMARY.
