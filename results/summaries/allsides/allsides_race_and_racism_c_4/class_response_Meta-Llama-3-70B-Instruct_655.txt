SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a brutal incident of racial violence that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, which occurred on May 31, 1921, was sparked by an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman, leading to white mobs flooding into the Greenwood District, looting homes, burning businesses, and killing residents. By June 1, 35 city blocks had been burned to the ground, leaving thousands homeless and resulting in an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. The event has been mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing its true impact and blaming black Tulsans while absolving the white mob. A systematic effort to erase the event from history was largely successful, with news accounts cut out and the incident omitted from school curricula. The discovery of the mass graves is a significant step towards acknowledging and remembering this dark chapter in American history. END OF SUMMARY.
