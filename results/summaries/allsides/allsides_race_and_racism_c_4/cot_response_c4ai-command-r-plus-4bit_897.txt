SUMMARY:
A recent discovery in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has brought to light a dark chapter in American history that had been largely forgotten and intentionally buried: the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. This incident, fueled by white resentment and targeting Black success, resulted in the destruction of the prosperous Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. The true scale of the violence, which included looting, burning, and killing, left thousands homeless and decimated 35 city blocks. 

For decades, the massacre was mislabeled as a riot, minimizing the premeditated nature of the attack and shifting blame onto the Black community. This event, part of a broader pattern of racial violence in the post-Civil War era, contradicts the popular narrative of Black progress in America. It reveals a history of systemic efforts to erase the massacre from the historical record, including the removal of news accounts and exclusion from educational curricula. 

The discovery of possible mass grave sites has sparked renewed interest in bringing this hidden history to light. Local leaders, along with filmmakers and television producers, are working to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the massacre in 2021. This tragic event serves as a reminder of the ongoing need to confront America's legacy of racial violence and the persistent efforts to minimize and erase its existence.
