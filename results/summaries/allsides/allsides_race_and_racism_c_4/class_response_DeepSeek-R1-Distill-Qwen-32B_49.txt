Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me start by reading the article carefully. It's about the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, where ground-penetrating radar found mass graves. The author uses strong moral words like "massacre," "violence," "buried," and "forgotten." I should keep those in the summary.

The article explains that the Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, was destroyed. I need to include the causes: an unproven accusation leading to white mobs attacking, looting, burning, and killing. The death toll is mentioned as 36 officially, but possibly up to 300. The event was minimized as a riot, which downplays the violence.

It's important to note that the massacre was forgotten for decades, with efforts to erase it from history. The recent discovery and upcoming commemorations are key points. Also, the moral implications of mislabeling it as a riot instead of a targeted attack on black success should be included.

I'll structure the summary to highlight the historical violence, the cover-up, and the recent efforts to uncover the truth. I'll make sure to use the morally charged words to convey the gravity of the event and its suppression.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, used ground-penetrating radar to uncover evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a tragic event often referred to as "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history." The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs, fueled by an unproven accusation, looted, burned, and killed, leaving 35 city blocks in ruins and thousands homeless. The official death toll was 36, but historians estimate up to 300 deaths. Despite its scale, the massacre has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase it from history through mislabeling it as a "riot," minimizing its impact. The event was omitted from Oklahoma schools until 2000 and rarely included in American history textbooks. Recent discoveries and upcoming commemorations aim to shed light on this buried past. END OF SUMMARY.
