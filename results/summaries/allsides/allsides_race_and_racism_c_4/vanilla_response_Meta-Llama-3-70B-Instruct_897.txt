SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten event in American history. The massacre, which occurred on May 31, 1921, was sparked by an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman, leading to white mobs looting and burning homes and businesses in the Greenwood District, a vibrant neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street." The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. The event was largely omitted from historical records, and its true impact was minimized by referring to it as a "riot." Local leaders hope to complete the excavation of the possible mass grave sites by the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021. The discovery has sparked renewed interest in the massacre, with feature films and TV series in development.
