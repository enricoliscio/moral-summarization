SUMMARY: 
Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten part of U.S. history. The massacre, which occurred when white mobs flooded into the Greenwood District, looting homes, burning businesses, and killing residents, was sparked by an unproven accusation of an assault of a white woman by a black man. The event, known as "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history," resulted in the deaths of up to 300 people and left thousands homeless. Despite its scale, the massacre has been buried, with many Americans only becoming aware of it this year. The people of Tulsa have been hesitant to talk about it, and there was a widespread effort to strip the historical record of evidence of the event, omitting it from the preferred narrative of black progress in America. The massacre contradicts this narrative, upending the accepted timeline and scrambling the history lessons that Americans pass down.
