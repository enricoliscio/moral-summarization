SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a brutal event that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, which occurred on May 31, 1921, was sparked by an unproven accusation of an assault of a white woman by a black man, leading to white mobs flooding into the Greenwood District, looting homes, burning businesses, and killing residents. By June 1, 35 city blocks had been burned to the ground, leaving thousands homeless and resulting in an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. The incident has been mislabeled as a "riot" and minimized, stripping the historical record of evidence and omitting it from the preferred narrative of black progress in America. A systematic effort to erase the event from history was largely successful, but local leaders hope to excavate the possible mass grave sites and complete the project by the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021.
