SUMMARY:
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a recent discovery has brought to light a dark chapter in American history: the 1921 race massacre that decimated the prosperous Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street." The accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman sparked a wave of racial violence as white mobs looted, burned, and killed, leaving 35 city blocks in ruins and thousands homeless. Despite an official death toll of 36, historians estimate the true number could be as high as 300. The Tulsa race massacre was long buried, with a systematic effort to erase it from history, mislabeling it as a "riot" and minimizing the true impact of the rampage. Many Americans are just now learning about this horrific event, which counters the narrative of black progress and passive victims. Further investigation is needed to uncover the full extent of the massacre, with plans for a film and TV series aiming to shed light on this tragic yet important part of American history.
