SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have uncovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a brutal incident of racial violence that has been largely forgotten in American history. The massacre, which occurred in the thriving Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was sparked by an unproven accusation of assault by a black man against a white woman, leading to a rampage of looting, burning, and killing by white mobs. By the end, 35 city blocks were burned to the ground, leaving thousands homeless and an estimated 36 to 300 deaths. The incident was mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing its true impact, and a systematic effort was made to erase it from history, including stripping the historical record of evidence and omitting it from textbooks. The discovery of the mass graves is a crucial step towards uncovering the truth and bringing justice to the victims and their families. END OF SUMMARY.
