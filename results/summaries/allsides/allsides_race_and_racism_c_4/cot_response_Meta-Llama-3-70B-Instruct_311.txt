SUMMARY:
The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely forgotten and whitewashed from U.S. history. A recent discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar has brought attention to the event, which was previously mislabeled as a "riot" to minimize its impact. The massacre, which left thousands homeless and killed up to 300 people, was a result of long-bubbling white resentment towards the successful black community in Greenwood, known as "Black Wall Street." The event contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America, and its erasure from history was a systematic effort to strip the historical record of evidence. Local leaders hope to complete the project in time for the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021, and feature films and TV series are in development to shed light on this dark chapter in American history.
