SUMMARY:
The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely forgotten and buried. The vibrant Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed by white mobs fueled by resentment and a false accusation. The violence left thousands homeless and an estimated 36-300 deaths. The event was subsequently erased from history through a systematic effort to strip the historical record of evidence. The massacre contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America, and its omission has allowed for a whitewashed and sanitized version of American history. Recently, scientists discovered evidence of mass graves, and further examination is necessary to uncover the truth. END OF SUMMARY.
