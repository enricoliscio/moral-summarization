SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the Tulsa race massacre of 1921. The massacre, considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history, was sparked by a false accusation of assault against a white woman by a black man. White mobs then flooded the predominantly black Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, looting and burning businesses and killing residents. Despite the scale of the attack, with hundreds of deaths, the Tulsa massacre has been largely forgotten and omitted from history. The event was mislabeled as a riot, minimizing the targeted nature of the violence and absolving the white perpetrators. There was also a systematic effort to erase the massacre from history, with bodies tossed into mass graves and news accounts stripped from records. Only recently has the incident gained attention, with plans for a feature film and TV series in development. Further examination of the mass grave sites is needed before excavation and potential identification of remains. Local leaders hope to complete the project by the 100th anniversary of the massacre in 2021.
