SUMMARY:

The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely forgotten and buried. The event, which occurred in the thriving Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as "Black Wall Street," saw white mobs loot, burn, and kill, leaving thousands homeless and an estimated 36-300 deaths. Despite its scale, the massacre has been omitted from historical records, with law enforcement and insurance companies declining to act, and a widespread effort to erase evidence of the event. The incident contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America, and its erasure has been largely successful. However, recent discoveries using ground-penetrating radar have uncovered evidence of mass graves, and scientists plan to excavate the sites. The massacre's rediscovery has sparked debate, with many Americans learning about it for the first time through a fictionalized reenactment in the HBO drama "Watchmen."
