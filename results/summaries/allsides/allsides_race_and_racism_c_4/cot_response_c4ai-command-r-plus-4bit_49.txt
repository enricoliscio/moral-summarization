SUMMARY:
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, scientists have recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, bringing to light a long-buried history of racial violence and resentment. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was a thriving black neighborhood until May 31, 1921, when an accusation of assault sparked a wave of white violence. The massacre resulted in the burning of 35 city blocks, thousands left homeless, and an official death toll of 36, although the actual number is believed to be much higher. The Tulsa race massacre has been largely forgotten and mislabeled as a riot, with a systematic effort to erase it from history. Many Americans are unaware of the incident, which contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America. Local leaders and scientists are working to excavate the mass grave sites and bring attention to this tragic event, with several film and television projects in development. The Tulsa race massacre serves as a stark reminder of the violent targeting of black success and the ongoing need to confront and remember this dark chapter in American history.
