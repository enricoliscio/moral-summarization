SUMMARY: Ground-penetrating radar has revealed mass graves in Tulsa, Oklahoma, offering new evidence of a 1921 race massacre there that has long been buried. The Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as Black Wall Street, was a thriving black neighborhood until May 31, 1921, when an accusation of assault by a black man against a white woman sparked a wave of white resentment that culminated in violence. White mobs looted, burned, and killed, leaving 35 city blocks in ruins and thousands homeless. Despite the official death toll of 36, historians believe the true number could be as high as 300. The Tulsa race massacre, once mislabeled as a "riot," has been largely forgotten, due in part to a systematic effort to erase it from history and a preference for a sanitized narrative of black progress in America. Local leaders are now working to excavate the mass grave sites and bring attention to this tragic event in time for its 100th anniversary in 2021.
