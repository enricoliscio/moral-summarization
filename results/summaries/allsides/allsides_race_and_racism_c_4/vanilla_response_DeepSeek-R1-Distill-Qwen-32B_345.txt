Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about the Tulsa race massacre. Let me read through it carefully. The article talks about how scientists found mass graves using ground-penetrating radar. The massacre happened in 1921, and it's considered one of the worst racial violence incidents in U.S. history.

The Greenwood District was a thriving black neighborhood, called Black Wall Street. But on May 31, 1921, violence broke out after an accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman. White mobs destroyed the area, burned 35 blocks, left thousands homeless, and killed many peopleâ€”36 officially, but likely up to 300.

The article mentions that the massacre is not well-known, partly because people in Tulsa didn't talk about it. There was an effort to erase it from history, like changing the name to a riot, which downplayed the severity. Historians think it's part of a pattern of racial violence after the Civil War that's often ignored in the narrative of black progress.

Now, there's an effort to find mass graves, and plans for films and TV shows to bring attention to the event. The anniversary in 2021 is a target for completing the project.

I should include all these points concisely. Start with the discovery, the event, the impact, why it's forgotten, and current efforts. Keep it under 200 words, so I'll need to be brief but cover all key aspects.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, using ground-penetrating radar, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, one of the worst incidents of racial violence in U.S. history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs burned 35 city blocks, killing up to 300 people and leaving thousands homeless. The massacre, initially labeled a "riot," has been underreported due to efforts to erase its history, including minimal documentation and exclusion from educational curricula. Recent efforts aim to uncover the truth, with plans to excavate potential mass graves and honor the 100th anniversary in 2021. The event challenges the narrative of black progress in America, highlighting a period of widespread racial violence often overlooked. END OF SUMMARY.
