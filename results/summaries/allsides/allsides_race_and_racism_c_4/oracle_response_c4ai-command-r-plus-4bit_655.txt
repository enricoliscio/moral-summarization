SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre there, bringing attention to an incident that has been largely forgotten in US history. The Tulsa race massacre, also known as the Tulsa race riot, was a deadly event fueled by white resentment and racial violence. On May 31, 1921, a false accusation of assault by a black man against a white woman sparked a rampage by white mobs in the Greenwood District, home to Tulsa's black population and known as "Black Wall Street." The attack resulted in looting, burning, and killing, leaving 35 city blocks destroyed and thousands homeless. The official death count was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. The aftermath of the incident was characterized by a lack of action from authorities and insurance companies, contributing to a systematic effort to erase the massacre from history. Many Americans were unaware of the Tulsa race massacre until it was featured in the HBO series "Watchmen." Further examination of possible mass grave sites is underway, and efforts to raise awareness about the incident through film and television projects are also in development. The Tulsa race massacre serves as a stark reminder of the violent racial history of America and the ongoing need to confront and remember these tragic events.
