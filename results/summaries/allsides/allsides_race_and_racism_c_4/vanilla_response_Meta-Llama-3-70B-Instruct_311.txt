SUMMARY: 

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have used ground-penetrating radar to uncover evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten event in American history. The massacre occurred when a white woman accused a black man of assault, sparking violence and destruction in the Greenwood District, a thriving black neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street." The event left thousands homeless and an estimated 36-300 deaths. Despite its significance, the massacre has been largely omitted from historical records, with many Americans learning about it for the first time this year through a fictionalized reenactment in the HBO drama "Watchmen." Historians believe the incident was part of a period of widespread racial violence after the Civil War, but was omitted to maintain a narrative of black progress in America. Further examination of the mass grave sites is necessary, with local leaders hoping to complete the project by the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021.
