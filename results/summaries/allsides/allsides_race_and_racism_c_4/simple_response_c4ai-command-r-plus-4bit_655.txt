SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre there, bringing attention to an incident that has been largely forgotten in U.S. history. The massacre, sparked by an unproven accusation of assault, resulted in the destruction of the vibrant Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. The white mob violence caused thousands of residents to become homeless and resulted in a significant loss of life, with estimates ranging from 36 to 300 deaths. The event has been intentionally buried and minimized, with efforts to erase it from history through the destruction of evidence and the use of misleading labels such as "riot". The recent discovery of possible mass grave sites and the development of media projects about the massacre may bring much-needed awareness to this tragic and shameful incident in American history. It is important to acknowledge and remember this event to understand the true extent of racial violence and the systematic efforts to oppress and erase the successes of the black community in the United States.
