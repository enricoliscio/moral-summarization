Alright, I need to summarize the given news article about the Tulsa Race Massacre while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points.

The article talks about the recent discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This connects to the 1921 race massacre, which is described as one of the worst racial violence incidents in U.S. history. The Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, was thriving but was destroyed when white mobs attacked after a false accusation. The death toll was underestimated, and the event was largely forgotten, even being mislabeled as a riot. Efforts to erase the event from history were successful, and it's only recently gaining attention, partly due to media like "Watchmen." The summary should highlight the historical erasure, the moral implications of minimizing the violence, and the ongoing efforts to uncover the truth.

I need to ensure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes the main points: the discovery, the massacre's history, the cover-up, the impact on American history narratives, and current efforts to address it. I'll structure it to flow logically, starting with the discovery, then the event, the cover-up, and current developments, ending with the moral implications of historical erasure.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered potential mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, one of the worst incidents of racial violence in U.S. history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs attacked after a false accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman. The death toll was officially recorded as 36 but is now believed to be as high as 300. The event has been largely forgotten, with efforts to erase it from history, including mislabeling it as a "riot" and omitting it from educational curricula. The discovery highlights the moral failure of historical erasure and the need to confront the truth. Efforts to excavate and memorialize the victims are ongoing, with plans for films and TV series to bring attention to this forgotten chapter in American history. END OF SUMMARY.
