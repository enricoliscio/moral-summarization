SUMMARY:

Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have used ground-penetrating radar to discover evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre, a largely forgotten event in American history. The massacre, which occurred on May 31, 1921, was sparked by an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman, leading to white mobs looting and burning homes and businesses, killing residents, and leaving thousands homeless. The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. The event was largely unknown due to a widespread effort to erase it from history, with law enforcement and insurance companies declining to act, and a lack of paper trail. The discovery of the mass graves is a significant step towards uncovering the truth about this tragic event, with further examination and DNA testing planned. The 100th anniversary of the event in 2021 is expected to bring more attention to this dark chapter in American history.
