SUMMARY:
The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely forgotten and buried. The vibrant Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed by white mobs who looted homes, burned businesses, and killed residents, leaving thousands homeless. The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could be as high as 300. The event was mislabeled as a "riot," which minimized the true impact of the rampage and blamed black Tulsans while absolving the white mob. A systematic effort to erase the event from history was largely successful, and it contradicts the popular narrative of black progress in America. Now, scientists have discovered evidence of mass graves, and local leaders hope to complete the project in time for the 100th anniversary of the event in 2021. END OF SUMMARY.
