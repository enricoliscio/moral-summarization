SUMMARY:
The 1921 Tulsa race massacre, considered the "single worst incident of racial violence in American history," has been largely forgotten and buried. The event, which saw white mobs loot, burn, and kill in the thriving Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street," was sparked by an unproven accusation of assault. The massacre, which left thousands homeless and up to 300 dead, has been mislabeled as a "riot," minimizing its true impact. A systematic effort to erase the event from history was largely successful, with evidence destroyed, news accounts cut out, and the incident omitted from school curricula. The discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar has brought new attention to the massacre, contradicting the popular narrative of black progress in America. END OF SUMMARY.
