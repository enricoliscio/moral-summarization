Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Tulsa race massacre. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author provided. Hmm, the article talks about the discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar, which brings up the history of the 1921 massacre. It's described as one of the worst racial violence incidents in US history. 

The Greenwood District was a thriving black community, called Black Wall Street. But on May 31, 1921, a false accusation led to a violent attack by white mobs. They destroyed the area, burned buildings, killed people, and left thousands homeless. The official death toll was 36, but now they think it might be up to 300. The event was largely forgotten, even in textbooks, and was often referred to as a riot, which downplays the severity. 

The article also mentions that the HBO show "Watchmen" helped bring attention to it. There's a systematic effort to erase this history, like hiding evidence and not teaching it in schools. Now, they're looking into mass graves and planning to commemorate the 100th anniversary. The perspectives highlight how the event was mislabeled and how it contradicts the narrative of black progress in America.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: the discovery, the history of the massacre, the scale, the erasure from history, and the current efforts to remember it. Also, the moral framing is about the systemic suppression and the importance of acknowledging this dark past. I should keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows well.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a forgotten chapter of U.S. history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was a thriving black community until violence erupted after a false accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman. White mobs destroyed the area, burning 35 city blocks, leaving thousands homeless, and killing an estimated 300 people, though only 36 deaths were officially reported. The event, often mislabeled as a "riot," has been erased from historical records, with insurance companies and law enforcement failing to act, and schools omitting it until 2000. The HBO show "Watchmen" recently brought attention to the massacre. Efforts to excavate mass graves and honor the 100th anniversary in 2021 are underway, alongside film projects. The massacre challenges the narrative of black progress in America, highlighting systemic suppression of racial violence. END OF SUMMARY.
