SUMMARY: Using ground-penetrating radar, scientists discovered mass graves related to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, bringing attention to a largely forgotten incident of racial violence in US history. The massacre occurred in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as "Black Wall Street," a successful black neighborhood. On May 31, 1921, an accusation of assault by a black man against a white woman sparked a rampage of white resentment that led to looting, burning, and killing. Despite the official death toll of 36, the actual number of deaths could be as high as 300. The aftermath saw little action from authorities and insurance companies, and a systematic effort was made to erase the event from history, including mislabeling it as a riot. The massacre has been omitted from history books and was not taught in schools until recently. Many Americans became aware of the incident through a recent HBO drama, highlighting the contrast between the public awareness of the massacre in the black community and its relative obscurity among white Americans. Further examination of the mass grave sites and potential DNA testing are planned. Efforts to bring the massacre to light through film and television projects are also underway. The Tulsa race massacre serves as a stark reminder of the violent history of racial tension in America and challenges the narrative of black progress and white extremism.
