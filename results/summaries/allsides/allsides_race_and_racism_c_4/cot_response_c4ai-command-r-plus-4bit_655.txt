SUMMARY:
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, scientists recently discovered evidence of mass graves related to the 1921 race massacre in the city. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was a thriving black community until May 31, 1921, when an accusation of assault by a black man against a white woman sparked a wave of white resentment and violence. White mobs looted homes, burned businesses, and killed residents, leaving thousands homeless and up to 300 people dead. Despite the scale of the massacre, it has been largely forgotten in U.S. history due to a systematic effort to erase it from public memory and minimize its impact by mislabeling it as a "riot." This effort included removing news accounts from the historical record and omitting the event from school curricula and history textbooks. The massacre challenges the popular narrative of black progress in America and instead reveals a history of targeted racial violence and systemic injustice. Local leaders and historians are working to bring awareness to the tragedy and properly honor the victims through excavations and media projects ahead of the 100th anniversary of the massacre in 2021.
