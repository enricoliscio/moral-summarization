Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the Tulsa race massacre. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing the author used, which means I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. The article is quite detailed, so I need to condense it without losing the key points and the emotional weight.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It talks about the discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar, the history of the massacre, the initial violence, the cover-up, and the recent efforts to bring attention to it. The author uses words like "massacre," "violence," "buried," "accusation," "looting," "killing," "forgotten," etc., which I need to include.

I should start by mentioning the discovery of the mass graves and the historical context of the massacre. Then, explain how the event was covered up and minimized, using terms like "effort to erase," "mislabeled as a riot," and "sanitized history." It's important to highlight the impact on the community and the recent efforts to remember the event, such as the HBO show and upcoming projects.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and stays under 200 words. I'll structure it by first introducing the discovery, then the history, the cover-up, and finally the current efforts to remember the massacre. I'll use the morally framed words to convey the severity and the injustice of the situation.

Let me draft a few sentences and check the word count. I need to be concise but comprehensive. Maybe start with the discovery, then the event itself, the aftermath, and the recent developments. I should avoid technical jargon and keep it accessible while maintaining the moral tone.

I think I have a good structure. Now, I'll write the summary, making sure to include all the key points and the necessary morally framed words. I'll aim for clarity and conciseness, ensuring that each sentence adds value and contributes to the overall summary.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, used ground-penetrating radar to uncover evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a forgotten chapter of American history marked by violence and racial hatred. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was thriving before the massacre, which began with an unproven accusation of an assault by a black man on a white woman. White mobs flooded the area, looting, burning, and killing, leaving 35 city blocks in ruins and thousands homeless. While the official death toll was 36, historians estimate up to 300 deaths. The event, often mislabeled as a "riot," was systematically erased from history through suppression of records and avoidance of discussion. Efforts to minimize its impact, such as referring to it as a "riot," absolved white perpetrators and blamed black victims. Recent discoveries and cultural references, like the HBO series "Watchmen," have brought renewed attention to the massacre. Local leaders aim to excavate and identify remains in time for the 100th anniversary in 2021, while new media projects seek to shed light on this dark chapter of American history. END OF SUMMARY.
