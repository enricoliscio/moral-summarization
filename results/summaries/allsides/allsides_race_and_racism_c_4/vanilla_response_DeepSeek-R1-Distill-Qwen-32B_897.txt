Alright, I need to summarize this news article about the Tulsa Race Massacre. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning the discovery of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar in Tulsa. This connects to the 1921 race massacre, which is considered one of the worst racial violence incidents in US history. The Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, was thriving but destroyed in 1921.

The trigger was a false accusation, leading to white mobs attacking, burning, and killing. Official death toll was 36, but historians estimate up to 300. The event is largely forgotten, with many learning about it through the HBO show "Watchmen."

The article discusses why it's unknown: locals didn't talk about it, lack of documentation, and historical erasure. It was called a riot, minimizing its impact. Also, it's part of a period of racial violence often omitted from history.

Looking ahead, scientists need to examine the graves before excavation. Local leaders aim to complete the project by 2021 for the centennial. Media projects are in development, but no release dates yet.

Perspectives include the massacre being mislabeled, known in the black community, erased from history, and conflicting with the narrative of black progress.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words, focusing on the key points: the discovery, the event's history, why it's forgotten, and future plans.
