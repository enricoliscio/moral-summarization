SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma recently discovered evidence of mass graves connected to the 1921 race massacre there using ground-penetrating radar. The massacre, which took place in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as "Black Wall Street," was sparked by an unproven accusation of assault against a white woman by a black man and resulted in the destruction of 35 city blocks, leaving thousands homeless. The official death toll was 36, but historians believe it could have been as high as 300. Despite the scale of violence, the Tulsa race massacre has been largely forgotten, with many Americans only becoming aware of it through a recent episode of the HBO drama "Watchmen." Some attribute this to a hesitancy to talk about the event, while others believe it is part of a systematic effort to erase it from history. Further examination of the possible mass grave sites is needed before excavation can take place, and local leaders hope to have the project completed by the 100th anniversary of the massacre in 2021.
