Alright, so I need to help the user by summarizing this news article. Let me read through it carefully. The article is about the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, which I remember hearing about before but not in detail. The user wants a concise summary, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article mentions that scientists found evidence of mass graves using ground-penetrating radar. That's a significant discovery. The massacre happened in the Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street, which was a thriving black community. The violence started due to an unproven accusation, leading to widespread destruction and loss of life. The death toll is disputed, with official records showing 36 but estimates as high as 300.

I should note that the event has been underreported and why. The article talks about it being labeled a riot, which downplays the severity. Also, efforts to erase it from history, like removing news accounts and not including it in school curricula until recently.

Looking ahead, there are plans to investigate the mass graves further and possibly excavate them. There's also media projects in the works, like a feature film and TV series, which might bring more attention to the event.

I need to make sure the summary is under 200 words and captures all these points succinctly. I'll start by mentioning the discovery, then the background of the massacre, the reasons for its obscurity, and future plans. I should keep it clear and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary details. Let me structure it step by step to ensure all key aspects are covered without exceeding the word limit.

SUMMARY: Scientists in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have discovered evidence of mass graves linked to the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, a violent event often overlooked in U.S. history. The Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street," was destroyed when white mobs attacked after an unproven accusation of a black man assaulting a white woman. The violence left 35 blocks burned, thousands homeless, and at least 36 dead, though historians estimate up to 300 fatalities. The massacre has been downplayed or omitted from historical records, with efforts to erase its impact, including labeling it a "riot" and excluding it from education until recently. Plans to investigate and excavate potential mass graves aim to uncover the truth before the 100th anniversary in 2021. Media projects, including a film and TV series, may bring greater awareness to this forgotten chapter of American history. END OF SUMMARY.
