SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody following a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana that left a teacher and a student critically injured. The suspect, who has not been identified, was reported to have excused himself from the classroom and returned with two handguns. A science teacher reportedly tackled the student and swatted a gun out of his hand, preventing further injuries. Authorities have not confirmed if the teacher who tackled the student was one of the victims, but he was shot multiple times and underwent surgery. The shooting comes a week after a similar incident in Santa Fe, Texas, and has sparked responses from politicians and community leaders, including Vice President Mike Pence and Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb. The community of Noblesville, with a population of about 50,000, is in shock as the investigation into the incident continues.
