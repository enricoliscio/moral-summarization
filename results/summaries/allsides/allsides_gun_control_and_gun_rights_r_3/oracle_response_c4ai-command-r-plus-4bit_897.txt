SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting incident at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana that left a teacher and a student critically injured. Authorities reported that the suspect excused himself from the classroom and returned with two handguns, but the situation was resolved quickly thanks to the brave actions of a teacher who tackled the student and swatted a gun out of his hand. The teacher, identified as Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times and underwent surgery. The community was shaken by the tragedy, with politicians, sports teams, and parents expressing their thoughts, prayers, and concerns. This shooting comes just a week after the Santa Fe, Texas, high school attack that killed eight students and two teachers. The Indiana State Teachers Association asked when enough is enough, highlighting the responsibility to keep children safe from violence and the unconscionable fear they live in.
