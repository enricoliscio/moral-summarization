SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting at an Indiana middle school that critically injured a teacher and a student. The suspect was reportedly tackled by a teacher, who swatted a gun from his hand. This brave action likely prevented further injuries or deaths. Noblesville Police Department Chief Kevin Jowitt stated that the suspect had excused himself from the classroom and returned with two handguns. The teacher, Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times and underwent surgery. This tragic incident has shaken the community and prompted politicians to call for prayers and action to address the national crisis of school shootings. It comes just a week after the Santa Fe, Texas, high school shooting that killed ten people. The Indiana State Teachers Association issued a statement asking, "When is enough, enough?" emphasizing the urgent need to prioritize the safety of students and teachers in schools. 

END OF SUMMARY.
