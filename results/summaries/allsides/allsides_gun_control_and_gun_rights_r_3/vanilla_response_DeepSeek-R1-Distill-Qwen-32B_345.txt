Alright, so the user has provided a detailed news article about a school shooting in Noblesville, Indiana. They want me to summarize it, but with specific instructions. The summary needs to be after a "SUMMARY:" token and end with "END OF SUMMARY." It should be concise, no more than 200 words. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the key points. A male student was detained after a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School. Two people were injured, a teacher and a student. The suspect had two handguns. The teacher, Jason Seaman, tackled the shooter, saving others. The school had a resource officer, but no metal detectors. The situation was resolved quickly. Authorities are investigating, with agencies like the FBI involved. The community's reaction, including politicians and the school district, is mentioned. The incident is part of a national issue, as another shooting happened recently in Texas.

I need to condense this into a summary. Start with the main event: the shooting, the suspect, the injuries. Mention the teacher's heroic action. Note the school's security measures. Include the quick resolution and ongoing investigation. Highlight the community and political responses, and the broader context of school safety.

I should make sure the summary flows logically, covering who, what, when, where, why, and how. Keep it under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise but include all essential details.

Let me structure it: start with the incident, the suspect, injuries, the teacher's role, school security, resolution, investigation, community reactions, and the broader implications.

I'll avoid jargon and keep the language clear. Make sure to include the names of the teacher and the agencies involved as they're important. Also, mention the politician's responses to show the impact beyond the local community.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring it's within the word limit and includes all key points without being too verbose.
