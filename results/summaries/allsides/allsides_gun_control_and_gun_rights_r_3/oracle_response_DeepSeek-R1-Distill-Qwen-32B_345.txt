Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author used. The user provided a list of morally charged words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible without making the summary too longâ€”under 200 words.

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. A male student was detained after a shooting at an Indiana middle school, injuring a teacher and student. The police chief mentioned the threat, the suspect had handguns, and the teacher tackled the shooter. The school had a resource officer, and the incident was resolved quickly. The teacher was seriously injured. Politicians and organizations expressed support, and the community is shaken. The article also touches on the responsibility to keep kids safe and the ongoing crisis.

I need to structure the summary to include the shooting, injuries, threat, suspect, teacher's bravery, police response, community reaction, and the broader issue of school safety. I'll use the morally framed words like "shooting," "injured," "threat," "handguns," "teacher," "bravery," "praying," "community," "crisis," etc.

I should start with the shooting, mention the injuries, the suspect, the teacher's action, police involvement, then the community and political responses, and end with the call for responsibility. I'll make sure each sentence includes as many of the moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

Let me draft it step by step. First sentence: Shooting at school, male student detained, teacher and student injured. Next: Suspect had handguns, teacher tackled him. Then: Quick resolution, police and FBI involved. Next: Community shaken, teacher in surgery. Politicians and organizations praying. Finally: Responsibility to keep kids safe, crisis in schools.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll combine some points. Maybe something like:

"A male student was detained after a shooting at an Indiana middle school, leaving a teacher and student critically injured. The suspect, who had handguns, was tackled by the teacher, preventing further harm. Authorities are investigating the incident, with police and FBI on scene. The community is praying for the victims, shaken by the tragedy. Leaders emphasize the responsibility to keep schools safe amid the national crisis."

Wait, that's under 100 words. I can add more details. Maybe include the quick resolution, the teacher's name, and the broader impact.

"A male student was detained after a shooting at an Indiana middle school, critically injuring a teacher and student. The suspect, armed with handguns, was tackled by the teacher, preventing further harm. Authorities are investigating the incident, with police and FBI present. The community is praying for the victims, shaken by the tragedy. Leaders emphasize the responsibility to keep schools safe amid the national crisis."

Still concise but includes more moral words. I think that's a solid summary preserving the moral framing.
