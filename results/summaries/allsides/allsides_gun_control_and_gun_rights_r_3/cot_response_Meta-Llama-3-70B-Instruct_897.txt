SUMMARY:
A male student was taken into custody after a "terrible" shooting at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana, leaving a student and a teacher "critically injured". The suspect, who has not been identified, allegedly excused himself from class and returned with two handguns. A science teacher, Jason Seaman, reportedly tackled the student, saving many lives. "If it weren't for him, more of us would have been injured for sure," said a student. The teacher was shot multiple times and underwent surgery. Authorities praised the swift response of law enforcement and first responders. Politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, tweeted their "thoughts and prayers" to the victims and the community. The Indiana State Teachers Association asked, "When is enough, enough?" in response to the "unconscionable" violence. The incident comes a week after a similar attack in Texas, highlighting the need for responsibility to keep kids safe from violence. END OF SUMMARY.
