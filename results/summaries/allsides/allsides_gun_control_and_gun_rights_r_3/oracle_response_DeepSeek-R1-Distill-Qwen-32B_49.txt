Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. A shooting occurred at an Indiana middle school, a student was detained, two people were injured, and there was a threat to another school. The teacher's brave action stopped the shooter, and the community is praying and reacting. 

I should identify the morally framed words the author used and include them in the summary. Words like "shooting," "injured," "threat," "incident," "investigating," "praying," "tragedy," "bravery," etc., are important. 

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and includes these terms. I'll structure it by mentioning the shooting, the suspect, the injuries, the teacher's action, the community's response, and the broader implications like school safety and fear. 

I'll start by stating the shooting incident, then the suspect's detention. Next, the injuries and the teacher's brave intervention. Then, the community's prayers and political responses. Finally, the broader concerns about school safety and the impact on the community. 

I should ensure the summary flows well and covers all key points without being too detailed. I'll check the word count to stay within the limit. Let me draft it step by step, making sure to include all necessary morally framed words.
