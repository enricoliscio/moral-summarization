Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what moral framing means here. It refers to words or phrases that carry a moral judgment or implication. 

The user provided a detailed news article about a school shooting. My task is twofold: first, identify all the single words that are morally framed, and second, write a concise summary that includes as many of these words as possible.

Starting with the first step, I'll go through the article and pick out words that convey moral judgment. Words like "tragedy," "critical," "bravery," "crisis," "unconscionable," etc., stand out as they carry emotional or moral weight.

Next, for the summary, I need to condense the article into about 200 words, making sure to include the morally framed words. I should highlight the key events: the shooting, the injured, the suspect, the heroic teacher, the community's response, and the broader implications.

I also need to ensure the summary flows well and covers all essential points without being too verbose. I'll structure it by mentioning the incident, the victims, the suspect, the heroic actions, the community's reaction, and the calls for action to prevent future incidents.

Finally, I'll make sure to end the summary with the specified tokens and keep the language clear and concise, preserving the moral elements as instructed.
