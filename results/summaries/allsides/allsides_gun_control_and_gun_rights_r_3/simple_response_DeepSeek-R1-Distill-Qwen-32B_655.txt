Alright, so the user wants me to summarize a news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I need to understand what the article is about. It's about a shooting at an Indiana middle school where a student was arrested, a teacher and student were injured, and there were some quick actions by the teacher to stop the shooter. 

I should focus on the key points: who, what, when, where, why. The main elements are the suspect, the injuries, the quick resolution, the teacher's heroism, the community's reaction, and the broader context of school safety.

I also need to keep the moral framing, which includes highlighting the heroism of the teacher, the community support, and the calls for action to prevent future incidents. The user mentioned it should be a summary after "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." It needs to be concise, under 200 words.

I should structure it by starting with the event, then the suspect, the injuries, the teacher's actions, the community's response, and the broader implications. Make sure to mention the quick resolution, the resource officer, and the political and public reactions. Also, include the statement from the teachers' association to show the moral call to action.

I need to ensure that all important details are included without being too verbose. Let me check the word count as I go to stay within the limit. Okay, I think I have a good structure in mind. Time to put it all together concisely.
