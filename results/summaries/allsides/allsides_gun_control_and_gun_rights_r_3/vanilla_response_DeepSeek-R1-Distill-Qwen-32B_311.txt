Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about a shooting at an Indiana middle school. The user wants the summary to be concise, no more than 200 words, and it should start with "SUMMARY:" and end with "END OF SUMMARY." They also provided an example response, so I can use that as a guide.

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The key details are:

- A male student was detained after a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School.
- A teacher and student were critically injured.
- The suspect had two handguns.
- A teacher tackled the shooter, possibly saving more lives.
- The school has a resource officer but no metal detectors.
- The FBI and ATF are investigating.
- The community's reaction, including political figures and the school district.
- The shooting happened a week after the Santa Fe, Texas incident.

I need to condense these points into a coherent summary. I should make sure to include the who, what, when, where, and why. Also, mention the outcome and the community's response briefly.

I should avoid getting too detailed on each point, keeping it within 200 words. Let me structure it:

1. Introduction: Shooting incident, suspect detained.
2. Injuries and immediate actions.
3. Details about the suspect and the quick resolution.
4. The teacher's brave action.
5. School's security measures and the investigation.
6. Community and political reactions.
7. Conclusion with the context of recent school shootings.

I need to make sure the summary flows well and covers all critical aspects without being too lengthy. Also, I should avoid jargon and keep it clear and straightforward.

Let me check the example provided to see how they structured it. They started with the incident, then the injuries, suspect details, the teacher's action, the investigation, community response, and the context of another shooting. That seems like a good structure to follow.

I should also ensure that I don't include unnecessary details, like specific names unless they're crucial. For example, mentioning the teacher's name if it's important, but in the example, they didn't include it. Maybe it's better to keep it general unless it's a key point.

I'll make sure to mention that the school had a resource officer but no metal detectors, as that's a point about security measures. Also, the fact that multiple agencies are involved in the investigation is important.

Including the political and community reactions shows the broader impact, so that should be part of the summary. The mention of the Santa Fe incident provides context about the frequency of such events.

I think I've covered all the main points. Now, I'll put it together in a concise manner, ensuring it's under 200 words and flows well.
