SUMMARY:
A male student was taken into custody as the suspect of a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana on Friday. The shooting critically injured a teacher and a student, who were both taken to the hospital with their families notified. Authorities, including the FBI and ATF, are investigating the incident, and an investigation has been opened into the shooting. The suspect reportedly excused himself from class and returned with two handguns, at which point a science teacher tackled him and swatted a gun out of his hand. This brave action potentially saved many lives. Following the shooting, there were concerns about a threat to Noblesville High School, but no evidence was found. Politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence and Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, sent their thoughts and prayers to the victims and the community. Gov. Holcomb also assured the deployment of 100 state police officers to support local law enforcement. The incident has raised concerns about school safety and the need to protect students from violence. It comes just a week after a tragic school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, that took the lives of ten individuals.
