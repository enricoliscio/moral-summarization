SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana that left a teacher and a student critically injured. Authorities reported that the suspect excused himself from the classroom and returned with two handguns, but the situation was quickly resolved thanks to the brave actions of a science teacher who tackled the gunman and swatted a gun out of his hand. The teacher, later identified as Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times and underwent surgery. The community, including Vice President Mike Pence and other politicians, expressed their shock and prayers for the victims and their families. The incident occurred just a week after a similar shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, leaving many to question when enough is enough in addressing this national crisis of school shootings.

END OF SUMMARY.
