Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The article is about a school shooting in Indiana, so the summary should highlight the key events, the response, and the moral implications.

First, I'll identify the main points: a male student was detained after a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School, two people were injured, a teacher intervened, and the community's reaction, including prayers and political statements. The moral aspect is the tragedy and the call for action to prevent future incidents.

I should mention the quick resolution thanks to the teacher, the resources available like the school resource officer, and the fact that the school doesn't have metal detectors. Also, the political and community responses, including the teachers' association questioning when enough is enough.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the essentials: the incident, the heroism of the teacher, the community's reaction, and the call for change. I'll make sure to include that the teacher was injured and that the community is praying and demanding action.

Putting it all together, the summary should flow logically from the event to the response and the moral questioning.
