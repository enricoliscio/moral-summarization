Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first. 

The article is about a shooting at an Indiana middle school. A student was detained, and a teacher and student were injured. The teacher, Jason Seaman, tackled the shooter, saving others. There's a lot of emotional language like "praying," "tragedy," and "bravery." 

I should include the key events: the shooting, the detention of the suspect, the injuries, the teacher's heroic action. Also, mention the community's response, including prayers and support from officials. 

I need to use as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. Words like "shooting," "injured," "threat," "incident," "monitoring," "investigating," "praying," "tragedy," "bravery," "crisis," "unconscionable," "fear," "attack," "killed." 

I should structure the summary to highlight the immediate events, the heroism of the teacher, the community's reaction, and the broader context of school safety. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft it step by step. Start with the shooting and detention, then the injuries and heroism. Mention the quick resolution and the resource officer. Include the community's prayers and political responses. Conclude with the broader implications and the call for action from the teachers' association.

Make sure to include the morally charged words without making it too verbose. Focus on the key points and emotions conveyed in the article.
