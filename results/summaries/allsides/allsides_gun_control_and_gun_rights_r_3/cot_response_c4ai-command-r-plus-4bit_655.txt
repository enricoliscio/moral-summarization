SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting incident at an Indiana middle school that left a student and a teacher critically injured. The suspect was reportedly tackled by a brave teacher, who managed to swat a gun out of his hand. The teacher and a student were injured and taken to the hospital, and the suspect was taken into custody. Authorities are investigating the incident and have opened an investigation into the shooting. The suspect excused himself from the classroom and returned with handguns, but the situation was quickly resolved thanks to the brave teacher and a resource officer who was present at the school. The shooting comes just a week after a similar tragedy in Santa Fe, Texas, and has left the community shaken and scared. Many have expressed their prayers for the victims and their families, and politicians have called for an end to these terrible acts of violence. The Governor of Indiana has offered his thoughts and prayers and has ensured that state leaders are doing everything they can to support the community during this difficult time. This national crisis of school shootings must end, and it is our responsibility to keep our children safe from such unconscionable acts of violence.
