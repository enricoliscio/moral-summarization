Alright, so I need to summarize this news article about a school shooting in Indiana. Let me read through the article carefully to understand the key points.

First, the main event is a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School where a male student was detained. Two people were injuredâ€”a teacher and a student. The police chief mentioned that the suspect had two handguns. The incident was resolved quickly, and the school had a resource officer on-site. A teacher tackled the shooter, which prevented more injuries. The teacher, Jason Seaman, was seriously injured and underwent surgery.

The article also mentions the community's reaction, with politicians and the Colts organization offering support and prayers. The governor provided updates and had law enforcement on standby. Parents were understandably worried, with one mother rushing to get her child. The incident happened a week after another school shooting in Texas, which adds context about the frequency of such events.

I need to condense this into a concise summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main facts: who was involved, what happened, the quick resolution, the teacher's heroism, the injuries, the response from authorities and the community, and the broader context of recent shootings.

I should structure the summary to start with the event, then the suspect and victims, the actions taken, the aftermath, and the reactions. I'll make sure to mention the teacher's role and the support from various officials without getting too detailed.

Let me check the word count as I draft to ensure it's within the limit. I'll avoid unnecessary details and keep each sentence focused on the key points. Also, I need to end with the specified tokens.

Okay, I think I have a good structure in mind. Now, I'll write the summary accordingly, making sure it's clear and covers all the essential information without exceeding the word limit.
