Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing that the author gave it. Let me start by reading through the article to understand the main points.

The article is about a shooting at a middle school in Noblesville, Indiana. A male student was detained after the incident, which left a teacher and a student critically injured. The police chief mentioned that the suspect had two handguns and that the situation was resolved quickly. There was a resource officer at the school, but no metal detectors. A teacher tackled the suspect, saving many students. The teacher, Jason Seaman, was seriously injured and had surgery. Politicians and the community responded with prayers and support. The article also raises questions about school safety and when enough violence will be enough.

Now, the moral framing here seems to emphasize the heroism of the teacher, the community's support, and the ongoing issue of school safety. The author is highlighting the bravery and the tragedy, as well as the broader societal issue of school shootings.

I need to make sure the summary includes these elements: the shooting incident, the suspect, the injured teacher and student, the quick resolution, the teacher's heroism, the community and political responses, and the call for action on school safety.

I should keep the summary concise, under 200 words, and make sure it flows logically, highlighting the moral aspects without adding my own opinions.

Let me structure it: start with the incident, mention the suspect and victims, the teacher's heroic action, the community's response, and the call for change.

I should also include the aftermath, like the teacher's surgery and the police presence. Maybe mention the lack of metal detectors and the resource officer.

I need to make sure it's all within 200 words and flows naturally, ending with the moral question about school safety.

Alright, I think I have a good structure in mind. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure each key point is included and the moral framing is preserved.
