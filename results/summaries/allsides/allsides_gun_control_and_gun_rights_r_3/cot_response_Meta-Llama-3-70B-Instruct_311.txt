SUMMARY:
A "terrible" shooting occurred at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana, leaving a student and a teacher "critically injured". The suspect, a male student, was taken into custody after excusing himself from class and returning with two handguns. A heroic teacher, identified as Jason Seaman, "immediately ran at him, swatted a gun out of his hand and tackled him to the ground", likely preventing further harm. The community is in "fear" and "praying" for the victims, with many politicians and organizations offering "thanks" and condolences. The Indiana State Teachers Association is calling for action, asking "When is enough, enough?" in response to this "unconscionable" act of violence. The incident is a harsh reminder of the "responsibility" to keep children "safe" from violence. END OF SUMMARY.
