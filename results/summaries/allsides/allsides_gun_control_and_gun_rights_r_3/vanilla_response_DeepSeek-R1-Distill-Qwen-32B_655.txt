Okay, so the user wants me to summarize a news article about a school shooting. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article mentions a male student was detained after a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana. A teacher and a student were critically injured. The suspect had two handguns and the situation was resolved quickly. A teacher tackled the shooter, possibly saving more lives. The school had a resource officer present. The victims' identities aren't revealed yet, but the teacher, Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times. Several politicians and organizations expressed support and prayers. The community is shaken, and parents are concerned. The incident happened a week after another school shooting in Texas, which adds to the national crisis context.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll start by stating the main event: a male student detained after a shooting, injuries, and the quick resolution. Then mention the teacher's brave action, the resource officer, and the victims' status. Include the community's reaction, political responses, and the context of recent shootings. Keep it concise, making sure all key points are covered without unnecessary details.
