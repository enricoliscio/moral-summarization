Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully. 

So, a male student was arrested after a shooting at an Indiana middle school. Two people were injuredâ€”a teacher and a student. The incident happened at 9:06 a.m. ET on Friday. The suspect had two handguns when he returned to the classroom. A teacher tackled him, which probably prevented more injuries. The teacher, Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times and had surgery. The school doesn't have metal detectors but has a full-time resource officer. The police and FBI are investigating. The school was evacuated, and some students were moved to the high school as a precaution. The governor and other officials are involved, and there's a lot of public reaction, including prayers and statements from politicians and the Colts. The community is shaken, and parents are worried. The shooting happened a week after the Texas school attack. 

I should condense this into a summary under 200 words. I'll focus on the main points: the incident, the suspect, the injuries, the quick resolution by the teacher, the investigation, the school's security measures, the evacuation, the public and political reactions, and the context of recent school shootings.

Let me structure it: start with the shooting, who was involved, what happened, the response, and the aftermath. Make sure to include the teacher's heroism, the lack of metal detectors, the evacuation, and the broader context.

I need to keep it concise, so I'll omit some details like the specific number of gunshots and the exact number of students. I'll mention the key players: the teacher, the suspect, the police, and the officials.

Putting it all together, I'll make sure each sentence is clear and covers the essential information without exceeding the word limit. I'll also ensure that the summary flows logically from the incident to the response and the reactions.
