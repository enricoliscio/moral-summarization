SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting incident at an Indiana middle school that left a student and a teacher critically injured. Authorities praised the quick response of a teacher who tackled the student and swatted a gun out of his hand, likely preventing further injuries. The teacher, identified as Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times and underwent surgery. The suspect, who has not been identified, was reported to have excused himself from the classroom and returned with two handguns. The shooting has sparked an outpouring of thoughts and prayers from politicians and the community, with many expressing their support for the victims and their families. It also raises concerns about school safety and the fear that students live with regarding potential attacks. The incident comes just a week after a tragic school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed ten people. Noblesville, a town of about 50,000 people, is now grappling with the aftermath of this critical situation, and investigators are working to ensure such incidents do not occur again.
