Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants a summary of a news article, but with a specific focus on preserving the moral framing that the original author used. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a detailed news article about a school shooting in Indiana, along with a list of morally framed words. The task is to summarize the article, making sure to include as many of those words as possible without making the summary too long—under 200 words.

I should start by reading through the article to get the main points. A male student was detained after a shooting at a middle school, two people were injured, and there was a threat at another school. The teacher, Jason Seaman, intervened, which likely saved more lives. Authorities are investigating, and there's a lot of community and political response, including prayers and offers of support.

Now, I need to identify the key morally framed words from the list provided. Words like "shooting," "injured," "threat," "incident," "investigating," "horrific," "praying," "thoughts," "bravery," "tragedy," "difficult," "affected," "arms," "shaken," "scared," "gunshots," "crisis," "responsibility," "safe," "violence," "unconscionable," "fear," "attack," "killed." These words carry emotional weight and convey the moral implications of the event.

I should structure the summary to include these words naturally. Start with the incident, mention the suspect and injuries, the threat at another school, the teacher's brave action, the community's response, and the broader implications of school safety.

I also need to keep the summary concise. I'll make sure each sentence includes one or more of the key moral words without making it sound forced. For example, "A male student was detained following a shooting at an Indiana middle school, leaving a teacher and student critically injured." This includes "detained," "shooting," "injured," which are all from the list.

I should also highlight the teacher's actions, as that's a moral point—saving others. Mentioning the prayers and support from the community and officials adds to the moral framing. Finally, touch on the broader crisis and the call for action to prevent future incidents.

I need to ensure that the summary flows well and covers all critical points without exceeding 200 words. I'll check the word count as I go, making sure each sentence is impactful and includes the necessary moral terms.

Putting it all together, the summary should start with the incident, describe the suspect and victims, the teacher's intervention, the community's response, and the broader implications. Each part should incorporate the morally framed words to maintain the author's original tone.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly, making sure it's within the word limit and includes all the necessary elements with the moral framing preserved.
