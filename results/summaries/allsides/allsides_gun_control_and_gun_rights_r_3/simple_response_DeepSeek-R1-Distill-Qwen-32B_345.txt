Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about the shooting at the middle school in Indiana. The user wants a summary that preserves the moral framing the author gave. Hmm, the article is quite detailed, so I need to pick out the key points while keeping the moral aspects intact.

First, the main event: a male student was detained after a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School. Two people were injured, a teacher and a student. The teacher, Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times and had to go into surgery. The article highlights his bravery because he tackled the suspect, saving others. That's a moral point about heroism.

The suspect had two handguns, which is concerning. The school didn't have metal detectors, but there was a resource officer present. The quick response by the teacher and the resource officer probably prevented more casualties. The moral angle here is about safety measures and the effectiveness of having trained personnel on site.

Politicians and the community are reacting with prayers and support. Pence, as the former governor, is involved, and other officials are monitoring the situation. The Colts organization also expressed their support, emphasizing community unity. This shows solidarity and the impact of such events on the community.

The Indiana State Teachers Association is asking when enough is enough, pointing out the national crisis of school shootings. This is a moral call for action, questioning why schools aren't safer and when the recurring incidents will stop.

I should also mention the quick resolution of the incident and the fact that the suspect was detained. The police and FBI are investigating, which is another point about law enforcement's role in these situations.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words, so I'll have to be concise. I'll start by stating the incident, the suspect, the injuries, the teacher's bravery, the lack of metal detectors, the resource officer, the community and political responses, the teachers' association's statement, and the overall impact on the community.

I should make sure to highlight the moral aspects: heroism, community support, the call for action on school safety, and the emotional impact on families. That should cover the main points while preserving the author's moral framing.
