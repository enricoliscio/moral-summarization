SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting incident at an Indiana middle school that critically injured a teacher and a student. Authorities have opened an investigation into the shooting and are working to ensure there is no further threat to the school. The quick actions of a teacher, who tackled the student and swatted a gun out of his hand, likely prevented more injuries. Politicians, community leaders, and organizations have expressed their thoughts and prayers for the victims and the community, with many calling for an end to these tragic and difficult situations. The shooting has brought to light the fear and violence that students and teachers face in schools across the country, and the responsibility to keep them safe.
