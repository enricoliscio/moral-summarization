Alright, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. Let me read through the article first to understand the key points.

The article is about a shooting at an Indiana middle school where a student was detained after a shooting incident. A teacher and student were critically injured. The suspect had two handguns and the situation was resolved quickly with the help of a teacher who tackled the shooter. The school had a resource officer but no metal detectors. The community's response, including politicians and organizations, is showing support and prayers. There's also a call for action on school safety.

I should highlight the heroism of the teacher, the quick resolution, the community's reaction, and the call for change. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main events and the moral aspects like bravery and the need for safety measures.

Let me structure the summary: start with the incident, mention the suspect and victims, the teacher's action, the community's response, and the call for change. Make sure to include the emotional impact and the broader implications.

I think that covers all the necessary points while keeping the moral framing intact. Now, I'll draft the summary accordingly.
