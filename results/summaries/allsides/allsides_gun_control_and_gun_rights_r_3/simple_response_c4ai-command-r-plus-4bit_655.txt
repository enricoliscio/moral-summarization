SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana that left a teacher and a student critically injured. The suspect, who has not been identified, excused himself from the classroom and returned with two handguns. The teacher, identified as Jason Seaman, tackled the student and swatted a gun out of his hand, likely preventing more injuries. Authorities have not confirmed whether Seaman was one of the victims, but his brother told the Indy Star that he was shot multiple times and underwent surgery. The shooting comes just a week after a similar tragedy in Santa Fe, Texas, and has prompted politicians and community leaders to call for an end to such violence. "When is enough, enough?" asked the Indiana State Teachers Association. Noblesville's community and the nation mourn and reflect on the loss of life and the ongoing threat to our children's safety in their schools.
END OF SUMMARY.
