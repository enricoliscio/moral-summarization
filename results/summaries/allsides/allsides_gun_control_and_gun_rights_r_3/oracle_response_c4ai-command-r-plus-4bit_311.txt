SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody following a shooting incident at an Indiana middle school that left a teacher and a student critically injured. Authorities have opened an investigation into the shooting, which was resolved quickly thanks to the brave actions of a teacher who tackled the student and swatted a gun out of his hand. The suspect had excused himself from the classroom and returned with two handguns, but was stopped before more people could be injured. This tragic incident comes just a week after a similar attack in Texas that killed ten people. Noblesville, a town of about 50,000 people, is now left reeling as investigators work to understand what happened and how to prevent future shootings. Many have expressed their prayers and thoughts for the victims and the community, while also calling for an end to the national crisis of school shootings and the fear they instill in students and parents alike.
