SUMMARY: A male student was taken into custody after a shooting incident at an Indiana middle school that left a teacher and a student critically injured. The suspect, who has not been identified, was tackled by a science teacher who swatted a gun out of his hand. Authorities declined to name the suspect and victims but confirmed that the families of the injured have been notified. The situation was resolved quickly, thanks to the brave actions of the teacher and a resource officer who was present at the time. Following the shooting, politicians took to Twitter to share their thoughts and prayers for the victims, with Vice President Mike Pence thanking the swift response of law enforcement and first responders. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and authorities are monitoring a threat directed at the high school. The community is praying for the safety of everyone involved during this difficult time. The Indiana State Teachers Association has called for an end to the national crisis of school shootings, asking when enough is enough. This tragic incident comes just a week after a similar attack in Texas that took the lives of ten people.
END OF SUMMARY.
