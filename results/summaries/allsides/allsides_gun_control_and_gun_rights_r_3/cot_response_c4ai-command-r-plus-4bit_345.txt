SUMMARY:
A male student was taken into custody after a shooting incident at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana, which left a student and a teacher critically injured. Authorities declined to identify the suspect and victims, but confirmed there was no further threat to the school. The suspect excused himself from class and returned with handguns, but the situation was quickly resolved as a teacher reportedly tackled him to the ground. The teacher and student injured in the shooting were hospitalized, and their families have been notified. Noblesville Police Chief Kevin Jowitt praised the swift response of law enforcement and first responders to the tragic incident. Politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, took to Twitter to express their thoughts and prayers for the victims and the community. The shooting comes just a week after a similar tragedy in Santa Fe, Texas, prompting the Indiana State Teachers Association to ask, "When is enough, enough?" 
END OF SUMMARY.
