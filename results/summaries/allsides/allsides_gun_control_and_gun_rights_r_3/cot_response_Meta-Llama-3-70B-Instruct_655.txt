SUMMARY:
A "terrible" shooting occurred at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana, leaving a student and a teacher "critically injured". Authorities took a male student into custody after the incident. The teacher, identified as Jason Seaman, was shot multiple times and underwent surgery after reportedly tackling the student to stop the shooting. Vice President Mike Pence and other politicians tweeted their thoughts, with Pence saying he was "praying for the victims" and thanking law enforcement and first responders for their "swift response". The Indiana State Teachers Association released a statement asking "When is enough, enough?" in response to the "unconscionable" act of violence. The community is left "worried" and "scared" after the incident, which comes just a week after a similar attack in Texas. END OF SUMMARY.
