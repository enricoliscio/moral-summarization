Okay, I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing. The user provided a list of morally framed words, so I should make sure to include as many as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to get the main points. A male student was detained after a shooting at an Indiana middle school, injuring a teacher and student. The suspect had two handguns and the situation was resolved quickly. A teacher tackled the shooter, saving others. The community is praying and expressing support. Law enforcement and agencies are investigating. The incident happened a week after another school attack.

Now, I need to structure the summary. Start with the shooting, injuries, and the suspect. Then mention the teacher's brave action. Include the quick resolution and the lack of metal detectors but presence of a resource officer. Highlight the community's response with prayers and support. Note the ongoing investigation and the call for responsibility to prevent such incidents. End with the impact on the community and the proximity to another attack.

I should use words like "shooting," "injured," "threat," "incident," "investigating," "praying," "tragedy," "difficult," "affected," "safe," "violence," "crisis," "responsibility," etc. Keep it concise, under 200 words.

Let me draft it step by step, making sure each key point is covered and the moral words are included.
