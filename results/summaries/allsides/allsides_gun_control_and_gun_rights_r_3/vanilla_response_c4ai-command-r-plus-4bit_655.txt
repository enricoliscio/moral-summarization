SUMMARY: A shooting at Noblesville West Middle School in Indiana left a teacher and a student critically injured on Friday. A male student was taken into custody as the suspect. The suspect allegedly excused himself from class and returned with two handguns, opening fire and injuring the victims. A science teacher reportedly tackled the student and swatted a gun out of his hand, preventing further injuries. Authorities have not released the identities of the suspect or victims. The shooting comes just a week after a similar incident in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed eight students and two teachers. Noblesville's middle school has about 1,300 students, and the city is located about 20 miles from Indianapolis. The incident has prompted politicians and public figures to call for prayers and support for the victims and the community. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has offered state resources to assist local law enforcement in their investigation.
