SUMMARY:

The Trump Administration's response to the Michael Flynn resignation has followed a familiar pattern, reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's handling of the Watergate scandal. Instead of addressing the underlying issues, the White House has chosen to focus on the "low-life leakers" and has threatened to pursue them criminally. This approach is misguided and likely to backfire, as history has shown that trying to stop leaks leads to blame-shifting, low morale, and eventually, political abandonment by Congress. The President's tweets and comments have only served to escalate the situation, with the White House now launching a witch hunt for leakers. This has led to a cycle of blame and intimidation, with the latest development being a memo from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning against leaking, which was promptly leaked itself. The moral of the story is that the Trump Administration's obsession with leaks is a misguided attempt to suppress the truth, and will ultimately lead to its own downfall.

END OF SUMMARY.
