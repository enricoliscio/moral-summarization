SUMMARY:

The Trump Administration's handling of leaks has taken a familiar and ominous turn, reminiscent of the Nixon era's Plumbers unit. After National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's resignation, the White House has focused on blaming leakers instead of addressing the underlying issues. President Trump has tweeted threats to catch leakers, and his administration has launched an investigation into the leaks, invoking the power of the Justice Department. However, history shows that such efforts often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment by Congress. The administration's reaction to the leaks has been heavy-handed, with the president chastising the FBI and demanding they find the leakers. This has raised concerns about the birth of a new Plumbers unit, which could lead to a "Leak Apocalypse." The article warns that the Trump Administration's approach will only lead to more leaks and a further erosion of trust. END OF SUMMARY.
