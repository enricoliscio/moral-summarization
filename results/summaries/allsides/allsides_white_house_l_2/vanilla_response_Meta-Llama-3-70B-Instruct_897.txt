SUMMARY:

The article discusses the leaks surrounding former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's phone call with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, which led to Flynn's resignation. President Trump has vowed to catch the leakers, but history suggests that this will be a futile effort. The article warns that the White House's approach to dealing with leaks, including threatening criminal charges, will only lead to more leaks, low morale, and eventually, political abandonment by Congress. The article draws parallels with the Nixon Administration's handling of leaks during the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to President Nixon's resignation. The article concludes that the Trump Administration's efforts to stop leaks will be unsuccessful, and that the power of leaks in Washington will only continue to grow.
