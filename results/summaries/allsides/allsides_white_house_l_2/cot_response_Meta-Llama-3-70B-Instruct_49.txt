SUMMARY:
The Washington rules of engagement remain unchanged, and the weaponized leak always gets through. President Trump's tweet about "low-life leakers" and his prediction that they will be caught is unlikely to come true, as history shows that trying to close off leaks leads to blame-shifting, low morale, resignations, and political abandonment by Congress. The White House's reaction to the Flynn fiasco, treating leakers as the problem, is reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's approach, which led to the infamous Watergate scandal. The president's warning about "criminal leaks" and his invocation of the power of the new Attorney General to stop leaks is a marker of the probable birth of the New Plumbers. The Trump Administration's quest to stop leaks is futile, as evidenced by the immediate leak of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaking. END OF SUMMARY.
