SUMMARY: The resignation of Michael Flynn, President Trump's former National Security Advisor, due to leaked information about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak set off a chain of events that mirrored the infamous Watergate scandal. President Trump and his administration chose to focus on the leakers as the main problem, with the president even calling for the Justice Department to investigate the leaks as criminal acts. However, history has shown that attempts to stop leaks often lead to counterproductive outcomes, as demonstrated by the Nixon administration's creation of the "Plumbers" during the Pentagon Papers leak. Despite the administration's efforts, leaks continue to occur, as evidenced by the recent revelation that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus contacted the FBI about Russia. President Trump's criticism of the FBI's handling of leaks further underscores the administration's intent to crack down on leakers, potentially leading to a new wave of "Plumbers". Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning staff against leaking was ironically leaked itself, highlighting the futility of the administration's efforts.
END OF SUMMARY.
