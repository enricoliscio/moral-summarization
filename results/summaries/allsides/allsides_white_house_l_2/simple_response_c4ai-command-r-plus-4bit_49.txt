SUMMARY: Leaks about Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak led to the first major shakeup in the Trump administration and highlighted the persistent issue of leaks in Washington. President Trump vowed to catch the leakers, but history suggests that such efforts are often futile and can lead to counterproductive outcomes, as seen in the Watergate scandal. The White House's focus on treating leakers as the problem and invoking the power of the Justice Department echo the Nixon administration's response to leaks. However, the record shows that prosecuting leakers is difficult and can backfire. Despite the Trump administration's efforts, leaks continue, including one involving Reince Priebus' contact with the FBI about Russia. The White House's reaction to the leak, including the president's public criticism of the FBI, indicates a misguided approach that may result in further entanglements. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaking was ironically leaked, underscoring the futility of the administration's quest. The struggle against leaks continues, but it is unlikely to be successful, given the entrenched nature of leaking in Washington.
END OF SUMMARY.
