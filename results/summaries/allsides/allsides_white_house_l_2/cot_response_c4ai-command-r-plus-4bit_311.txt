SUMMARY:
The resignation of Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor and the subsequent leaks about his communications with Russia's ambassador have revealed that the rules of engagement in Washington remain unchanged. President Trump has threatened leakers with criminal prosecution, but history shows that such attempts to stop leaks only lead to blame-shifting, low morale, resignations, and political abandonment. The Nixon administration's response to the Pentagon Papers leak, which involved creating a team of "plumbers" to stop leaks, ultimately led to the infamous Watergate scandal and Nixon's resignation. The Trump administration's response to the Flynn leak, including the president's recent tweets chastising the FBI for its inability to stop leaks, suggests that a new team of "plumbers" may be forming. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memorandum warning staff against leaking was itself leaked, underscoring the futility of the administration's quest to stop leaks. The White House's focus on treating leakers as the problem could lead to a Nixonian scenario of Leak Apocalypse, with low morale and resignations following attempts to stop leaks. END OF SUMMARY.
