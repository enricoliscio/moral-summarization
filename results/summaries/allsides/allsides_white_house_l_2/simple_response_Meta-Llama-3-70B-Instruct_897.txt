SUMMARY:

The article highlights the Trump Administration's misguided approach to dealing with leaks, drawing parallels with the Nixon Administration's failed attempts to plug leaks during the Watergate scandal. Despite history showing that trying to stop leaks leads to blame-shifting, low morale, and resignations, the White House is pursuing a similar path. President Trump's tweets and comments indicate a focus on catching leakers, with the Justice Department being tasked to investigate. However, the article argues that leaks are not criminal and that pursuing leakers will only lead to more leaks. The White House's reaction to the Priebus-FBI leak and the subsequent tweets by the President demonstrate a Nixonian scenario of Leak Apocalypse. The article concludes that the Trump Administration's quest to stop leaks is futile, as evidenced by the immediate leak of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaking.

END OF SUMMARY.
