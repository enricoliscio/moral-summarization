SUMMARY: The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaks about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak set off a chain of events that revealed the Trump administration's misapprehension of the Washington rules of engagement. President Trump vowed to catch the leakers, but history shows that such threats are futile and often lead to further blame-shifting, low morale, and resignations. The White House's response mirrored the infamous Watergate scandal, where President Nixon's attempts to plug leaks resulted in the creation of the Plumbers, a group of volunteer burglars who conducted illegal break-ins. Despite the administration's efforts, the leaks continued, and the focus on stopping them only led to further problems. The Trump administration followed a similar path, with the president invoking the power of the Justice Department to stop the leaks and even chastising the FBI for its inability to do so. However, as seen in the past, leaks are not easily criminalized, and the pursuit of leakers often leads to more entanglements and doubts about competence. The leaked memo from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, warning staff against leaking, only highlighted the futility of the administration's quest. The White House's reaction to the Priebus-to-FBI-about-Russia leak further confirmed their misguided approach to the issue. The Nixon administration's struggle with leaks and its eventual downfall serve as a cautionary tale for the Trump administration's attempt to plug the leaks.
END OF SUMMARY.
