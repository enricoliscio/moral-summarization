Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it first to understand the main points. The article talks about leaks related to Michael Flynn and how they affected the Trump administration. It compares the situation to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal, where leaks led to Plumbers being formed. The article mentions that trying to stop leaks often leads to more problems, like blame-shifting and resignations. It also notes that prosecuting leakers is rare and doesn't solve the issue, as seen with the Obama administration. The White House's response, including Trump's tweets and Tillerson's memo, ends up being leaked, showing the futility of their efforts. The summary needs to capture these key points concisely, under 200 words.
