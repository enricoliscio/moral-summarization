SUMMARY: The resignation of Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, due to leaks about his interactions with the Russian Ambassador, has triggered a familiar response from the White House. Instead of focusing on the overwhelming task of creating a new government, the administration has chosen to treat the leakers as the problem, invoking criminal investigations and threatening repercussions. This approach mirrors the infamous Watergate scandal, where President Nixon's attempts to plug leaks led to a series of unfortunate events and his eventual resignation. The Trump Administration's response, including the president's lengthy press conference and tweets chastising law enforcement, indicates the birth of a new set of "Plumbers," tasked with stopping the leaks. However, history shows that leaks are not easily stopped and that the pursuit of leakers often leads to low morale and political abandonment. The futility of the administration's quest is highlighted by the fact that even the memo warning against leaking was immediately leaked. The White House's misguided focus on the leakers, rather than on the act of leaking, sets a dangerous precedent and indicates that the Leak Apocalypse has only just begun.
END OF SUMMARY.
