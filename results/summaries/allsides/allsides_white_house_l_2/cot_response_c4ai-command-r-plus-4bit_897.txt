SUMMARY:
The resignation of Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, has brought to light the persistent issue of leaks in Washington, with President Trump condemning the "low-life leakers." History shows that attempts to curb leaking often result in blame-shifting, low morale, and resignations, as seen in the Watergate scandal. The White House's response to the Flynn incident, however, has been to focus on the leakers as the primary issue, with the president even suggesting the creation of a new team to tackle the problem. This approach mirrors the Nixon administration's response to the Pentagon Papers leak, which ultimately led to their downfall. President Trump's threats of criminal prosecution for leakers and his invocation of the Justice Department's power may be bluster, but they also indicate a potential Nixonian descent into Leak Apocalypse. The leaking of Reince Priebus' contact with the FBI and the subsequent presidential tweets chastising the FBI further reinforce this. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memorandum warning staff against leaking was ironically leaked, highlighting the futility of the administration's attempts to stem the tide of leaks.
END OF SUMMARY.
