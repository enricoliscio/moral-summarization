SUMMARY: The resignation of Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, due to leaks about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, has set off a chain of events that mirror the infamous Watergate scandal. President Trump has threatened to catch the "low-life leakers," but history shows that such efforts often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. The White House's focus on treating the leakers as the problem, rather than regaining balance and moving forward, echoes the Nixon Administration's creation of the "Plumbers," who unsuccessfully tried to stop leaks through illegal means. Despite the president's warnings and the invocation of the Justice Department's power, leaks have continued unabated, with the recent leak about Reince Priebus' contact with the FBI causing further embarrassment for the administration. The president's frustration with the FBI's inability to stop the leaks and his order to "FIND NOW" suggest that the New Plumbers are already at work, but their quest to stop the leaks is likely futile, as demonstrated by the immediate leaking of Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaks. The struggle against leaks in Washington continues, but the Trump Administration's approach may lead to a Leak Apocalypse, similar to Watergate.
END OF SUMMARY.
