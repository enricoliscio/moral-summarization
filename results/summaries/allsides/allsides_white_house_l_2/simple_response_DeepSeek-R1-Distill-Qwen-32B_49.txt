Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. The user wants me to preserve the moral framing that the author gave. Hmm, let me read through the article first.

The article talks about Michael Flynn's resignation and how leaks led to that. It compares the Trump administration's response to the Nixon administration during Watergate. The author is critical of Trump's approach, saying that trying to stop leaks usually backfires and leads to more problems, like in Nixon's case. They mention how Nixon created the Plumbers to stop leaks, which ended up causing more issues. Now, Trump is threatening to do something similar, which the author sees as a mistake.

I should make sure the summary captures that the administration's focus on leaks is counterproductive and similar to past failures. Also, the part where Tillerson's memo was leaked immediately shows the futility of their efforts. I need to highlight the moral judgment that pursuing leakers isn't effective and could lead to more problems.

Let me structure the summary: Start with the Flynn resignation and the leaks. Then compare to Nixon. Mention Trump's threats and the inevitable failure. End with the leaked memo showing the issue's persistence. Keep it under 200 words and make sure the moral framing is clear.

Wait, did I include all the key points? Flynn, leaks, comparison to Nixon, Trump's actions, the memo, and the conclusion about futility. Yeah, that should cover it. Let me make sure it's concise and flows well.

SUMMARY: The article discusses how leaks about Michael Flynn’s interactions with the Russian ambassador led to his resignation and comparisons to the Nixon administration’s handling of leaks during Watergate. The author criticizes the Trump administration for treating leakers as the problem, arguing that such efforts often backfire, as seen in Nixon’s creation of the Plumbers, who caused more damage. Trump’s threats to pursue leakers criminally and his dismissal of the FBI’s ability to stop leaks echo Nixon’s failed strategies. The article highlights the futility of targeting leakers, as shown by the Obama administration’s record of leak investigations and the immediate leak of Tillerson’s anti-leak memo. The moral framing emphasizes that pursuing leakers risks political collapse and distracts from addressing broader issues. END OF SUMMARY.
