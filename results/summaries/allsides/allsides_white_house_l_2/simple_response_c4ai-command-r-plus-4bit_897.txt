SUMMARY: The resignation of Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, triggered by leaks revealing his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, highlights the persistent issue of leaks in Washington politics. President Trump has vowed to catch the leakers, drawing comparisons to Nixon's pursuit of leakers during the Watergate scandal, which ultimately failed and led to Nixon's resignation. The White House's focus on treating leakers as the problem and invoking the power of the Attorney General to investigate leaks follows a familiar pattern. However, history shows that leaks are not easily criminalized and that pursuing leakers often leads to further entanglements and doubts about competence. Despite the Trump Administration's efforts, leaks continue, including one involving Chief of Staff Reince Priebus' irregular contact with the FBI, which prompted the president to publicly chastise the FBI's inability to stop leaks. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaking was ironically leaked itself, underscoring the futility of the administration's quest. This pattern of leaks and the administration's response suggests that we are witnessing the early days of a "Leak Apocalypse," with the White House misapprehending the nature of the struggle ahead.
END OF SUMMARY.
