SUMMARY: The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaked information about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak set off a chain of events that revealed the Trump administration's misguided approach to dealing with leaks. President Trump and his Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, focused on treating leakers as the problem, threatening to catch and prosecute them. However, history has shown that such efforts are futile, as exemplified by the Watergate scandal and the Nixon administration's creation of the "Plumbers." Despite invoking the power of the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and the Justice Department, the Trump administration's attempts to stop leaks will likely be unsuccessful, as leaking accurate government information has never resulted in prosecution for reporters or publishers. The administration's misguided pursuit of leakers mirrors the Nixon White House's futile attempts to plug the leaks, ultimately leading to low morale and political abandonment. The leaking of a memo by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, warning staff against leaking, underscores the futility of the administration's quest. The White House's reaction to the Priebus-FBI leak further demonstrates their failure to understand the true nature of the struggle ahead, with the president publicly chastising the FBI for their inability to stop leaks. This indicates the beginning of a "Leak Apocalypse," mirroring the Watergate scandal, as the administration desperately tries to plug the leaks.
END OF SUMMARY.
