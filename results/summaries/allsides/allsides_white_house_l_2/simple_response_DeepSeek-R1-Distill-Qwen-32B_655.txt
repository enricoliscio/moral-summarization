Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully first. The article talks about the recent events involving Michael Flynn and the leaks in the Trump administration. It compares the current situation to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal, highlighting how leaks have led to similar issues.

The main points are that leaks are a common issue in Washington, leading to problems like blame-shifting and low morale. The article mentions that the Trump administration is taking a hard line against leakers, similar to Nixon's Plumbers. However, history shows that prosecuting leakers doesn't stop leaks; it just creates more problems.

The article also points out that the Obama administration tried to stop leaks but ended up with negative consequences. The Trump administration's efforts, like Tillerson's memo, are likely to fail because the leaks keep happening despite their actions.

So, the summary should capture the comparison to Watergate, the futility of trying to stop leaks, and the historical context showing that such efforts don't work. I need to make sure the moral framing is preserved, emphasizing the inevitable nature of leaks and the administration's ineffective response.

I'll structure the summary to first mention the Flynn leaks and their impact, then compare to Watergate, discuss the administration's approach, and conclude with the historical futility of stopping leaks. Keeping it under 200 words is important, so I'll be concise.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing issue of leaks in the Trump administration, particularly following the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. It draws parallels to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal, highlighting how leaks have historically led to blame-shifting, low morale, and political fallout. President Trump has vowed to pursue leakers, likening them to Nixon's "Plumbers," but history shows that such efforts often fail and instead exacerbate the problem. The article notes that while prosecuting leakers is rare and ineffective, the Obama administration set a record with ten leak investigations, which backfired by entangling the White House in controversy. Similarly, Trump's administration, by treating leakers as the problem, risks following Nixon's path of political decline. Tillerson's leaked memo warning against leaks underscores the futility of such measures, as leaks persist despite efforts to stop them. The article concludes that the administration's approach is likely to repeat historical patterns of failure, with leaks continuing to undermine governance. END OF SUMMARY.
