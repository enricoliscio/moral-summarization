SUMMARY:

The article highlights the futile efforts of the Trump Administration to stop leaks in Washington, drawing parallels with the Nixon Administration's failed attempts to plug leaks during the Watergate scandal. Despite President Trump's warnings and vows to catch leakers, history suggests that such efforts will only lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment by Congress. The article argues that the White House has misapprehended the struggle ahead, treating leakers as the problem instead of addressing the underlying issues. The President's invocation of the Attorney General's power to stop leaks is seen as a futile attempt, as leaks are not criminal and have never led to successful prosecutions. The article concludes that the Trump Administration is heading down a similar path as the Nixon Administration, with the President's tweets chastising the FBI and ordering them to "FIND NOW" being seen as a warning sign of a looming "Leak Apocalypse."
