SUMMARY:

The Trump Administration's response to leaks about National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's phone call with Russia Ambassador Sergei Kislyak has led to a familiar scenario: blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. President Trump's tweets threatening to catch the "low-life leakers" and his invocation of the Justice Department to investigate the leaks are reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's failed attempts to plug leaks, which ultimately led to the Watergate scandal. The White House's misapprehension of the struggle ahead will likely lead to a futile quest to stop the leaks, which will only result in further leaks and a breakdown in trust. The administration's treatment of leakers as the problem, rather than addressing the underlying issues, will only exacerbate the situation. The recent leak about Chief of Staff Reince Priebus's contact with the FBI and the president's subsequent tweets chastising the FBI for being "totally unable" to stop the leaks have set the stage for a Nixonian scenario of Leak Apocalypse.

END OF SUMMARY.
