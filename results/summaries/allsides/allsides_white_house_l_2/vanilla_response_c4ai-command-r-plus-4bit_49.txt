SUMMARY: The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaked information about his communications with the Russian ambassador sets a precedent for the Trump administration's response to leaks. President Trump has vowed to crack down on leakers, comparing them to "low-life" and instructing the Justice Department to investigate. However, history shows that attempts to stop leaks often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. The Nixon administration's pursuit of leaks during the Watergate scandal ultimately led to Nixon's resignation. The Trump administration's response to the Flynn leak, including the president's recent criticism of the FBI's handling of leaks, indicates a similar path of self-destruction. Despite the appointment of new cabinet members and the threat of criminal prosecution, leaks continue, as demonstrated by the recent leak of a memo from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning staff against leaking. The power of the Washington leaker and the futility of the Trump administration's efforts to stop them are highlighted by the immediate leak of Tillerson's memo.
END OF SUMMARY.
