SUMMARY:
The Trump Administration's response to leaks about National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's phone call with Russia Ambassador Sergei Kislyak has followed a familiar, yet "low-life" and "boneheaded" path. Instead of addressing the issue, the White House has chosen to blame the "leakers", with President Trump tweeting that they will be caught and predicting a "criminal" investigation. However, history shows that such efforts lead to "blame-shifting", "low morale", and "resignations". The administration's reaction is reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's "creepy" and "sad-sack" attempts to stop leaks, which ultimately led to the Watergate scandal. The Trump Administration's "chastisement" of law enforcement and "alarm" over leaks has only led to more leaks, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo against leaking being immediately leaked. It seems that the White House has misapprehended the struggle ahead and is heading towards a "Leak Apocalypse".
END OF SUMMARY.
