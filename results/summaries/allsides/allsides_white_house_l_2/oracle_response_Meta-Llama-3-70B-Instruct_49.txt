SUMMARY:

The Washington leaks continue to plague the Trump Administration, leading to the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Despite President Trump's vows to "catch" the leakers, history suggests that such efforts will only lead to "abandonment" by Congress and a cycle of blame-shifting and low morale. The White House's decision to "treat" the leakers as the problem, rather than addressing the underlying issues, is reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's failed attempts to "stop" leaks, which ultimately led to the president's resignation.

The Trump Administration's "quest" to control the leaks has only led to more leaks, including the revelation that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus irregularly contacted the FBI. The president's tweets chastising the FBI for their inability to "find" the leakers and his order to "FIND NOW" suggest a Nixonian scenario of "leak apocalypse." The administration's efforts to "regain" balance and move forward are being undermined by their own actions.

END OF SUMMARY.
