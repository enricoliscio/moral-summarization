SUMMARY:

The article discusses the leaks surrounding Michael Flynn's resignation as National Security Advisor and the Trump Administration's response to it. Despite President Trump's claims that leakers will be caught, history suggests that they rarely are. The article warns that the Administration's approach to dealing with leaks, including invoking the power of the Attorney General, may lead to a repeat of the Nixon Administration's mistakes, including the creation of a "Plumbers" unit to stop leaks. The article cites examples of how past administrations have failed to stop leaks, including the Obama Administration's record number of investigations against leakers. The article concludes that the Trump Administration's approach will likely lead to more leaks and a further erosion of trust.

END OF SUMMARY.
