SUMMARY: The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaked information regarding his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak set off a chain of events that revealed the Trump administration's misguided approach to dealing with leaks. Instead of focusing on the tasks at hand, the administration chose to emulate the Nixon White House and target leakers as the primary issue. President Trump's threats of criminal prosecution and his invocation of the new Attorney General failed to deter leaks and instead invited comparisons to the infamous Watergate scandal. The White House's attempts to suppress leaks mirrored the creation of the "Plumbers" during the Nixon era, a group tasked with plugging leaks but ultimately responsible for the Watergate break-in. Despite the administration's efforts, leaks continued unabated, with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus' contact with the FBI being exposed. Trump's public criticism of the FBI's handling of leaks and his call for action further fueled the fire, leading to speculation about the formation of a new group of "Plumbers." Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning staff against leaking was ironically leaked, underscoring the futility of the administration's approach. The Trump administration's response to leaks followed a familiar and morally questionable path, repeating the mistakes of the past and failing to recognize the enduring power of Washington leakers.
END OF SUMMARY.
