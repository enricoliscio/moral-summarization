SUMMARY:
The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaks about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak sets the stage for a new Watergate-style scandal. The Trump administration's response to the leaks, including the president's threats to catch leakers and his invocation of the Justice Department, echoes Nixon's futile attempts to plug the leaks with the creation of the "Plumbers". History shows that trying to stop leaks leads to blame-shifting, low morale, and resignations. Despite the administration's efforts, the leaks continue, with the recent revelation that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus contacted the FBI about Russia being a case in point. The president's public chastisement of the FBI for its inability to stop leaks and his call for an investigation by the Justice Department are ominous signs of a Nixonian "Leak Apocalypse". The futility of the administration's quest is highlighted by the fact that even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaking was immediately leaked. The struggle against leaks in Washington is a losing battle, and the Trump administration's attempts to control information may only lead to further embarrassment and political abandonment.
END OF SUMMARY.
