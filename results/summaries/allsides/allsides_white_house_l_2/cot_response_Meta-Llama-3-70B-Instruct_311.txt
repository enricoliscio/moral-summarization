SUMMARY:
The Trump Administration's handling of leaks has taken a Nixonian turn, with President Trump vowing to catch the "low-life leakers" who revealed National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's conversations with Russia's ambassador. However, history shows that such efforts often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment by Congress. The White House's reaction to the leaks has been "boneheaded," with Trump invoking the power of the new Attorney General to stop the leaks, which is unlikely to work. The administration's "criminal" pursuit of leakers has drawn comparisons to the Nixon Administration's "Plumbers" unit, which led to the Watergate scandal. The president's "alarming" tweets and "imperative" orders to the FBI to find the leakers have only led to further leaks, including a memo from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning against leaking. The Trump Administration's quest to stop leaks appears futile, and its approach is reminiscent of the "leak apocalypse" of the Nixon era. END OF SUMMARY.
