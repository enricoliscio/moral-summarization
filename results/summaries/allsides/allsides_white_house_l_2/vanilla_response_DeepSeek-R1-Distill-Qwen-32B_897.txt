Alright, I need to summarize this article about the Flynn resignation and its implications. The user wants a concise summary of no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article discusses how leaks about Michael Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador led to his resignation and compared it to past scandals like Watergate. It mentions President Trump's response, vowing to catch the leakers, but history shows leaks are hard to stop.

I should note that the White House's approach to leaks, similar to Nixon's Plumbers, might backfire. The article also points out that prosecuting leakers is rare and ineffective, as seen during the Obama administration with cases like Manning, Assange, and Snowden.

Additionally, the article highlights the recent developments, like Priebus contacting the FBI and Tillerson's leaked memo, showing the ongoing issue. I need to convey that the Trump administration's efforts to stop leaks could lead to more problems, similar to Nixon's downfall.

I'll structure the summary to include these elements: the Flynn leak's impact, comparison to Watergate, the futility of stopping leaks, historical examples, and the current administration's ineffective strategies. Keeping it under 200 words and ensuring clarity.

SUMMARY: The article discusses how leaks about Michael Flynn's conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak led to Flynn's resignation and sparked comparisons to the Watergate scandal. President Trump vowed to catch the leakers, but history shows leaks in Washington are often uncontrollable. The article highlights how attempts to stop leaks, like Nixon's "Plumbers," backfired, leading to political downfall. Trump's administration, by treating leakers as the problem, risks repeating Nixon's mistakes. Leaks are rarely prosecuted, and even when they are, they often fail to stop the flow of information. The Obama administration's record of leak investigations, including cases like Manning, Assange, and Snowden, shows that such efforts often harm the administration's reputation. The article concludes that Trump's focus on leaks, including Priebus's contact with the FBI and Tillerson's leaked memo, indicates a futile effort to control the situation, mirroring Nixon's failed strategies. END OF SUMMARY.
