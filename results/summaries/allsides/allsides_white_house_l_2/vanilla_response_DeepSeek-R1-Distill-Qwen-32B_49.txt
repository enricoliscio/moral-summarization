Alright, I need to summarize this article about leaks in the Trump administration and their comparison to the Nixon era. The user wants a concise summary, no more than 200 words, so I should focus on the key points.

First, the article discusses how leaks about Michael Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador led to his resignation and a shakeup in the administration. It's highlighting that Washington's leak culture hasn't changed. President Trump vowed to catch the leakers, but historically, they rarely get caught. The piece draws parallels to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal, where attempts to stop leaks led to more problems.

I should mention the creation of the "Plumbers" by Nixon, which backfired. Now, the Trump administration is considering similar actions, referred to as the "New Plumbers." The article also notes that prosecuting leakers is difficult and hasn't worked well for past administrations, like Obama's record of investigations without much success.

The summary should include the White House's reaction to leaks, Trump's tweets criticizing the FBI's inability to stop leaks, and the subsequent leak of Tillerson's memo, which shows the futility of their efforts. I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll structure it to cover these main points concisely.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the ongoing issue of leaks in the Trump administration, drawing parallels to the Nixon era. Leaks about Michael Flynn's December conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak led to Flynn's resignation and a shakeup in the administration. President Trump vowed to identify the leakers, but history shows that leaks in Washington often go unchecked. The article compares Trump's approach to Nixon's creation of the "Plumbers," a group tasked with stopping leaks, which ultimately backfired and led to the Watergate scandal. Trump's administration has similarly focused on identifying leakers, with the president criticizing the FBI's inability to stop leaks and demanding action. The article highlights the futility of such efforts, as leaks continue to proliferate, with even Tillerson's anti-leak memo being leaked. The administration's approach risks repeating Nixon's mistakes, leading to blame-shifting, low morale, and political fallout. END OF SUMMARY.
