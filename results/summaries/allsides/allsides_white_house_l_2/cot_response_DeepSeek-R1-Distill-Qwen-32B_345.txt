Alright, I need to tackle this query where the user wants me to act as a news summarizer and moral expert. They provided a detailed news article about leaks in the Trump administration and how it's reminiscent of the Nixon era. The user has specific instructions: first, identify all single words that are morally framed, then summarize the article while preserving those moral terms.

First, I'll start by reading the article carefully. I need to spot words that carry moral connotations. Words like "weaponized," "low-life," "caught," "blame-shifting," "morale," "abandonment," "infamous," "sad-sack," "creepy," "boneheaded," "sank," "resignation," "prosecuted," "intimidation," "entangled," "competence," "bluster," "apocalypse," "permeated," "devastating," "chastisement," "imperative," "futility," "chilled," "robust," "candid," and "leaked" stand out as they carry strong moral judgments.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of these moral terms as possible. I'll focus on the main points: the Flynn resignation, the comparison to Watergate, Trump's response with the Justice Department, the failure of similar past efforts, and the ongoing leaks despite attempts to stop them. I'll ensure the summary reflects the moral framing by using words like "weaponized leaks," "morale," "abandonment," and "futility."

I should also structure the summary to show the parallels between the Trump and Nixon administrations, highlighting the ineffective attempts to control leaks and the inevitable continuation of the problem. This will emphasize the moral issues and the futility of their efforts.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the Flynn incident, moving through the administration's responses, and ending with the ongoing leaks and Tillerson's leaked memo. This should encapsulate the moral framing effectively.

**STEP 1:**

\* weaponized  
\* low-life  
\* caught  
\* blame-shifting  
\* morale  
\* abandonment  
\* infamous  
\* sad-sack  
\* creepy  
\* boneheaded  
\* sank  
\* resignation  
\* prosecuted  
\* intimidation  
\* entangled  
\* competence  
\* bluster  
\* apocalypse  
\* permeated  
\* devastating  
\* chastisement  
\* imperative  
\* futility  
\* chilled  
\* robust  
\* candid  
\* leaked  

**SUMMARY:**  

The article discusses how weaponized leaks in Washington have led to political turmoil, drawing parallels between the Trump administration and the Nixon era. The resignation of Michael Flynn and subsequent leaks have reignited concerns about blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. President Trump vowed to catch the leakers, but history shows such efforts often fail, as leaks grow uncontrollably. The Nixon administration’s creation of the Plumbers to stop leaks backfired, leading to the Watergate scandal. Similarly, Trump’s focus on criminalizing leaks risks repeating Nixon’s mistakes. Despite the new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and the Justice Department’s involvement, leaks persist, as seen in the Priebus-FBI leak. Trump’s tweets criticizing the FBI’s inability to stop leaks and his imperative demand to “FIND NOW” suggest a futile effort to control the flow. Tillerson’s leaked memo warning against leaks highlights the futility of such attempts, as the Washington leaker culture remains unchecked. END OF SUMMARY.
