SUMMARY:

The article discusses the Trump Administration's response to leaks about National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's phone call with Russia Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Despite President Trump's tweets threatening to catch the leakers, history suggests that leaks are a persistent problem in Washington. The article warns that the White House's approach to dealing with leaks, including invoking the power of the Attorney General and threatening criminal prosecution, is misguided and reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's failed efforts to stop leaks during the Watergate scandal. The article suggests that the Trump Administration's efforts to stop leaks will ultimately fail and may even lead to further leaks and political abandonment by Congress. The article concludes by noting that the White House's reaction to leaks, including a memo from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning against leaks, has already been leaked, highlighting the futility of their efforts.

END OF SUMMARY.
