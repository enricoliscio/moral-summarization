SUMMARY: In the wake of the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, President Trump and his administration have chosen to focus on the issue of leaks within the government, threatening a "Leak Apocalypse." Trump has called for investigations into leakers, comparing the situation to the Watergate scandal and invoking the power of the new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, to stop the leaks. However, history has shown that attempts to stop leaks often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. The Obama administration's record-setting ten investigations against leakers did not bring praise or improve perceptions of competence. Despite the risks, the White House continues to threaten leakers, with Trump even chastising the FBI for its inability to stop leaks. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also warned staff against leaking, only to have his memo immediately leaked. The administration's aggressive stance on leaks mirrors the infamous "Plumbers" of the Nixon era, and it remains to be seen whether their efforts will fare any better. 

END OF SUMMARY.
