SUMMARY:

The article discusses the leaks surrounding National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's phone call with Russia Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, which led to his resignation. President Trump tweeted that the leakers would be caught, but history shows that trying to stop leaks leads to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. The article warns that the Trump Administration's approach to leaks is reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's failed attempts to stop leaks, which ultimately led to the Watergate scandal. The president's threats to investigate and prosecute leakers are unlikely to be successful, as leaks are often not criminal and can be difficult to trace. The article concludes that the Trump Administration's efforts to stop leaks will likely fail, and that the leaks will continue to plague the administration.

END OF SUMMARY.
