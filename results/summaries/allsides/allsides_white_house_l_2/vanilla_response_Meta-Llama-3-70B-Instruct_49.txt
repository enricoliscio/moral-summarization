SUMMARY:

The article discusses the Trump Administration's response to leaks about National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's phone call with Russia Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. President Trump tweeted that the leakers would be caught, but history shows that leaks are often unstoppable and can lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment by Congress. The White House's reaction to the leaks is reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's response to the Pentagon Papers, which led to the creation of the "Plumbers" and ultimately to the Watergate scandal. The article suggests that the Trump Administration is following a similar path, with the President invoking the power of the Attorney General to stop leaks and threatening to pursue leakers criminally. However, the article notes that leaks are not always criminal and that pursuing leakers can lead to further entanglement and doubts about competence. The article concludes that the Trump Administration's quest to stop leaks is likely to be futile.

END OF SUMMARY.
