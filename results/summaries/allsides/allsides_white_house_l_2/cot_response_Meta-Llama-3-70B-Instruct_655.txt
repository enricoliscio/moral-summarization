SUMMARY:
The Trump Administration's handling of leaks has drawn comparisons to the Nixon Administration's infamous Watergate scandal. President Trump has vowed to catch the "low-life leakers" responsible for the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, but history suggests that such efforts often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment by Congress. The White House's reaction to the leaks has been criticized as "criminal" and "Nixonian," with the president invoking the power of the Attorney General to stop the leaks. However, the record shows that leaks are not always criminal, and that intimidation tactics rarely work. The administration's quest to stop the leaks has been marked by "bluster" and "futility," with even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaks being immediately leaked. The president's tweets have been seen as a "chastisement" of law enforcement, and the situation has been described as a "leak apocalypse." END OF SUMMARY.
