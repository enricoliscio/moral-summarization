Okay, so I need to summarize this article about leaks in the Trump administration and how they're affecting things. The article starts by talking about Michael Flynn's resignation and how leaks led to that. It compares the situation to Watergate, where Nixon tried to stop leaks but ended up with more problems. The author mentions that President Trump is treating leakers as a big issue, even suggesting criminal charges, but historically, stopping leaks hasn't worked and has led to more issues.

The article also brings up the Obama administration's record on leaks, pointing out that even with more investigations, they didn't stop the leaks. It then talks about the White House's reaction after a leak involving Reince Priebus and the FBI. Trump criticized the FBI for not finding the leakers and ordered them to find them now. Tillerson sent a memo warning about leaks, but that memo got leaked too, showing how futile their efforts are.

I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the main points: the comparison to Watergate, Trump's approach to leaks, historical context, and the failure of attempts to stop leaks. I should also mention the Tillerson memo being leaked as an example of the problem continuing.

SUMMARY: The article discusses how leaks about Michael Flynn's interactions with the Russian ambassador led to his resignation and comparisons to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal. President Trump has vowed to pursue leakers, framing them as criminals, but historical precedent shows such efforts often fail and worsen political crises. The Obama administration also struggled with leaks, with high-profile cases like Edward Snowden highlighting the futility of crackdowns. Trump's criticism of the FBI's inability to stop leaks and his demand to "FIND NOW" suggest a Nixonian approach. The leak of Tillerson's memo warning against leaks further underscores the administration's inability to curb the flow of information, indicating a cycle of leaks and political fallout. END OF SUMMARY.
