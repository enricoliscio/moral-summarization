SUMMARY: In the wake of Michael Flynn's resignation as National Security Advisor, President Trump and his administration have focused on the issue of leaks, threatening to crack down on leakers and even comparing them to criminals. This approach mirrors the infamous Watergate scandal, where President Nixon's attempts to stop leaks led to a series of unfortunate events, ultimately resulting in his resignation. Despite the administration's efforts, leaks continue to plague the White House, with the recent revelation that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus contacted the FBI about Russia being made public. In response, Trump criticized the FBI's handling of leaks and ordered them to find the source. This has led to concerns that the administration is following Nixon's footsteps in creating a new group of "Plumbers," tasked with stopping leaks. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning staff against leaking was ironically also leaked, highlighting the futility of the administration's efforts. The struggle against leaks in Washington continues, with the Trump administration's attempts to control information facing significant challenges.
END OF SUMMARY.
