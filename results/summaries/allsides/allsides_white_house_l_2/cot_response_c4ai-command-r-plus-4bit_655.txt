SUMMARY:
The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the subsequent leaks about his communications with Russia's ambassador have led to the first shakeup of the Trump administration. President Trump has vowed to catch the leakers, but history shows that such efforts are futile and often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. The Nixon administration's attempts to stop leaks during the Watergate scandal only made things worse, as the leaks grew and Nixon eventually resigned. The Trump administration's response to the Flynn leak follows a similar pattern, with the president threatening to treat leakers as criminals and invoking the power of the Justice Department to stop them. However, leaks are not always criminal, and the record shows that trying to intimidate leakers only leads to more leaks. The Obama administration set a record for investigations against leakers, but this did not bring praise or improve its reputation for competence. Now, with the leak that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus contacted the FBI about Russia, the Trump administration seems to be heading down the same path as Nixon, with the president publicly chastising the FBI for its failure to stop leaks. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning staff against leaking was itself leaked, underscoring the futility of the administration's quest to stop leaks.
