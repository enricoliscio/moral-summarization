SUMMARY:

The Trump Administration's handling of leaks has taken a familiar and ominous turn, reminiscent of the Nixon era. After National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's resignation, President Trump vowed to "catch" the leakers, but history suggests that such efforts often lead to "abandonment" by Congress and low morale. Instead of addressing the real issues, the White House is "treating" the leakers as the problem, following in the "damp footsteps" of the Nixon Administration. The president has "invoked" the power of the Justice Department to investigate the leaks, which could lead to the creation of a new "Plumbers" unit. This approach has been tried before, and it has always ended in failure, with leaks continuing to "permeate" the government. The White House's "quest" to stop the leaks is likely to be futile, and its reaction to the latest leak about Chief of Staff Reince Priebus's contact with the FBI has only added to the sense of "devastating" consequences. END OF SUMMARY.
