SUMMARY:

The Trump Administration's handling of leaks has followed a familiar, misguided path. After National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's resignation, the White House chose to treat the leakers as the problem, rather than regaining balance and moving forward. President Trump's tweets and press conference comments indicated a determination to catch the leakers, but history suggests that this approach will only lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and eventually, political abandonment by Congress. The Administration's quest to stop the leaks has been misapprehended, and their actions will likely create a new era of leak-hunting, reminiscent of the Nixon Administration's infamous Plumbers. The President's invocation of the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions will not stop the leaks, as the record shows that leaks are not criminal and intimidation doesn't work. Instead, the White House's reaction will only lead to a cycle of leak-hunting and abandonment. END OF SUMMARY.
