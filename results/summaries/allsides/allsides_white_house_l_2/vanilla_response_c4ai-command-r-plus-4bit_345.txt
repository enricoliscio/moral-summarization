SUMMARY: The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaked information about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak set off a chain of events that mirrored the Watergate scandal. President Trump's attempts to crack down on leakers within his administration and his invocation of the Justice Department echo Nixon's creation of the "Plumbers" unit to plug leaks, which ultimately led to Nixon's resignation. The White House's focus on treating leakers as the problem and Trump's threats of criminal prosecution have not deterred further leaks, as demonstrated by the subsequent revelation of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus' contact with the FBI. Trump's criticism of the FBI's handling of leaks and his call for immediate action indicate the formation of a new "Plumbers" unit. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning staff against leaking was ironically leaked itself, underscoring the futility of the administration's efforts to control information. This episode highlights the enduring power of leakers in Washington and the challenges faced by the Trump administration in managing information flow.
END OF SUMMARY.
