Okay, so I need to summarize this news article about Michael Flynn and the leaking in the Trump administration. The user wants the summary to preserve the moral framing the author used. First, I should read through the article carefully to understand the main points.

The article talks about how leaks about Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador led to his resignation and the administration's shakeup. It compares this to the Nixon administration's handling of leaks during Watergate. The author seems critical of the Trump administration's approach, suggesting they're following in Nixon's footsteps by trying to stop leaks, which might backfire.

I need to highlight the moral implications here. The author is pointing out that pursuing leakers can lead to negative consequences like blame-shifting and loss of support. Also, the article mentions that prosecuting leakers doesn't always work and can harm the administration's reputation. The use of terms like "New Plumbers" and comparisons to Nixon's Plumbers group shows a moral judgment about the administration's methods.

I should also note that the White House's efforts to stop leaks, like Tillerson's memo, ended up being leaked themselves, which undermines their authority. This suggests that trying to control leaks is futile and might even make things worse.

So, the summary should include the key points: Flynn's resignation, comparison to Watergate, the administration's flawed approach to leaks, the futility of pursuing leakers, and the moral judgment against such tactics. I need to make sure the summary is concise, under 200 words, and captures the author's critical stance.

SUMMARY: The article examines the fallout from leaks involving Michael Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador, which led to Flynn's resignation and highlighted the enduring issue of leaks in Washington. The author draws parallels to the Nixon administration's failed attempts to stop leaks during Watergate, suggesting that the Trump administration's efforts to combat leakers are similarly flawed. By invoking the "New Plumbers" and pursuing legal action, the administration risks repeating Nixon's mistakes, including blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment. The article notes that prosecuting leakers is rarely successful and often counterproductive, as leaks persist despite such measures. The White House's focus on punishing leakers, rather than addressing the underlying issues, is criticized as a distraction from its core responsibilities. The author warns that this approach could lead to a "Leak Apocalypse," similar to Nixon's downfall, and underscores the futility of the administration's efforts, as even its own anti-leak memos are leaked. The moral framing emphasizes the dangers of pursuing leakers and the potential for self-destruction in such tactics. END OF SUMMARY.
