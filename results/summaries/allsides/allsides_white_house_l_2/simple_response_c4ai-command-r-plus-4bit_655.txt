SUMMARY: The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaked information regarding his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak set off a chain of events that revealed the Trump administration's misguided approach to dealing with leaks. Instead of focusing on the tasks at hand, the White House fixated on the leakers, echoing the infamous Watergate scandal and Nixon's futile attempts to plug the leaks. Despite Trump's threats of criminal investigations and his criticism of the FBI's handling of the matter, history shows that leaks are nearly impossible to stop and that pursuing leakers often leads to further problems and low morale. The Obama administration's record number of investigations against leakers did not bring praise or improve its reputation for competence. Furthermore, the leaking of a memo from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, warning staff against leaking, only served to underscore the futility of the Trump administration's efforts. The White House's response to the Flynn leak and subsequent leaks indicates a troubling pattern of prioritizing the pursuit of leakers over addressing the pressing issues at hand.
END OF SUMMARY.
