SUMMARY: The resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to leaked information about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak set off a chain of events that revealed the Trump administration's misguided approach to dealing with leaks. Instead of focusing on the overwhelming task of creating a new government, the White House fixated on the leakers as the primary problem. President Trump even threatened to treat leaks as criminal acts and invoked the power of the new Attorney General to stop them. However, history has shown that trying to suppress leaks often leads to blame-shifting, low morale, and resignations. Despite the administration's efforts, the leaking continued, with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus' contact with the FBI being exposed. The president's public criticism of the FBI's inability to stop leaks further underscores the administration's futile quest to control the flow of information. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning staff against leaking was ironically leaked itself, highlighting the power of the Washington leaker. The Trump administration's attempts to catch and punish leakers follow a familiar pattern that has played out in previous administrations, including the infamous Watergate scandal. The White House's misguided focus on leaks and its failure to recognize the futility of its quest sets the stage for a Leak Apocalypse.
END OF SUMMARY.
