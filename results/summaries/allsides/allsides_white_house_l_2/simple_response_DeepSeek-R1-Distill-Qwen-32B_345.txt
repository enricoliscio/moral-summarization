Okay, so I need to summarize this news article while preserving the moral framing the author gave it. The article is about leaks related to Michael Flynn and the Trump administration's response, drawing parallels to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The author is talking about how leaks in Washington are a common issue, especially with Flynn's resignation. Trump's response is similar to Nixon's, with efforts to control leaks leading to more problems. The article mentions the creation of the Plumbers in Nixon's time and how Trump might be doing something similar by involving the Justice Department. 

I need to highlight the moral issues here. The author seems critical of the administration's approach, suggesting it's counterproductive and reminiscent of Nixon. The summary should capture that the administration is mishandling the leaks, possibly leading to more issues, and that pursuing leakers doesn't solve the problem but creates more.

I should also note the specific examples given, like the Pentagon Papers and the Flynn case, to show the historical pattern. The article ends with Tillerson's memo being leaked, showing the futility of their efforts.

Now, I'll structure the summary: start with the Flynn leaks leading to shakeup, compare to Watergate, mention Trump's approach, the historical failure of such methods, and conclude with the moral implication that this approach is ineffective and harmful.

I need to keep it under 200 words, so I'll be concise but make sure to include all key points: the leaks, the administration's response, historical parallels, the moral criticism, and the outcome with Tillerson's memo.

Let me make sure I don't miss any important details. The key points are the leaks leading to Flynn's resignation, Trump's comparison to Nixon, the failure of past attempts to stop leaks, and the ongoing issue with Tillerson's memo being leaked despite efforts. 

I'll avoid getting too bogged down in specifics, focusing on the overall narrative and moral critique. The summary should flow logically from the problem to the administration's response and the inevitable continuation of leaks.

Alright, I think I have a good outline. Now, I'll draft the summary, making sure to include all these elements concisely.

The article discusses the implications of leaks involving Michael Flynn's resignation and the Trump administration's response, drawing parallels to the Nixon administration's handling of the Watergate scandal. The author highlights how attempts to control leaks, such as Nixon's creation of the Plumbers, often lead to more problems, including blame-shifting and political fallout. Trump's approach, involving the Justice Department to investigate leaks, mirrors Nixon's counterproductive methods. The article underscores the futility of pursuing leakers, as evidenced by historical examples like the Pentagon Papers and the recent leak of Tillerson's memo, which was promptly leaked despite efforts to prevent it. The moral critique emphasizes that such approaches not only fail to stop leaks but also damage the administration's credibility, mirroring Nixon's downfall. The summary concludes that the Trump administration's strategy risks repeating past mistakes, highlighting the ongoing challenge of leaks in Washington politics. 

END OF SUMMARY.
