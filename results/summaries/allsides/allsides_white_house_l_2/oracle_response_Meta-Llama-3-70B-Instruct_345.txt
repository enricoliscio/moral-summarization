SUMMARY:

The White House's reaction to the leaks about National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's phone call with Russia Ambassador Sergei Kislyak has led to a familiar scenario, reminiscent of the Watergate scandal. Instead of addressing the issue, the administration is trying to catch the "low-life leakers" and treat them as the problem. This approach will likely lead to blame-shifting, low morale, resignations, and eventually, political abandonment by Congress. The president's warning that leaks are criminal and will be stopped is a misguided attempt to regain balance. History shows that leaks are not easily stopped, and pursuing leakers can lead to further entanglements and doubts about competence.

The White House's misapprehension of the struggle ahead is evident in its invocation of the power of the new Attorney General to stop leaks. The president's tweets chastising the FBI for being unable to stop leakers and his imperative order to "FIND NOW" suggest that the administration is launching a witch hunt. This approach will only lead to further leaks and a never-ending cycle of whack-a-leak. END OF SUMMARY.
