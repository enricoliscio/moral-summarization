Alright, I need to summarize this article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about leaks in the Trump administration, comparing it to Nixon's Watergate scandal. The author uses terms like "caught," "abandonment," and "break-in" to highlight the moral issues.

I should start by identifying the key events: Flynn's resignation, Trump's response, the comparison to Nixon, and the potential consequences. I need to include the morally framed words the author used. I'll make sure to mention the leaks leading to Flynn's resignation and Trump's promise to catch the leakers, even though history shows they usually aren't caught.

Next, I'll note the comparison to Watergate, where Nixon's attempt to stop leaks led to more problems. The article suggests Trump is following a similar path by treating leakers as the problem, which might lead to political downfall. I should include terms like "regain," "creating," and "follow" to maintain the moral tone.

I'll also mention the White House's reaction, the FBI's failure to stop leaks, and Tillerson's leaked memo. The use of "permeated," "devastating," and "find" are important for the moral framing. I need to keep the summary concise, under 200 words, so I'll focus on the main points and the moral implications without getting too detailed.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the leaks and their impact, moving through the comparisons to Nixon, and ending with the ongoing issue of leaks and the administration's futile efforts. I'll make sure to include as many of the specified moral words as possible without making it sound forced.

SUMMARY: Leaks about Michael Flynn's communication with Russia's ambassador led to his resignation and highlighted the enduring issue of leak culture in Washington. President Trump vowed to "catch" the leakers, but history shows such efforts rarely succeed, as leaks proliferate like Disney's "Sorcerer’s Apprentice." The article draws parallels to the Nixon administration, where attempts to stop leaks led to the Watergate scandal, ultimately dooming Nixon. Trump’s approach, focusing on leakers as the problem, risks a similar fate. The White House’s emphasis on criminalizing leaks, with Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department, echoes Nixon’s "Plumbers." However, prosecuting leakers is difficult, as seen under Obama with cases like Manning, Assange, and Snowden. Trump’s frustration with the FBI’s inability to stop leaks and his demand to "FIND NOW" suggest a Nixonian response. Tillerson’s leaked memo warning against leaks further underscores the futility of the administration’s efforts, as leaks persist despite attempts to "stop" them. The moral framing highlights the inevitability of leaks, the futility of crackdowns, and the potential for political "abandonment." END OF SUMMARY.
