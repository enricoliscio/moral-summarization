Okay, I need to summarize this article about leaks in the Trump administration and their implications. The article starts by talking about Michael Flynn's resignation and how leaks led to that. It compares the current administration to Nixon's Watergate scandal, where leaks caused major issues. 

The president, Trump, is mentioned as vowing to catch the leakers, but the article suggests that historically, leaks are hard to stop. It references the Pentagon Papers and the Plumbers, Nixon's team who tried to stop leaks but ended up causing more problems. 

The article also points out that prosecuting leakers isn't straightforward. The Obama administration tried a lot but didn't get much success. The White House under Trump is taking similar steps, possibly creating a new "Plumbers" team. 

Then, there's the part about Priebus contacting the FBI, which was leaked, leading Trump to criticize the FBI's inability to stop leaks. Tillerson's memo against leaking was also leaked, showing the futility of trying to stop leaks. 

The summary needs to capture all these points concisely, highlighting the comparison to Watergate, the ineffectiveness of efforts to stop leaks, and the ongoing issue with leakers. I need to make sure it's under 200 words and flows well. Let me structure it step by step, ensuring each key point is included without getting too detailed.

SUMMARY: The article discusses the impact of leaks in the Trump administration, particularly surrounding Michael Flynn's resignation, and draws parallels to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal. Leaks, often weaponized in Washington, have led to political turmoil, with Trump vowing to catch leakers, a challenge historically proven difficult. The article highlights how Nixon's attempt to stop leaks via the Plumbers backfired, and similar efforts by Trump risk repeating this pattern. Obama's record of leak investigations also failed to deter leaks, with high-profile cases like Manning, Assange, and Snowden. Trump's focus on prosecuting leakers and criticizing the FBI's inability to stop leaks mirrors Nixon's approach, suggesting a potential "Leak Apocalypse." Tillerson's leaked memo warning against leaks underscores the futility of such measures, as leaks persist despite efforts. The article concludes that the Trump administration's struggle with leaks reflects a systemic issue in Washington, reminiscent of past failures. END OF SUMMARY.
