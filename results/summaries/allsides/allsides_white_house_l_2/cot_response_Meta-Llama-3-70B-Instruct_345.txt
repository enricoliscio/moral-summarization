SUMMARY:
The Trump Administration's handling of leaks has taken a familiar and worrying turn. President Trump's tweets threatening to catch "low-life leakers" and his promise to investigate "criminal leaks" echo the Nixon Administration's failed attempts to plug leaks, which ultimately led to the Watergate scandal. The White House's reaction to the Flynn resignation has been to blame the leakers, rather than addressing the underlying issues. This approach has historically led to "blame-shifting, low morale, resignations, and eventually to political abandonment by Congress." The administration's efforts to stop leaks, including the Justice Department's involvement, are reminiscent of the "New Plumbers" of the Nixon era. The president's tweets chastising the FBI and his imperative order to "FIND NOW" suggest a Nixonian scenario of "Leak Apocalypse" is unfolding. The cycle of leaks and attempts to stop them will likely continue, with the latest example being Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's leaked memo warning against leaks. END OF SUMMARY.
