Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided news article while preserving the moral framing as per the author's original text. The user has specified that the summary should include as many of the listed morally framed words as possible. 

First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It discusses the impact of leaks on the Trump administration, comparing it to the Nixon administration's Watergate scandal. The article highlights how the White House's response to leaks mirrors past failures, leading to potential political downfall.

Next, I'll identify the key morally charged words from the author's list that are central to the article's narrative. These include "caught," "abandonment," "breakin," "regain," "creating," "follow," "treat," "look," "leaks," "misapprehended," "invoked," "put," "approved," "act," "stop," "permeated," "given," "devastating," "find," "leaked," "quest."

I need to ensure that the summary captures the essence of the article, emphasizing the moral implications of the administration's handling of leaks. I'll structure the summary to show the comparison between Trump and Nixon, the failure to stop leaks, and the potential consequences.

I'll start by mentioning the leaks involving Flynn and the comparison to Watergate. Then, I'll discuss Trump's response, the creation of the "New Plumbers," and the parallels with Nixon's Plumbers. I'll highlight the White House's misjudgment in focusing on leaks rather than governance, leading to a cycle of blame and morale issues. Finally, I'll conclude with the ongoing leak problem and the administration's futile efforts to control it.

I'll make sure to incorporate the moral words naturally into the summary without forcing them, ensuring the summary is concise and within 200 words. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct, preserving the original moral framing.

SUMMARY: Leaks about Michael Flynn’s interactions with Russia’s ambassador led to his resignation and highlighted the enduring issue of leaks in Washington. President Trump vowed to "catch" the leakers, but history shows leaks often go unchecked, as seen during Watergate. The Nixon administration’s attempt to stop leaks through the Plumbers backfired, leading to political "abandonment." Trump’s administration, like Nixon’s, is "following" a similar path, treating leaks as a "problem" rather than addressing governance. The president invoked the power of the Justice Department to "stop" leaks, but leaks are rarely "criminalized," and pursuing them often backfires. The White House’s "quest" to control leaks has been "misapprehended," with Priebus’s contact with the FBI further "permeating" the issue. Trump’s tweets chastising the FBI and demanding they "find" leakers suggest the New Plumbers are active. Tillerson’s leaked memo warning against leaks underscores the futility of the administration’s efforts, as leaks continue to "devastate" trust and governance. END OF SUMMARY.
