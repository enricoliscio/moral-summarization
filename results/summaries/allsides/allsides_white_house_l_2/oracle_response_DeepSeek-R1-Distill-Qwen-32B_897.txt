Okay, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. It's about the impact of leaks on the Trump administration, comparing it to Nixon's Watergate scandal. The author uses specific morally charged words, so I need to make sure those are included in the summary.

The key points are the leaks involving Flynn, the White House's response, the comparison to Nixon, the creation of the "New Plumbers," and the futility of trying to stop leaks. I should highlight how the administration's actions might lead to negative outcomes, using words like "caught," "abandonment," "break-in," etc.

I need to keep the summary under 200 words and structure it clearly. I'll start by mentioning the leaks leading to Flynn's resignation and the comparison to Watergate. Then, I'll note Trump's threat to catch leakers and the historical context showing leaks aren't stopped easily. Next, I'll talk about the administration's response, the creation of the "New Plumbers," and the failure to stem leaks. Finally, I'll conclude with the comparison to Nixon and the potential consequences.

I should ensure that all the morally framed words are included where appropriate without making the summary too long. I'll make sure the flow is logical and the moral implications are clear.

SUMMARY: Leaks about Michael Flynn's interactions with the Russian ambassador led to his resignation and highlighted the enduring issue of leaks in Washington. President Trump vowed to "catch" the leakers, but history shows that leaks often persist, as seen during the Nixon administration. The White House, under Trump, risked following Nixon's flawed approach by targeting leakers, potentially leading to blame-shifting and political "abandonment." Trump's press conference emphasized the seriousness of leaks, calling them "criminal," and hinted at creating a "New Plumbers" team to address the issue. However, the author notes that prosecuting leakers is rare and ineffective, as seen during the Obama administration. The White House's response to a leak involving Chief of Staff Reince Priebus further deepened the crisis, with Trump criticizing the FBI's inability to "stop" leaks. The administration's efforts to "regain" control were undermined when a memo from Secretary Tillerson warning against leaks was itself leaked, underscoring the futility of their "quest" to end leaks. The situation mirrors the Nixonian "Leak Apocalypse," suggesting a long, challenging battle ahead. END OF SUMMARY.
