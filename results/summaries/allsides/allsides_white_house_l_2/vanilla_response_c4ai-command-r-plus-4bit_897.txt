SUMMARY: The resignation of Michael Flynn, President Trump's former National Security Advisor, due to leaked information about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, highlights the persistent issue of leaks in Washington politics. Despite President Trump's vow to catch leakers, history suggests otherwise, with the Watergate scandal serving as a prime example of how attempts to plug leaks often lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and resignations. The Trump administration's response to the Flynn incident echoes Nixon's response to the Pentagon Papers leak, which ultimately resulted in the Watergate break-in and Nixon's resignation. The White House's focus on treating leakers as the problem and invoking the power of the Justice Department to investigate leaks may lead to the creation of a new "Plumbers" unit. However, past administrations have shown that pursuing leakers is often futile and can backfire, as seen in the Obama administration's pursuit of Manning, Assange, and Snowden. The recent leak about Chief of Staff Reince Priebus' contact with the FBI and President Trump's subsequent criticism of the FBI's handling of leaks indicate that the administration is doubling down on its anti-leak efforts. This approach may lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of leaks and blame, similar to the Watergate scandal. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's leaked memo warning staff against leaking underscores the challenge the administration faces in its battle against leaks.
END OF SUMMARY.
