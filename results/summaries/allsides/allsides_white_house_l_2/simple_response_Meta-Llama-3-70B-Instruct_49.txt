SUMMARY:

The article highlights the futility of the Trump Administration's efforts to stop leaks in Washington, citing the historical precedent of the Watergate scandal. Despite President Trump's vows to catch leakers, history shows that such efforts lead to blame-shifting, low morale, and political abandonment by Congress. The article warns that the White House's reaction to the Flynn resignation, treating leakers as the problem, will only lead to a "Leak Apocalypse." The president's tweets and comments, including his call for the Justice Department to investigate leaks, are seen as a warning sign of a Nixonian scenario. The article concludes that the Trump Administration's quest to stop leaks is futile, as evidenced by the immediate leak of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's memo warning against leaking. The author argues that leaks are a natural part of Washington politics and that trying to stop them will only lead to further chaos and incompetence.
