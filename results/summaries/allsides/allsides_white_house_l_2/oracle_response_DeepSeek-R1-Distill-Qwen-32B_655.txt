Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the given news article while preserving the moral framing words provided. First, I'll read through the article to understand the main points. The article discusses how leaks about Michael Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador led to his resignation and comparisons to the Nixon administration's handling of leaks during Watergate. It mentions President Trump's threats to catch the leakers and the historical context where such efforts often fail, leading to more problems like low morale and political abandonment.

I should identify the key moral terms from the author's list: caught, abandonment, breakin, regain, creating, follow, treat, look, leaks, misapprehended, invoked, put, approved, act, stop, permeated, given, devastating, find, leaked, quest. I need to include as many of these as possible in the summary without making it too long.

I'll start by outlining the main events: Flynn's resignation, Trump's response, historical parallels with Nixon, the creation of "Plumbers," and the failure of such efforts. I'll make sure to use the moral terms where appropriate, like "caught," "abandonment," "leaks," and "quest." I should also highlight the inefficacy of trying to stop leaks, referencing the Pentagon Papers and the Obama administration's failed attempts.

I need to keep the summary concise, around 200 words, so I'll focus on the most impactful points. I'll structure it to show the pattern of leak-related issues leading to administration problems, using the moral framing words to emphasize the issues like blame-shifting and the futility of stopping leaks.

Finally, I'll ensure the summary flows logically, starting from the Flynn incident, moving through historical context, and ending with the current administration's futile efforts, all while preserving the moral language provided.

SUMMARY: Leaks about Michael Flynn's conversation with Russia's ambassador led to his resignation and highlighted the enduring issue of leaks in Washington. President Trump vowed to "catch" the leakers, but history shows such efforts rarely succeed, often leading to "abandonment" and political fallout, as seen during Watergate. The Nixon administration's creation of the "Plumbers" to stop leaks backfired, resulting in break-ins and eventual downfall. Trump's administration, by treating leakers as the problem, risks repeating this cycle. Despite Trump invoking the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to "stop" leaks, history shows leaks are hard to "find" and prosecute. The Obama administration's record of ten leak investigations failed to gain praise, and the Trump administration's "quest" to halt leaks seems similarly futile. Leaks, like the one involving Reince Priebus and the FBI, continue to "permeate" the government, with Tillerson's leaked memo underscoring the futility of stopping them. The White House's efforts to "regain" control may instead deepen its "misapprehension" of the struggle ahead. END OF SUMMARY.
