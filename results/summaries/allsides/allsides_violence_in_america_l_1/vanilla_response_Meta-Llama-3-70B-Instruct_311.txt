SUMMARY:

A man was shot and killed in Louisville when police and the National Guard opened fire on a crowd in a parking lot. The incident occurred after a night of destructive protests over the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. According to Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, someone in the crowd fired at officers and soldiers, prompting them to return fire. The victim was killed at the scene. An investigation into the fatal shooting has been authorized by Gov. Andy Beshear. Police are interviewing witnesses and collecting video footage, which will be released to the public soon. The incident is likely to escalate tensions in Louisville, where protesters have been demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT who was killed by police in her apartment on March 13. Conrad acknowledged that the incident highlights the lack of trust between the police and the public, an issue that needs to be addressed.
