SUMMARY: One man was killed in Louisville early Monday when police and the National Guard opened fire on a group gathered in a parking lot, authorities said. The incident occurred when law enforcement tried to disperse the crowd and someone in the group fired at them, according to Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad. The National Guard and police returned fire, killing the man. The shooting is likely to inflame tensions in Louisville, where protests have been taking place over the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed 26-year-old African American woman, in March. Gov. Andy Beshear has authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the fatal shooting. Conrad said the police are collecting video footage of the incident and will release it to the public soon. The chief did not address whether the crowd was related to the protests, which were centered about two miles away.
END OF SUMMARY.
