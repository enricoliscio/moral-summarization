SUMMARY:

A fatal shooting occurred in Louisville when police and the National Guard opened fire on a crowd in a parking lot, killing one man. The incident followed a night of destructive protests over the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. According to authorities, the crowd fired at officers and soldiers, prompting them to return fire. The victim's identity has not been released. The police chief acknowledged that the event will likely "inflame tensions" in the city, where protesters have been demanding "justice" for Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT who was killed when police broke down her door to serve a warrant. The chief emphasized that officers are working to "keep people safe and protect property," but noted that many people do not trust the police, an issue that needs to be addressed. The incident is being independently investigated by the Kentucky State Police. The police are collecting video footage and interviewing witnesses, which will be released to the public soon.
