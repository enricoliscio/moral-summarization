SUMMARY:
A violent confrontation between a group gathered in a parking lot and law enforcement resulted in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man by the National Guard and Louisville police. The incident occurred amid ongoing protests in Louisville demanding justice for the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed 26-year-old African American woman. Gov. Andy Beshear has authorized an independent investigation into the latest shooting, which is likely to further inflame tensions in the city. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad acknowledged the issue of trust between the community and law enforcement, pledging to release video footage of the incident soon. The investigation into the fatal shooting is ongoing, with police interviewing witnesses and collecting video evidence. END OF SUMMARY.
