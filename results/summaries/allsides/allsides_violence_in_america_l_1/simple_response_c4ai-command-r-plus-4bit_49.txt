SUMMARY: One man was killed and police and National Guard opened fire on a group gathered in a parking lot in Louisville, in another night of destructive protests over the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor and the death of George Floyd. The crowd, gathered at Dino's Food Mart, fired at law enforcement who were trying to disperse them, according to Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad. The National Guard and Louisville police returned fire, killing one man. This tragic incident underscores the deep mistrust between communities of color and law enforcement, as acknowledged by Conrad. The shooting will likely further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protests demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed African American woman killed by police in a botched raid, have been ongoing. The governor has authorized an independent investigation into the fatal shooting, recognizing the seriousness and moral implications of the situation. This incident highlights the urgent need to address systemic racism and police brutality in the US, and to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they are sworn to protect. 

END OF SUMMARY.
