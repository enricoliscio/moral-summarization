Okay, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article is about a shooting in Louisville where a man was killed when police and the National Guard opened fire. It happened after a confrontation between a group in a parking lot and law enforcement trying to disperse the crowd. The governor authorized an independent investigation. The police chief mentioned that after protests over Breonna Taylor's death and George Floyd's death, they were sent to the parking lot. Someone in the crowd shot at them, so they returned fire, killing one man. The chief didn't name him and mentioned that officers were assaulted and shot at, indicating a lack of trust in the police. They're collecting video footage and interviewing people. The shooting is likely to increase tensions, especially since protests are ongoing for Breonna Taylor, who was killed when police entered her apartment.

So, I need to condense this into a summary of no more than 200 words. I should include the key points: the shooting incident, the context of protests, the involvement of police and National Guard, the cause of the shooting, the investigation, the impact on tensions, and the background of Breonna Taylor's death.

I'll start by stating the shooting incident, then mention the protests, the confrontation, the return fire, the man killed, the investigation, the lack of trust in police, the collection of evidence, and the context of Breonna Taylor's death. I need to keep it concise and make sure all important details are included without going over the word limit.

Let me draft that:

"Louisville police and the National Guard shot and killed a man after a confrontation with a crowd during protests over the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. The incident occurred when law enforcement tried to disperse a group at Dino’s Food Mart. Someone in the crowd fired at officers, leading to a return of fire. Governor Andy Beshear authorized an independent investigation. Police Chief Steve Conrad noted the lack of trust in police and mentioned that officers were assaulted. Authorities are collecting video footage and interviewing witnesses. The shooting is likely to heighten tensions in Louisville, where protests for justice for Breonna Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT killed during a police raid, have been ongoing."

Wait, that's a bit over. Let me check the word count. Hmm, maybe I can make it more concise. Perhaps combine some sentences.

"Louisville police and the National Guard shot and killed a man during a confrontation with a crowd following protests over Breonna Taylor and George Floyd's deaths. The incident happened when law enforcement attempted to disperse a group at Dino’s Food Mart. After someone in the crowd fired at officers, they returned fire, resulting in the man's death. Governor Andy Beshear authorized an independent investigation. Police Chief Steve Conrad stated that officers were assaulted and noted the lack of public trust in law enforcement. Authorities are collecting video footage and interviewing witnesses. The shooting is expected to further escalate tensions in Louisville, where protests for justice for Breonna Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT killed during a police raid, have been ongoing."

That's better. Now, I'll check the word count again. It's within 200 words. I think this captures all the essential points without unnecessary details.
