Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a news summarizer and a moral expert. The task involves two main steps: first, identifying morally framed words from the provided news article, and second, summarizing the article while preserving those moral framings.

First, I need to understand what morally framed words are. These are words that carry a moral connotation, such as "violent," "killed," "protests," etc. They reflect the ethical or moral implications of the events described.

Looking at the news article, I'll go through each sentence to pick out these words. Words like "shot," "killed," "violent confrontation," "protests," "unarmed," "justice," "trust," "assaulted," and "inflame tensions" stand out as they carry moral weight.

Next, I need to summarize the article. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and include as many of these morally framed words as possible. I'll structure the summary to include the key events: the shooting, the involvement of police and National Guard, the context of protests over Breonna Taylor's death, and the resulting tensions.

I should ensure that the summary flows logically, starting with the incident, then the context, and ending with the implications. It's important to mention the governor's investigation and the police chief's comments about trust and safety.

I also need to make sure that the summary doesn't add any new information beyond what's in the article and stays within the word limit. After drafting, I'll review to ensure all morally framed words are included and that the summary accurately reflects the article's content and moral framing.

**SUMMARY:**  
A man was shot and killed during a violent confrontation between law enforcement and a crowd in Louisville, following another night of destructive protests over the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor and the death of George Floyd. Gov. Andy Beshear authorized an independent investigation into the fatal shooting. Louisville police and the National Guard were dispatched to disperse a large crowd at Dinoâ€™s Food Mart, but someone in the crowd fired at officers, leading to a return of fire that killed one man. Police Chief Steve Conrad emphasized the difficulty of keeping people safe and protecting property, acknowledging that many do not trust the police. The shooting is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protests have been demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT who was killed during a police raid. END OF SUMMARY.
