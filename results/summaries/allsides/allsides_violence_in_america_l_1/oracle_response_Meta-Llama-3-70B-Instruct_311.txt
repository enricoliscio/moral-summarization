SUMMARY: A fatal shooting occurred in Louisville when police and the National Guard opened fire on a crowd in a parking lot, killing one man. The incident was sparked by a violent confrontation between the group and law enforcement, who were trying to disperse the crowd. According to authorities, someone in the crowd fired at the officers and soldiers, prompting them to return fire. The killing is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protests have been demanding justice for the death of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT who was shot and killed by police in her apartment on March 13. The police chief acknowledged that many people do not trust the police, and that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. The incident is under investigation, with police collecting video footage and interviewing witnesses. The release of the footage is promised soon. The killing is a tragic addition to the ongoing protests and calls for justice in the face of police violence. END OF SUMMARY.
