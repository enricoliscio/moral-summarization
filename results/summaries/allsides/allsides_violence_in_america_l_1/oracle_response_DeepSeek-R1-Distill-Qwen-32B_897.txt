Okay, I need to summarize the given news article while preserving the moral framing. The user has specified that I should keep as many of the morally charged words as possible. Let me first read through the article to understand the main points.

The article describes a situation in Louisville where police and the National Guard used force, resulting in a man's death. It mentions the context of protests over Breonna Taylor's death and George Floyd's death. The morally framed words include "shot," "killed," "confrontation," "shooting," "protests," "death," "killing," "keep," "assaulted," "inflame," "justice," "broke," "died," "fire."

I need to make sure these words are included in the summary. The summary should be concise, under 200 words, and capture the key events and the moral implications.

First, I'll note the main events: a violent confrontation leading to a shooting, the death of a man, the context of protests over Taylor and Floyd, the police response, and the resulting tension.

I'll structure the summary to include the use of force, the death, the protests, and the impact on community trust. I'll also mention the investigation and the release of video footage.

Now, I'll draft the summary, ensuring all key moral words are included without making it too lengthy. I'll avoid adding any personal opinions, just stick to the facts and the moral framing provided.

Let me check the word count to ensure it's under 200. I'll make sure each sentence is concise and includes the necessary moral terms without redundancy.

Finally, I'll format the summary as per the user's instructions, starting with "SUMMARY:" and ending with "END OF SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: A man was shot and killed during a violent confrontation in Louisville when police and the National Guard fired on a crowd gathered at Dino’s Food Mart. The incident occurred after nights of protests over the death of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Authorities dispatched law enforcement to disperse the crowd, but someone in the crowd fired at officers, leading to a return of fire that resulted in the man’s death. Police Chief Steve Conrad emphasized the difficulty of maintaining trust in law enforcement and pledged to release video footage of the shooting. The fatal shooting is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protests have been demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT killed during a police raid. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges of trust and violence in law enforcement. END OF SUMMARY.
