SUMMARY: One man was shot and killed by the National Guard and Louisville police following a violent confrontation in a parking lot. The incident occurred as law enforcement attempted to disperse a crowd that had gathered there during a night of destructive protests over the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor and the death of George Floyd. Gov. Andy Beshear has authorized an independent investigation into the fatal shooting, and Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has pledged to release video footage soon. The shooting is likely to inflame tensions in Louisville, where protesters have been demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed African American woman who died at the hands of police in March. The police chief acknowledged the lack of trust between the community and law enforcement, stating that it is an issue that needs to be addressed and resolved. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and the identity of the man killed has not yet been released.
END OF SUMMARY.
