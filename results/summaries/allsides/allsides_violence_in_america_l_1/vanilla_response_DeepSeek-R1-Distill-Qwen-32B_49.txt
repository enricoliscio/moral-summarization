Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let's read through it carefully. 

The article talks about a shooting in Louisville where one man was killed when police and the National Guard opened fire. This happened after a confrontation with a group in a parking lot. The governor authorized an independent investigation. 

Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad mentioned that after protests over Breonna Taylor's death and George Floyd's death, they were sent to disperse a crowd. Someone in the crowd shot at them, leading to a return of fire, resulting in one death. Conrad didn't name the victim and acknowledged the lack of trust in police. They're collecting evidence and planning to release video footage. The shooting could escalate tensions, especially since Taylor's case is still a major issue. 

Taylor was killed when police raided her apartment, leading to a fatal exchange of fire. Her death has been a focal point for protests. 

So, the summary needs to include the shooting incident, the context of protests, the involvement of the National Guard, the response leading to the death, the investigation, and the ongoing tensions. I'll keep it concise, under 200 words, and make sure it's clear and captures all key points.
