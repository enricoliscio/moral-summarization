Okay, I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the article is about a shooting incident in Louisville. A man was killed when police and the National Guard opened fire after a confrontation. The governor authorized an investigation. The incident happened at Dino’s Food Mart parking lot during protests over Breonna Taylor's death and George Floyd's death. Someone in the crowd shot at the officers, leading to a return of fire. The police chief mentioned that officers were attacked and that trust in the police is an issue. They’re collecting video and interviewing people. The shooting might escalate tensions in Louisville, where protests are ongoing for Breonna Taylor, an EMT killed during a police raid.

I need to condense this into a summary under 200 words. Focus on the key points: the shooting, the context of protests, the response from authorities, and the implications for tensions. Make sure to mention the authorization of the investigation and the police chief's comments on trust. Also, include the background on Breonna Taylor's death.

Let me structure it: start with the incident, mention the protests, the confrontation, the shooting, the investigation, the chief's statements, and the impact on tensions. Keep it concise and clear.

I should avoid too much detail on Taylor's case since it's background. Maybe just mention her as context. Also, note that the crowd's relation to the protests isn't clear.

I think that's all the main points. Time to put it together succinctly.
