SUMMARY:
One man was unjustly killed by law enforcement in Louisville, Kentucky, during a violent confrontation between a group gathered in a parking lot and police trying to disperse the crowd. This incident further inflames tensions in the city, where protesters have been demanding justice for the death of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed African American woman killed by police in March. The Kentucky National Guard and Louisville police opened fire after someone in the crowd fired at them, according to the police chief, who pledged to release footage of the shooting soon. The governor has authorized an independent investigation into the fatal shooting, given the seriousness of the situation. The chief did not address whether the crowd was related to the protests, which were centered on demanding justice for the deaths of unarmed citizens at the hands of police. The police chief acknowledged the issue of trust between the community and law enforcement, stating that they are "working very hard to keep people safe and protect property" while also being "shot at and assaulted."
END OF SUMMARY.
