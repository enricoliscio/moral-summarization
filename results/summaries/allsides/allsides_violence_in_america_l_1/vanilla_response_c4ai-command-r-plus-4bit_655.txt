SUMMARY: A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, early Monday when police and the National Guard opened fire on a group gathered in a parking lot, authorities said. The incident occurred after another night of protests over the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor and the death of George Floyd. According to Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, law enforcement was trying to disperse the crowd when someone in the group fired at them, leading to both the National Guard and police returning fire. The man killed has not been identified. Gov. Andy Beshear has authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the shooting. Conrad acknowledged the issue of trust between the community and the police and pledged to release video footage of the incident soon. The shooting is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protesters have been demanding justice for Taylor's death. Taylor, an unarmed 26-year-old African American EMT, was fatally shot by police during a botched raid on her apartment in March.
END OF SUMMARY.
