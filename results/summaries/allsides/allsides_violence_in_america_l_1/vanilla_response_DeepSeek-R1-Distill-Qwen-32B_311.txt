Alright, so I need to summarize this news article. Let me read through it carefully.

The article starts by mentioning that a man was shot and killed in Louisville when police and the National Guard opened fire after a confrontation. The governor authorized an independent investigation. The incident happened at a parking lot near Dinoâ€™s Food Mart around midnight. The crowd was there after protests over Breonna Taylor's death and George Floyd's death. Someone in the crowd shot at the officers, leading to a return of fire, resulting in one death. The police chief mentioned the lack of trust in the police and that they're collecting evidence, including video footage. The shooting is expected to increase tensions in Louisville, especially since Taylor's death is a focal point for protesters.

I need to make sure the summary includes the key points: the shooting incident, the involvement of police and National Guard, the context of protests related to Taylor and Floyd, the response from authorities, and the impact on tensions. I should keep it under 200 words and structure it clearly.

Let me draft the summary, ensuring it's concise and covers all necessary details without going into too much depth on each point. I'll also make sure to include the governor's statement and the police chief's comments about the situation.
