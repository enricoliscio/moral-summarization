SUMMARY:

A man was shot and killed in Louisville when police and the National Guard opened fire on a crowd gathered in a parking lot. The incident occurred after authorities attempted to disperse the crowd, which led to someone in the crowd firing at officers and soldiers. Both the National Guard and Louisville police returned fire, resulting in the death of one man. The incident is under investigation, with police collecting video footage and interviewing witnesses. The fatal shooting is likely to escalate tensions in Louisville, where protests have been ongoing over the death of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed African American EMT who was killed by police in her apartment on March 13. The governor has authorized an independent investigation into the fatal shooting. The police chief acknowledged that the incident highlights the lack of trust between the police and the community, an issue that needs to be addressed.
