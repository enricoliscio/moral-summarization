SUMMARY: One man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, early Monday morning when the National Guard and police returned fire after someone in a crowd fired at them, authorities said. The shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. in a parking lot where a large crowd had gathered, Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad said. It's unclear if the crowd was related to the protests over the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd that have rocked the city for days. Gov. Andy Beshear has authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the fatal shooting. Conrad said the police are working to keep people safe and protect property, but acknowledged that many people do not trust the police, which is an issue that needs to be addressed. He also said the police are collecting video footage of the shooting and plan to release it to the public soon. The fatal shooting is likely to inflame tensions in Louisville, where protesters have been demanding justice for Taylor, a 26-year-old African American woman who was fatally shot by police in March.
END OF SUMMARY.
